friedrich nietzsche on the genealogy of morals prologue we dont know ourselves we knowledgeable peoplewe are personally ignorant about ourselves and theres good reason for that weve never tried to find out who we are how could it ever happen that one day wed discover our own selves with justice its been said that where your treasure is there shall your heart be also our treasure lies where the beehives of our knowledge stand we are always busy with our knowledge as if we were born winged creaturescollectors of intellectual honey in our hearts we are basically concerned with only one thing to bring something home as far as the rest of life is concerned what people call experiencewhich of us is serious enough for that who has enough time in these matters i fear weve been missing the point our hearts have not even been engagednor for that matter have our ears weve been much more like someone divinely distracted and selfabsorbed into whose ear the clock has just pealed the twelve strokes of noon with all its force and who all at once wakes up and asks himself what exactly did that clock strikeso we rub ourselves behind the ears afterwards and ask totally surprised and embarrassed what have we really just experienced and more who are we really then as ive mentioned we countafter the factall the twelve trembling strokes of the clock of our experience our lives our beingalas in the process we keep losing the count so we remain necessarily strangers to ourselves we do not understand ourselves we have to keep ourselves confused for us this law holds for all eternity each man is furthest from himself where we ourselves are concerned we are not knowledgeable people my thoughts over the origin of our moral prejudicesfor this polemical tract is concerned about that originhad their first brief and provisional expression in that collection of aphorisms which carried the title human alltoo human a book for free spirits a book which i started to write in sorrento during a winter when i had the chance to pause just as a traveller stops to look over the wide and dangerous land through which my spirit had wandered up to that point this happened in the winter but the ideas themselves are older in the main points they were the same ideas which i am taking up again in these present essays lets hope that the long interval of time has done them some good that they have become riper brighter stronger and more complete the fact that today i still stand by these ideas that in the intervening time they themselves have constantly become more strongly associated with one another even to the point of growing into each other and intertwining that has reinforced in me the joyful confidence that they may not have originally developed in me as single random or sporadic ideas but up out of common roots from some fundamental will for knowledge ruling from deep within always speaking with greater clarity always demanding greater clarity in fact thats the only thing appropriate for a philosopher we have no right to be isolated in any way we are not permitted to make isolated mistakes or to run into isolated truths our ideas our values our affirmations and denials our ifs and butsthese rather grow out of us from the same necessity which makes a tree bear its fruittotally related and interlinked amongst each other witnesses of one will one health one soil one sun as for the question whether these fruits of ours taste good to you what does that matter to the trees what concern is that of ours we philosophers because of a quirk in my own nature to which i confess reluctantly for it concerns itself with morality with everything which up to the present has been celebrated on earth as morality a quirk which came into my life early so uninvited so irresistibly in such contradiction to my surroundings my age the examples around me and my origin that i almost have the right to call it my a prioribecause of this my curiosity and my suspicions soon enough had to pause at the question about where our good and evil really originated in fact already as a thirteenyearold lad i was confronted with the problem of the origin of evil at an age when one has half childish play half god in ones heart i devoted my first childish literary trifle my first written philosophical exercise to this problem and so far as my solution to the problem at that time is concerned well i gave that honour to god as is reasonable and made him the father of evil is that what my a priori demanded of me precisely that new immoral at the very least unmoral a priori and the cryptic categorical imperative which spoke out from it alas so antikantian which i have increasingly listened to ever sinceand not just listened to luckily i soon learned to separate theological prejudices from moral ones and i no longer sought the origin of evil behind the world some education in history and philology along with an inherently refined sense concerning psychological questions in general quickly changed my problem into something else under what conditions did men invent for themselves these value judgments good and evil and what inherent value do they have have they hindered or fostered human wellbeing up to now are they a sign of some emergency of impoverishment of an atrophying life or is it the other way arounddo they indicate fullness power a will for living courage confidence the future from there i came across and proposed all sorts of answers for myself i distinguished between ages peoples different ranks of individuals i kept refining my problem out of the answers arose new questions investigations assumptions probabilitiesuntil at last i had my own country my own soil a totally secluded flowering blooming world like a secret garden of which no one had the slightest inkling oh how lucky we are we knowledgeable people provided that we know how to stay silent long enough the first stimulus to publish something of my hypothesis concerning the origin of morality was given to me by a lucid tidy clever even precocious little book in which for the first time i clearly ran into a topsyturvy and perverse type of genealogical hypothesisa genuinely english style it drew me with that power of attraction which everything opposite everything antipodal contains the title of this booklet was the origin of the moral feelings its author was dr paul re and it appeared in the year its likely i have never read anything which i would have denied statement by statement conclusion by conclusion as i did with this book but without any sense of annoyance or impatience in the work i mentioned above on which i was working at the time i made opportune and inopportune references to statements in dr res book not in order to prove them wrong what have i to do with preparing such refutations but as is appropriate to a positive spirit to put in the place of something unlikely something more likely in the place of some error in detail some other error at that time as i said for the first time i brought into the light of day my hypotheses about genealogy to which these essays have been dedicatedbut clumsily as i will be the last to deny still fettered still without my own language for these concerns of mine and with all sorts of retreating and vacillating for particular details you should compare what i said in human alltoo human on p about the double nature of the prehistory of good and evil that is in the spheres of the nobility and the slaves similarly pages ff concerning the worth and origin of ascetic morality as well as pages and concerning the morality of custom that much older and more primitive style of morality which lies an enormous distance from the altruistic way of valuing which dr re like all english genealogists of morality sees as the very essence of moral evaluation similarly p of the wanderer and p of the dawn concerning the origin of justice as a compromise between approximately equal powers equality as a precondition of all contracts and therefore of justice likewise concerning the origin of punishment in wanderer p for which an intent to terrify is neither the essential thing nor the origin as dr re claimsit is far more likely first brought in under a specific set of conditions and always as something incidental something additional but basically even then the real concern for me at heart was something much more important than coming up with hypotheses about the origin of morality either my own or from other people or more precisely statedthis latter issue was important to me only for the sake of a goal to which it was one path out of many for me the issue was the value of moralityand in that matter i had to take issue almost alone with my great teacher schopenhauer to whom as if to a contemporary that book with its passion and hidden contradiction addressed itself for that book was also a polemical tract the most specific issue was the worth of the unegoistic the instinct for pity selfdenial selfsacrifice something which schopenhauer himself had painted with gold deified and projected into the next world for so long that it finally became for him value in itself and the reason why he said no to life and even to himself but a constantly more fundamental suspicion of exactly this instinct voiced itself in me a scepticism which always dug deeper it was precisely here that i saw the great danger to humanity its most sublime temptation and seduction but in what direction to nothingness it was precisely here i saw the beginning of the end the standing still the backwardglancing exhaustion the will turning itself against life the final illness tenderly and sadly announcing itself i understood the morality of pity which was always seizing more and more around it even the philosophers which it made sick as the most sinister symptom of our european culture which itself had become sinister as its detour to a new buddhism to a european buddhism to nihilism this modern philosophical preference for and overvaluing of pity is really something new concerning the worthlessness of pity philosophers up to now were in agreement i name only plato spinoza la rochefoucauld and kantfour spirits as different from one another as possible but united in one thing in the low value they set on pity this problem of the value of pity and of the morality of pity im an opponent of the disgraceful modern immaturity of feelings appeared at first to be only something isolated a detached question mark but anyone who remains there for a while and learns some questions will experience what happened to mea huge new vista opens up before him a possibility grips him like an attack of dizziness all sorts of mistrust suspicion and fear spring uphis belief in morality in all morality starts to totter and finally he hears a new demand lets proclaim this new demand we need a critique of moral values and we must first question the very value of these values for that we need a knowledge of the conditions and circumstance out of which these values grew under which they have developed and changed morality as consequence as symptom as mask as hypocrisy as illness as misunderstandingbut also morality as cause as means of healing as stimulant as scruples as poison a knowledge of the sort which has not been there until now something which has not even been wished for people have taken the worth of these values as something given as selfevident as beyond all dispute up until now people have also not had the least doubts about or wavered in setting up the good man as more valuable than the evil man of higher worth in the sense of the improvement usefulness and prosperity of mankind in general along with the future of humanity now what about this what if the truth were the other way around what if in the good there lay a symptom of regression something like a danger a seduction a poison a narcotic something which makes the present live at the cost of the future perhaps something more comfortable less dangerous but also on a smaller scale something more demeaning so that this very morality would be guilty if the highest possible power and magnificence of the human type were never attained so that this very morality might be the danger of all dangers for me it was enough that once this insight revealed itself to me i had a reason to look around for learned bold and hardworking comrades today im still searching its a matter of traveling through the immense distant and so secretive land of the morality which was really there the land of really living morality with nothing but new questions and as it were new eyes isnt that almost like first discovering this land in this matter i thought of among others the abovementioned dr re because i happened to have no doubts at all that by the very nature of his questions he would be driven to a more correct methodology in order to arrive at any answers have i deceived myself in all this at any rate my desire was to provide a better direction for such a keen and objective eye as his a direction leading to a true history of morality and to advise him in time against the english way of making hypotheses by staring off into the blue for indeed its obvious which colour must be a hundred times more important for someone seeking a genealogy of morals than this bluenamely gray in other words what has been documented what can be established as the truth what really took place in short the long difficulttodecipher hieroglyphic writing of the past in human morality this was unknown to dr re but he had read darwin so that to some extent in his hypotheses the darwinian beast and the most modern modest and tender moral sensibility which no longer bites politely extend their hands to each other in a way that is at least entertainingwith the latter bearing a facial expression revealing a certain goodnatured and refined indolence in which is mixed a grain of pessimism and exhaustion as if it is really not worth taking all these things the problems of morality so seriously for me things appear reversedthere are no issues which are more worth taking seriouslyamong the rewards for example is the fact that one day perhaps people will be permitted to take them cheerfully for cheerfulness or to say it in my own language the gay science is a reward a reward for a lengthy brave hardworking and underground seriousness which of course is not something for everyone but on that day when from full hearts we say forward our old morality also belongs in a comedy well have discovered a new complication and possibility for the dionysian drama of the fate of the soul and we can bet that the grand old immortal comic poet of our existence will put it to good use if this writing is incomprehensible to someone or other and hurts his ears the blame for that it strikes me is not necessarily mine the writing is sufficiently clear given the conditions i set outthat you have first read my earlier writings and have taken some trouble to do that for in fact these works are not easily accessible for example so far as my zarathustra is concerned i dont consider anyone knowledgeable about it who has not at some time or another been deeply wounded by and profoundly delighted with every word in it for only then can he enjoy the privilege of sharing with reverence in the halcyon element out of which that work was born in its sunny clarity distance breadth and certainty in other cases the aphoristic form creates difficulties which stem from the fact that nowadays people dont take this form seriously enough an aphorism properly stamped and poured has not been deciphered simply by being read its much more the case that only now can one begin to explicate itand that requires an art of interpretation in the third essay of this book i have set out a model of what i call an interpretation for such a case in this essay an aphorism is presented and the essay itself is a commentary on it of course in order to practice this style of reading as an art one thing is above all essentialsomething that today has been thoroughly forgotten and so it will require still more time before my writings are readablesomething for which one almost needs to be a cow at any rate not a modern manrumination silsmaria oberengadin july first essay good and evil good and bad these english psychologists whom we have to thank for the only attempts up to this point to produce a history of the origins of moralityin themselves they serve up to us no small riddle in the way of a lively riddle they even offer i confess something substantially more than their booksthey are interesting in themselves these english psychologistswhat do they really want we find them willingly or unwillingly always at the same work that is hauling the partie honteuse shameful part of our inner world into the foreground in order to look right there for the truly effective and operative force which has determined our development the very place where mans intellectual pride least wishes to find it for example in the vis inertiae force of inertia of habit or in forgetfulness or in a blind contingent mechanical joining of ideas or in something else purely passive automatic reflex molecular and completely stupidwhat is it that really drives these psychologists always in this particular direction is it a secret malicious common instinct perhaps one which is selfdeceiving for belittling humanity or something like a pessimistic suspicion the mistrust of idealists whove become disappointed gloomy venomous and green or a small underground hostility and rancour towards christianity and plato which perhaps has never once managed to cross the threshold of consciousness or even a lecherous taste for what is odd or painfully paradoxical for what in existence is questionable and ridiculous or finally a bit of all of thesea little vulgarity a little gloominess a little hostility to christianity a little thrill and a need for pepper but people tell me that these men are simply old cold boring frogs who creep and hop around people as if they were in their own proper element that is in a swamp i resist that idea when i hear it whats more i dont believe it and if one is permitted to hope where one cannot know then i hope from my heart that the situation with these men could be reversed that these investigators peering at the soul through their microscopes could be thoroughly brave generous and proud animals who know how to control their hearts and their pain and who have educated themselves to sacrifice everything desirable for the sake of the truth for the sake of every truth even the simple the bitter the hateful the repellent the unchristian the unmoral truth for there are such truths so all respect to the good spirits that may govern in these historians of morality but its certainly a pity that they lack the historical spirit itself that theyve been left in the lurch by all the good spirits of history collectively they all think essentially unhistorically in what is now the traditional manner of philosophers of that there is no doubt the incompetence of their genealogies of morals reveals itself at the very beginning where the issue is to determine the origin of the idea and of the judgment good people so they proclaim originally praised unegoistic actions and called them good from the perspective of those for whom they were done that is those for whom such actions were useful later people forgot how this praise began and because unegoistic actions had according to custom always been praised as good people then simply felt them as good as if they were something inherently good we see right away that this initial derivation already contains all the typical characteristics of the idiosyncrasies of english psychologistswe have usefulness forgetting habit and finally error all as the foundation for an evaluation in which the higher man up to this time has taken pride as if it were a sort of privilege of men generally this pride should be humbled this evaluation of worth emptied of value has that been achieved now first of all its obvious to me that from this theory the origin of the idea good has been sought for and established in the wrong place the judgment good did not move here from those to whom goodness was shown it is much more that case that the good people themselves that is the noble powerful higherranking and higherthinking people felt and set themselves and their actions up as good that is to say of the first rank in contrast to everything low lowminded common and vulgar from this pathos of distance they first arrogated to themselves the right to create values to stamp out the names for values what did they care about usefulness in relation to such a hot pouring out of the highest rankordering ranksetting judgments of value the point of view which considers utility is as foreign and inappropriate as possible here the feeling has reached the opposite of that low level of warmth which is a condition for that calculating shrewdness that calculation by utilityand not just for a moment not for an exceptional hour but permanently the pathos of nobility and distance as mentioned the lasting and domineering feeling something total and complete of a higher ruling nature in relation to a lower nature to a beneaththat is the origin of the opposition between good and bad the right of the master to give names extends so far that we could permit ourselves to grasp the origin of language itself as an expression of the power of the rulers they say that is such and such seal every object and event with a sound and in the process as it were take possession of it given this origin the word good was not in any way necessarily tied up with unegoistic actions as it is in the superstitions of those genealogists of morality rather that occurs for the first time with the collapse of aristocratic value judgments when this entire contrast between egoistic and unegoistic pressed itself ever more strongly into human awarenessit is to use my own words the instinct of the herd which through this contrast finally gets its word and its words and even so it took a long time until this instinct in the masses became master with the result that moral evaluation got thoroughly hung up and bogged down on this opposition as is the case for example in modern europe today the prejudice that takes moralistic unegoistic and dsintress disinterested as equally valuable ideas already governs with the force of a fixed idea and a disease of the brain secondly however and quite separate from the fact that this hypothesis about the origin of the value judgment good is historically untenable it suffers from an inherent psychological contradiction the utility of the unegoistic action is supposed to be the origin of the praise it receives and this origin has allegedly been forgotten but how is this forgetting even possible could the usefulness of such actions at some time or other perhaps just have stopped the case is the opposite this utility has rather been an everyday experience throughout the ages and thus something that has always been constantly reemphasized hence instead of disappearing out of consciousness instead of becoming something forgettable it must have pressed itself into the consciousness with everincreasing clarity how much more sensible is the contrasting theory which is not therefore closer to the truth for example the one which is advocated by herbert spencer he proposes that the idea good is essentially the same as the idea useful or functional so that in judgments about good and bad human beings sum up and endorse the experiences they have not forgotten and cannot forget concerning the usefulfunctional and the harmfuluseless according to this theory good is something which has always proved useful so that it may assert its validity as valuable in the highest degree or as valuable in itself this path to an explanation is as mentioned also false but at least the account itself is sensible and psychologically tenable i was given a hint of the right direction by this question what from an etymological perspective do the meanings of good as manifested in different languages really mean there i found that all of them lead back to the same transformation of ideas that everywhere noble or aristocratic in a social sense is the fundamental idea out of which good in the sense of spiritually noble aristocratic spiritually highminded spiritually privileged necessarily developa process which always runs in parallel with that other one which finally transforms common vulgar and low into the concept bad the most eloquent example of the latter is the german word schlectbad itselfwhich is identical with the word schlicht plaincompare schlectweg quite simply and schlechterdings simply originally these words designated the plain common man but without any suspicious side glance simply in contrast to the nobility around the time of the thirty years war approximatelyhence late enoughthis sense changed into the one used now as far as the genealogy of morals is concerned this point strikes me as a fundamental insightthat it was first discovered so late we can ascribe to the repressive influence which democratic prejudice in the modern world exercises over all questions of origin and this occurs in what appears to be the most objective realm of natural science and physiology a point which i can only hint at here but the sort of mischief this prejudice can cause once it has become unleashed as hatred particularly where morality and history are concerned is revealed in the wellknown case of buckle the plebeian nature of the modern spirit which originated in england broke out once again on its home turf as violently as a muddy volcano and with the same salty overloud and common eloquence with which all previous volcanoes have spoken with respect to our problemwhich for good reasons we can call a quiet problem so refined that it directs itself only at a few earsthere is no little interest in establishing the point that often in those words and roots which designate good there still shines through the main nuance of what made the nobility feel they were men of higher rank its true that in most cases they perhaps named themselves simply after their superiority in power as the powerful the masters those in command or after the most visible sign of their superiority for example as the rich or the owners that is the meaning of arya and the corresponding words in iranian and slavic but they also named themselves after a typical characteristic and that is the case which is our concern here for instance they called themselves the truthfulabove all the greek nobility whose mouthpiece is the megarian poet theogonis the word developed for this characteristicesthlos fine nobleindicates according to its root meaning a man who is who possess reality who really exists then with a subjective transformation it indicates the true man as the truthful man in this phase of conceptual transformation it became the slogan and catch phrase for the nobility and its sense shifted entirely over to aristocratic to mark a distinction from the lying common man as theogonis takes and presents him until finally after the decline of the nobility the word remains as a designation of spiritual nobility and becomes as it were ripe and sweet in the word kakos weak worthless as in the word deilos cowardly the plebeian in contrast to the agathos good excellent the cowardice is emphasized this perhaps provides a hint about the direction in which we have to seek the etymological origin for the multiple meanings of agathos in the latin word malus bad which i place alongside melas black the common man could be designated as the darkcoloured above all as the darkhaired hic niger est this man is black as the prearyan inhabitant of italian soil who stood out from those who became dominant the blonds that is the conquering race of aryans most clearly through this colour at any rate the gaelic race offers me an exactly corresponding example the word fin for example in the name fingal the term designating nobility and finally the good noble and pure originally referred to the blondheaded man in contrast to the dusky darkhaired original inhabitants incidentally the celts were a thoroughly blond race people are wrong when they link the traces of a basically darkhaired population which are noticeable on the carefully prepared ethnographic maps of germany with any celtic origin and mixing of blood as virchow does it is much rather the case that in these places the prearyan population of germany emerged the same is true for almost all of europe essentially the conquered races finally attained the upper hand for themselves once again in colour shortness of skull perhaps even in the intellectual and social instincts who can confirm for us that modern democracy the even more modern anarchism and indeed that preference for the commune for the primitive form of society which all european socialists now share does not indicate a monstrous counterattack and that the ruling and master race the aryans is not being defeated even physiologically the latin word bonus good i believe i can explicate as the warrior provided that i am correct in tracing bonus back to an older word duonus compare bellum war duellum war duenlum which seems to me to contain that word duonus hence bonus as a man of war of division duo as a warrior we can see what constituted a mans goodness in ancient rome what about our german word gut good itself doesnt it indicate den gttlichen the godlike man the man of gttlichen geschlechts the generation of gods and isnt that identical to the peoples originally the nobles name for the goths the basis for this hypothesis does not belong here from this rule that the concept of political superiority always resolves itself into the concept of spiritual priority it is not really an exception although there is room for exceptions when the highest caste is also the priest caste and consequently for its total range of meanings prefers a scale of values which recalls its priestly function so for example for the first time the words pure and impure appear as marks of ones social position and later a good and a bad develop which no longer refer to social position incidentally people should be warned not to take these ideas of pure and impure from the outset too seriously too broadly or even symbolically all the ideas of ancient humanity are initially to be understood to a degree we can hardly imagine much more as coarse crude superficial narrow blunt and in particular unsymbolic the pure man is from the start simply a man who washes himself who forbids himself certain foods which produce diseases of the skin who doesnt sleep with the dirty women of the lower people who has a horror of bloodno more not much more on the other hand from the very nature of an essentially priestly aristocracy it is clear enough how even here early on the opposition between different evaluations could become dangerously internalized and sharpened and in fact they finally ripped open fissures between man and man over which even an achilles of the free spirit could not cross without shivering from the very beginning there is something unhealthy about such priestly aristocracies and about the customary attitudes which govern in them which turn away from action sometimes brooding sometimes exploding with emotion as a result of which in the priests of almost all ages there have appeared almost unavoidably debilitating intestinal illness and neurasthenia but what they themselves came up with as a remedy for this pathological diseasesurely we can assert that it has finally shown itself through its effects as even a hundred times more dangerous than the illness for which it was meant to provide relief human beings are still sick from the aftereffects of this priestly navet in healing lets think for example of certain forms of diet avoiding meat of fasting of celibacy of the flight into the desert weir mitchells isolation but naturally without the fattening up cure and overeating which follow ita treatment which constitutes the most effective treatment for all hysteria induced by the ideals of asceticism consider also the whole metaphysic of the priestsso hostile to the senses making men so lazy and sophisticatedor the way they hypnotize themselves in the manner of fakirs and brahminsbrahmanism employed as a glass head and a fixed idea consider finally the only too understandable and common dissatisfaction with its radical cure with nothingness or godthe desire for a unio mystica mystical union with god is the desire of the buddhist for nothingness nirvananothing more among the priests everything mentioned above becomes more dangerousnot only the remedies and arts of healing but also pride vengeance mental acuity excess love thirst for power virtue illnessalthough its fair enough to add that on the foundation of this basically dangerous form of human existence the priest for the first time the human being became in general an interesting animal that here the human soul first attained depth in a higher sense and became eviland indeed these are the two fundamental reasons for humanitys superiority up to now over other animals you will have already guessed how easily the priestly way of evaluating could split from the knightlyaristocratic and then continue to develop into its opposite such a development receives a special stimulus every time the priest caste and the warrior caste confront each other jealously and are not willing to agree about the winner the knightlyaristocratic judgments of value have as their basic assumption a powerful physicality a blooming rich even overflowing health together with those things which are required to maintain these qualitieswar adventure hunting dancing war games and in general everything which involves strong free happy action the priestlynoble method of evaluating has as we saw other preconditions these make it difficult enough for them when it comes to war as is well known priests are the most evil of enemiesbut why because they are the most powerless from their powerlessness their hate grows into something immense and terrifying to the most spiritual and most poisonous manifestations those who have been the greatest haters in world history and the most spiritually rich haters have always been the priestsin comparison with the spirit of priestly revenge all the remaining spirits are in general hardly worth considering human history would be a really stupid affair without that spirit which entered it from the powerless let us quickly consider the greatest example everything on earth which has been done against the nobility the powerful the masters the possessors of power is not worth mentioning in comparison with what the jews have done against themthe jews that priestly people who knew how to get final satisfaction from their enemies and conquerors through a radical transformation of their values that is through an act of the most spiritual revenge this was appropriate only to a priestly people with the most deeply rooted priestly desire for revenge in opposition to the aristocratic value equations good noble powerful beautiful fortunate loved by god the jews with a consistency inspiring fear dared to reverse it and to hang on to that with the teeth of the most profound hatred the hatred of the powerless that is to only those who suffer are good the poor the powerless the low are the only good people the suffering those in need the sick the ugly are also the only pious people only they are blessed by god for them alone there is salvation by contrast you privileged and powerful people you are for all eternity the evil the cruel the lecherous the insatiable the godlessyou will also be the unblessed the cursed and the damned for all eternity we know who inherited this judaic transformation of values in connection with that huge and immeasurably disastrous initiative which the jews launched with this most fundamental of all declarations of war i recall the sentence i wrote at another time in beyond good and evil p namely that with the jews the slave condition in morality begins that condition which has a twothousandyearold history behind it and which we nowadays no longer notice because it has triumphed but you fail to understand that you have no eye for something that needed two millennia to emerge victorious thats nothing to wonder at all lengthy things are hard to see to assess however thats what took place out of the trunk of that tree of vengeance and hatred jewish hatredthe deepest and most sublime hatred that is a hatred which creates ideals and transforms values something whose like has never been seen on earthfrom that grew something just as incomparable a new love the deepest and most sublime of all the forms of love from what other trunk could that have grown however you must not make the mistake of thinking that this love arose essentially as the denial of that thirst for vengeance as the opposite of jewish hatred no the reverse is the truth this love grew out of that hatred as its crown as the victorious crown extending itself wider and wider in the purest brightness and sunshine which so to speak was seeking for the kingdom of light and height the goal of that hateaiming for victory trophies seduction with the same urgency with which the roots of that hatred were sinking down ever deeper and more greedily into everything deep and evil take this jesus of nazareth the bodily evangelist of love the saviour who brought holiness and victory to the poor to the sick to the sinners was he not in fact seduction in its most terrible and irresistible form the seduction and detour to exactly those judaic values and new ideals didnt israel in fact attain with the detour of this saviour with this apparent enemy to and dissolver of israel the final goal of its sublime thirst for vengeance isnt it part of the secret black art of a truly great politics of vengeance a farsighted underground slowly expropriating and premeditated revenge that israel itself had to disown and nail to the cross like some mortal enemy the tool essential to its revenge before all the world so that all the world that is all israels enemies could then swallow this bait without a second thought on the other hand could anyone using the full subtlety of his mind imagine a more dangerous bait something to match the enticing intoxicating narcotizing corrupting power of that symbol of the holy cross that ghastly paradox of a god on the cross that mystery of an unimaginable and ultimate final cruelty and selfcrucifixion of god for the salvation of mankind at least it is certain that sub hoc signo under this sign israel with its vengeance and revaluation of the worth of all other previous values has triumphed again and again over all other ideals over all nobler ideals but what are you doing still talking about more noble ideals lets look at the facts the people have triumphedor the slaves or the rabble or the herd or whatever you want to call themif this has taken place because of the jews then good for them no people had a more worldhistorical mission the masters have been disposed of the morality of the common man has won we may take this victory as a blood poisoning it did mix the races upi dont deny that but this intoxication has undoubtedly been successful the salvation of the human race namely from the masters is well under way everything is visibly turning jewish or christian or plebeian what do the words matter the progress of this poison through the entire body of humanity seems irresistiblealthough its tempo and pace may seem from now on constantly slower more delicate less audible more circumspectwell we have time enough from this point of view does the church today still have necessary work to do does it really have a right to exist or could we dispense with it quaeritur thats a question to be asked it seems that it obstructs and hinders the progress of this poison instead of speeding it up well that might even be what makes the church useful certainly the church is something positively gross and vulgar which a more delicate intelligence a truly modern taste resists should the church at least not be something more sophisticated today the church alienates more than it seduces who among us would really be a free spirit if the church were not there the church repels us not its poison apart from the church we love the poison this is the epilogue of a free thinker to my speech an honest animal who has revealed himself welland in addition hes a democrat he listened to me up that that point and couldnt bear to hear my silence but for me at this point there is much to be silent about the slave revolt in morality begins when the resentment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values the resentment of those beings who are prevented from a genuinely active reaction and who compensate for that with a merely imaginary vengeance while all noble morality grows out of a triumphant selfaffirmation slave morality from the start says no to what is outside other a nonself and this no is its creative act this transformation of the glance which confers valuethis necessary projection towards what is outer instead of back onto itselfthat is inherent in resentment in order to arise slave morality always requires first an opposing world a world outside itself psychologically speaking it needs external stimuli in order to act at all its action is basically reaction the reverse is the case with the noble method of valuing it acts and grows spontaneously it seeks its opposite only to affirm itself even more thankfully with even more rejoicing its negative concept of low common bad is only a pale contrasting image after the fact in relation to its positive basic concept thoroughly intoxicated with life and passion we are noble good beautiful and happy when the noble way of evaluating makes a mistake and abuses reality that happens with reference to the sphere which it does not know well enough indeed the sphere it has strongly resisted learning the truth about under certain circumstances it misjudges the sphere it despisesthe sphere of the common man the low people on the other hand we should consider that even assuming that the feeling of contempt of looking down or of looking superior falsifies the image of the person despised such distortion will fall short by a long way of the distortion with which the repressed hatred and vengeance of the powerless man mistakenly assault his opponentnaturally in effigy in fact in contempt there is too much negligence too much dismissiveness too much looking away and impatience all mixed together even too much feeling of joy for it to be capable of converting its object into a truly distorted monster we should not fail to hear the almost benevolent nuances which for a greek noble for example lay in all the words with which he set himself above the lower peoplehow a constant form of pity consideration and forbearance is mixed in there sweetening the words to the point where almost all words which refer to the common man finally remain as expressions for unhappy worthy of pity compare deilos cowardly deilaios lowly mean poneros oppressed by toil wretched mochtheros suffering wretchedthe last two basically designating the common man as a slave worker and beast of burden on the other hand for the greek ear the words bad low unhappy have never stopped echoing a single note one tone colour in which unhappy predominates that is the inheritance of the old noble aristocratic way of evaluating which does not betray its principles even in contempt philologists might recall the sense in which oizuros miserable anolbos unblessed tlemon wretched dustychein unfortunate xymfora misfortune were used the well born felt that they were the happy ones they did not have to construct their happiness artificially first by looking at their enemies or in some circumstance to talk themselves into it to lie to themselves the way all men of resentment habitually do similarly they knew as complete men overloaded with power and thus necessarily active they must not separate action from happiness they considered being active necessarily associated with happiness thats where the phrase eu prattein do well succeed derives its originall this is very much the opposite of happiness at the level of the powerless the oppressed those festering with poisonous and hostile feelings among whom happiness comes out essentially as a narcotic an anesthetic quiet peace sabbath relaxing the soul stretching ones limbs in short as something passive while the noble man lives for himself with trust and candour gennaios meaning of noble birth stresses the nuance upright and also probably nave the man of resentment is neither upright nor nave nor honest and direct with himself his soul squints his spirit loves hiding places secret paths and back doors everything furtive attracts him as his world his security his refreshment he understands about remaining silent not forgetting waiting temporarily diminishing himself humiliating himself a race of such men of resentment will necessarily end up cleverer than any noble race it will value cleverness to a very different extent that is as a condition of existence of the utmost importance whereas cleverness among noble men easily acquires a delicate aftertaste of luxury and sophistication about it here it is not nearly so important as the complete certainly of the ruling unconscious instincts or even a certain lack of cleverness something like brave recklessness whether in the face of danger or of an enemy or wildly enthusiastic sudden fits of anger love reverence thankfulness and vengefulness by which in all ages noble souls have recognized each other the resentment of the noble man himself if it comes over him consumes and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction and therefore does not poison on the other hand in countless cases it just does not appear at all whereas in the case of all weak and powerless people it is unavoidable the noble man cannot take his enemies his misfortunes even his bad deeds seriously for very longthat is the mark of strong complete natures in whom there is a surplus of plastic creative healing power as well as the power to forget a good example for that from the modern world is mirabeau who had no memory of the insults and maliciousness people directed at him and who therefore could not forgive because he just forgot such a man with a single shrug throws off himself all those worms which eat into other men only here is possible provided that it is at all possible on earth the real love for ones enemy how much respect a noble man already has for his enemies and such a respect is already a bridge to love in fact he demands his enemy for himself as his mark of honour indeed he has no enemy other than one who has nothing to despise and a great deal to respect by contrast imagine for yourself the enemy as a man of resentment conceives himand right here we have his action his creation he has conceptualized the evil enemy the evil one as a fundamental ideaand from that he now thinks his way to an opposite image and counterpart a good manhimself we see exactly the opposite with the noble man who conceives the fundamental idea good in advance and spontaneously by himself and from there first creates a picture of bad for himself this bad originating from the noble man and that evil arising out of the stew pot of insatiable hatredof these the first is a later creation an afterthought a complementary colour whereas the second is the original the beginning the essential act of conception in slave morality although the two words bad and evil both seem opposite to the same idea of good how different they are but it is not the same idea of the good it is much rather a question of who the evil man really is in the sense of the morality of resentment the strict answer to that is as follows precisely the good man of the other morality the noble man himself the powerful the ruling man only coloured over reinterpreted and seen only through the poisonous eyes of resentment here there is one thing we will be the last to deny the man who knows these good men only as enemies knows them as nothing but evil enemies and the same men who are so strongly bound by custom honour habit thankfulness even more by mutual suspicion and jealousy inter pares among equals and who by contrast demonstrate in relation to each other such resourceful consideration selfcontrol refinement loyalty pride and friendshipthese men once outside where the strange world the foreign begins are not much better than beasts of prey turned loose there they enjoy freedom from all social constraints in the wilderness they make up for the tension which a long fencedin confinement within the peace of the community brings about they go back to the innocent consciousness of a wild beast of prey as joyful monsters who perhaps walk away from a dreadful sequence of murder arson rape and torture with exhilaration and spiritual equilibrium as if they had merely pulled off a student prank convinced that the poets now have something more to sing about and praise for a long time to come at the bottom of all these noble races we cannot fail to recognize the beast of prey the blond beast splendidly roaming around in its lust for loot and victory this hidden basis from time to time needs to be discharged the animal must come out again must go back into the wildernessroman arab german japanese nobility homeric heroes scandinavian vikingsin this need they are all alike it was the noble races which left behind the concept of the barbarian in all their tracks wherever they went a consciousness of and a pride in this fact reveals itself even in their highest culture for example when pericles says to his athenians in that famous funeral speech our audacity has broken a way through to every land and sea putting up permanent memorials to itself for good and illthis audacity of the noble races mad absurd sudden in the way it expresses itself its unpredictability even the improbability of its undertakingspericles emphatically praises the rayhumia mental balance freedom from anxiety of the atheniansits indifference to and contempt for safety body life comfort its fearsome cheerfulness and the depth of its joy in all destruction in all the physical pleasures of victory and crueltyeverything summed up for those who suffer from such audacity in the image of the barbarian the evil enemy something like the goth or the vandal the deep icy mistrust which the german evokes as soon as he comes to powereven todayis still an aftereffect of that unforgettable terror with which for centuries europe confronted the rage of the blond german beast although there is hardly any idea linking the old germanic tribes and we germans let alone any blood relationship once before i have remarked on hesiods dilemma when he thought up his sequence of cultural periods and sought to express them as gold silver and iron but he didnt know what to do with the contradiction presented to him by the marvelous but at the same time horrifying and violent world of homer other than to make two cultural ages out of one and then place one after the otherfirst the age of heroes and demigods from troy and thebes just as that world remained as a memorial for the noble races who had their own ancestors in it and then the iron age as that same world appeared to the descendants of the downtrodden exploited ill treated those carried off and solda metallic age as mentioned hard cold cruel empty of feeling and scruples with everything crushed and covered over in blood assuming as true what in any event is taken as the truth nowadays that it is precisely the purpose of all culture to breed a tame and civilized animal a domestic pet out of the beast of prey man then we would undoubtedly have to consider the essential instruments of culture all those instinctive reactions and resentments by means of which the noble races with all their ideals were finally disgraced and overpoweredbut that would not be to claim that the bearers of these instincts also in themselves represented culture it would much rather be the case that the opposite is not only probableno nowadays it is visibly apparent these people carrying instincts for oppression and a lust for revenge the descendants of all european and noneuropean slavery and all prearyan populations in particular represent the regression of mankind these instruments of culture are a disgrace to humanity more a reason to be suspicious of or a counterargument against culture in general we may well be right when we hang onto our fear of the blond beast at the base of all noble races and keep up our guard but who would not find it a hundred times better to fear if he could at the same time be allowed to admire rather than not fear and no longer be able to rid himself of the disgusting sight of the failures the stunted the emaciated the poisoned is not that our fate today what is it that constitutes our aversion to man for we suffer from mantheres no doubt of that its not a matter of fear rather its the fact that we have nothing more to fear from men that the maggot man is in the foreground swarming around that the tame man the hopelessly mediocre and unpleasant man has already learned to feel that he is the goal the pinnacle the meaning of history the higher manyes indeed he even has a certain right to feel that about himself insofar as he feels separate from the excess of failed sick tired spent people who are nowadays beginning to make europe stink and feels at least somewhat successful at least still capable of life at least able to say yes to life at this point i wont suppress a sigh and a final hope what is it exactly that i find so totally unbearable something which i cannot deal with on my own which makes me choke and feel faint bad air bad air its when something which has failed comes close to me when i have to smell the entrails of a failed soul apart from that what can we not endure by way of need deprivation bad weather infirmity hardship loneliness basically we can deal with all the other things born as we are to an underground and struggling existence we come back again and again into the light we live over and over our golden hour of victoryand then we stand there just as we were born unbreakable tense ready for something new for something even more difficult more distant like a bow which all trouble only serves always to pull tighter but if there are heavenly goddesses who are our patrons beyond good and evil then from time to time grant me a glimpse grant me a single glimpse into something perfect something completely developed something happy powerful triumphant from which there is still something to fear a glimpse of a man who justifies humanity of a complementary and redeeming strokeofluck of a man for whose sake we can hang onto a faith in humanity for matters stand like this the diminution and levelling of european man hides our greatest danger for the sight of him makes us tired we see nothing today which wants to be greater we suspect that things are constantly going down and down into something thinner more goodnatured more prudent more comfortable more mediocre more indifferent more chinese more christianhumanity there is no doubt is becoming constantly better europes fate lies right here with our fear of mankind we also have lost our love for mankind our reverence for mankind our hopes for mankind even our will to be mankind a glimpse at man nowadays makes us tiredwhat is todays nihilism if it is not that we are weary of man but lets go back the problem with the other origin of the good of the good man as the person of resentment has imagined it for himself demands some conclusion that lambs are annoyed at the great predatory birds is not a strange thing and the fact that they snatch away small lambs provides no reason for holding anything against these large birds of prey and if the lambs say among themselves these predatory birds are eviland whoever is least like a predatory birdand especially anyone who is like its opposite a lambshouldnt that animal be good there is nothing to find fault with in this setting up of an ideal except for the fact that the birds of prey might look down with a little mockery and perhaps say to themselves we are not at all annoyed with these good lambswe even love them nothing is tastier than a tender lamb to demand that strength does not express itself as strength that it must not consist of a will to overpower a will to throw down a will to rule a thirst for enemies and opposition and triumphthat is as unreasonable as to demand that weakness express itself as strength a quantum of force is just such a quantum of drive will actionindeed it is nothing but these drives willing and actions in themselvesand it cannot appear as anything else except through the seduction of language and the fundamental errors of reason petrified in it which understands and misunderstands all action as conditioned by something which causes actions by a subject in fact in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an action as the effect of a subject which is called lightning so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of that strength as if behind the strong person there is an indifferent substrate which is free to manifest strength or not but there is no such substrate there is no being behind the doing acting becoming the doer is merely invented after the factthe act is everything people basically duplicate the event when they see lightning well that is an action of an action they set up the same event first as the cause and then again as its effect natural scientists are no better when they say force moves force causes and so onour entire scientific knowledge for all its coolness its freedom from feelings still remains exposed to the seductions of language and has not gotten rid of the changelings foisted on it the subject the atom for example is such a changeling like the kantian thing in itself its no wonder that the repressed secretly smouldering feelings of rage and hate use this belief for themselves and in fact even maintain a faith in nothing more strongly than in the idea that the strong are free to be weak and predatory birds are free to be lambsand in so doing they arrogate to themselves the right to blame the birds of prey for being birds of prey when the oppressed the downtrodden the conquered say to each other with the vengeful cunning of the powerless let us be different from evil people namely good and that man is good who does not overpower who hurts no one who does not attack who does not retaliate who hands revenge over to god who keeps himself hidden as we do who avoids all evil and demands little from life in generallike us the patient humble and uprightwhat that amounts to coolly expressed and without bias is essentially nothing more than we weak people are merely weak its good if we do nothing because we are not strong enough but this bitter state this shrewdness of the lowest ranks which even insects possess when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do too much has thanks to the counterfeiting and selfdeception of powerlessness dressed itself in the splendour of a selfdenying still patient virtue just as if the weakness of the weak man himselfthat means his essence his actions his entire single inevitable and irredeemable realityis a voluntary achievement something willed chosen an act something of merit this kind of man needs to believe in the disinterested freely choosing subject out of his instinct for selfpreservation selfapproval in which every falsehood is habitually sanctified the subject or to use a more popular style the soul has up to now probably been the best principle for belief on earth because for the majority of the dying the weak and the downtrodden of all sorts it makes possible that sublime selfdeception which establishes weakness itself as freedom and their being like this or that as something meritorious is there anyone who would like to take a little look down on and under that secret how man fabricates an ideal on earth who has the courage for that come on now here is an open glimpse into this dark workshop just wait a moment my dear mr presumptuous and nosy your eye must first get used to this artificial flickering light so enough now speak whats going on down there speak up say what you see man of the most dangerous curiositynow im the one whos listening i see nothing but i hear all the more it is a careful and crafty light rumourmongering and whispering from every nook and cranny it seem to me that people are lying a sugary mildness clings to every sound weakness is going to be falsified into something of merit theres no doubt about itthings are just as you said they were keep talking and powerlessness which does not retaliate is being falsified into goodness anxious baseness into humility submission before those one hates to obedience of course obedience to the one who they say commands this submissionthey call him god the inoffensiveness of the weak man even cowardice in which he is rich his standing at the door his inevitable need to wait aroundhere these acquire good names like patience and are called virtue that incapacity for revenge is called the lack of desire for revenge perhaps even forgiveness for they know not what they doonly we know what they do and people are talking about love for ones enemyand sweating as they say it keep talking they are miserabletheres no doubt about thatall these rumour mongers and counterfeiters in the corners although crouched down beside each other in the warmthbut they are telling me that their misery is gods choice his sign one beats the dog one loves the most perhaps this misery may be a preparation a test an education perhaps it is even moresomething that will one day be rewarded and paid out with huge interest in gold no in happiness they call that blessedness go on now they are letting me know that they are not only better than the powerful the masters of the earth whose spit they have to lick not out of fear certainly not out of fear but because god commands that they honour those in authoritythey are not only better than these but they also are better off or at any rate will one day have it better but enough enough i cant endure it any more bad air bad air this workshop where man fabricates idealsit seems to me it stinks from nothing but lies no just wait one minute more so far you havent said anything about the masterpiece of these black magicians who know how to make whiteness milk and innocence out of every blackness have you not noticed the perfection of their sophistication their most daring refined most spiritual most fallacious artistic attempt pay attention these cellar animals full of vengeance and hatredwhat are they making right now out of that vengeance and hatred have you ever heard these words if you heard only their words would you suspect that you were completely among men of resentment i understand once again ill open my ears oh oh oh and hold my nose now im hearing for the first time what theyve been saying so often we good menwe are the righteouswhat they demand they dont call repayment but the triumph of righteousness what they hate is not their enemy no they hate injustice godlessness what they believe and hope is not a hope for revenge the intoxication of sweet vengeance something homer called sweeter than honey but the victory of god the righteous god over the godless what remains for them to love on earth are not their brothers in hatred but their brothers in love as they say all the good and righteous people on the earth and what do they call what serves them as a consolation for all the suffering of lifetheir phantasmagoria of future blessedness which they are expecting what that am i hearing correctly they call that the last judgment the coming of their kingdom the coming of gods kingdombut in the meanwhile they live in faith in love in hope enough enough belief in what love for what hope for what theres no doubt that these weak people at some time or another also want to be the strong people some day their kingdom is supposed to arrivethey call it simply the kingdom of god as i mentioned people are indeed so humble about everything but to experience that one has to live a long time beyond deathin fact people must have an eternal life so they can win eternal recompense in the kingdom of god for this earthly life in faith in love in hope recompense for what recompense through what in my view dante was grossly in error when with an ingenuity meant to inspire terror he set that inscription over the gateway into his hell eternal love also created me over the gateway into the christian paradise and its eternal blessedness it would in any event be more fitting to set the inscription eternal hate also created meprovided its all right to set a truth over the gateway to a lie for what is the bliss of this paradise we might well have guessed that already but it is better for it to be expressly described for us by an authority we cannot underestimate thomas aquinas the great teacher and saint beati in regno coelesti he says as gently as a lamb videbunt poenas damnatorum ut beatitudo illis magis complaceat in the kingdom of heaven the blessed will see the punishment of the damned so that they will derive all the more pleasure from their heavenly bliss or do you want to hear that message in a stronger tone something from the mouth of a triumphant father of the church tertullian who warns his christians against the cruel sensuality of the public spectacles but why faith offers much more to us he says in de spectaculis c ss something much stronger thanks to the redemption very different joys are ours to command in place of the athletes we have our martyrs if we want blood well we have the blood of christ but think of what awaits us on the day of his coming again his triumphand now he takes off the rapturous visionary at enim supersunt alia spectacula ille ultimus et perpetuus judicii dies ille nationibus insperatus ille derisus cum tanta saeculi vetustas et tot ejus nativitates uno igne haurientur quae tunc spectaculi latitudo quid admirer quid rideam ubi gaudeam ubi exultem spectans tot et tantos reges qui in coelum recepti nuntiabantur cum ipso jove et ipsis suis testibus in imis tenebris congemescentes item praesides the provincial governors persecutores dominici nominis saevioribus quam ipsi flammis saevierunt insultantibus contra christianos liquescentes quos praeterea sapientes illos philosophos coram discipulis suis una conflagrantibus erubescentes quibus nihil ad deum pertinere suadebant quibus animas aut nullas aut non in pristine corpora redituras affirmabant etiam pots non ad rhadamanti nec ad minois sed ad inopinati christi tribunal palpitantes tunc magis tragoedi audiendi magis scilicet vocales better voices since they will be screaming in greater terror in sua propria calamitate tunc histriones cognoscendi solutiores multo per ignem tunc spectandus auriga in flammea rota totus rubens tunc xystici contemplandi non in gymnasiis sed in igne jaculati nisi quod ne tunc quidem illos velim vivos ut qui malim ad eos potius conspectum insatiabilem conferre qui in dominum desaevierung hic est ille dicam fabri aut quaestuariae filis in everything that follows and especially in the wellknown description of the mother of jesus from the talamud tertullian from this point on is referring to the jews sabbati destructor samarites et daemonium habens hic est quem a juda redemistis hic est ille arundine et colaphis diverberatus sputamentis dedecoratus felle et aceto potatus hic est quem clam discentes subripuerunt ut resurrexisse dicatur vel hortulanus detraxit ne lactucae suae frequentia commeantium laederentur ut talia spectes ut talibus exultes quis tibi praetor aut consul aut quaestor aut sacerdos de sua liberalitate praestabit et tamen haec jam habemus quodammodo per fidem spiritu imaginante repraesentata ceterum qualia illa sunt quae nec oculus vidit nec auris audivit nec in cor hominis ascenderunt cor credo circo et utraque cavea first and fourth tier of seats or according to others the comic and tragic stages per fidem thats how its written however there are other spectaclesthat last eternal day of judgment ignored by nations derided by them when the accumulation of the years and all the many things which they produced will be burned in a single fire what a broad spectacle then appears how i will be lost in admiration how i will laugh how i will rejoice i will be full of exaltation then as i see so many great kings who by public report were accepted into heaven groaning in the deepest darkness with jove himself and alongside those very men who testified on their behalf they will include governors of provinces who persecuted the name of our lord burning in flames more fierce that those with which they proudly raged against the christians and those wise philosophers who earlier convinced their disciples that god was irrelevant and who claimed either that there is no such thing as a soul or that our souls would not return to their original bodies will be ashamed as they burn in the conflagration with those very disciples and the poets will be there shaking with fear not in front of the tribunal of rhadamanthus or minos but of the christ they did not anticipate then it will be easier to hear the tragic actors because their voices will be more resonant in their own calamity better voices since they will be screaming in greater terror the actors will then be easier to recognize for the fire will make them much more agile then the charioteer will be on show all red in a wheel of fire and the athletes will be visible thrown not in the gymnasium but in the fire unless i have no wish to look at their bodies then so that i can more readily cast an insatiable gaze on those who raged against our lord this is the man i will say the son of a workman or a prostitute in everything that follows and especially in the wellknown description of the mother of jesus from the talamud tertullian from this point on is referring to the jews the destroyer of the sabbath the samaritan possessed by the devil he is the man whom you brought from judas the man who was beaten with a reed and with fists reviled with spit who was given gall and vinegar to drink he is the man whom his disciples took away in secret so that it could be said that he was resurrected or whom the gardener took away so that the crowd of visitors would not harm his lettuces what praetor or consul or quaestor or priest will from his own generosity grant you the sight of such things or the exultation in them and yet we already have these things to a certain extent through faith represented to us by the imagining spirit besides what sorts of things has the eye not seen or the ear not heard and what sorts of things have not arisen in the human heart cor i believe these are more pleasing than the race track and the circus and both enclosures first and fourth tier of seats or according to others the comic and tragic stages through faith thats how its written lets bring this to a conclusion the two opposing values good and bad good and evil have fought a fearful battle on earth for thousands of years if its true that the second value in each pair has for a long time had the upper hand theres still no lack of places where the battle goes on without a final decision we ourselves could say that in the intervening time the battle has been constantly drawn to greater heights and even greater depths and has become continuously more spiritual so that nowadays there is perhaps no more decisive mark of a higher nature a more spiritual nature than that it is split in this sense and is truly a battleground for these opposites the symbol of this battle written in a script which has remained legible through all human history up to the present is called rome against judea judea against rome to this point there has been no greater event than this war this posing of a question the contradiction between these deadly enemies rome felt that the jews were something contrary to nature itself something like its monstrous polar opposite in rome the jew was considered guilty of hatred against the entire human race and that view was correct to the extent we are right to link the health and the future of the human race to the unconditional rule of aristocratic values the roman values by contrast how did the jews feel about rome we can guess that from a thousand signs but it is sufficient to treat oneself again to the apocalypse of john that wildest of all written outbursts which vengeance has on its conscience incidentally we must not underestimate the deep consistency of the christian instinct when it ascribed this very book of hate to the name of the disciple of love the same man to whom it attributed that wildly enthusiastic amorous gospelthere is some truth to this no matter how much literary counterfeiting may have been necessary for that book to make the point the romans were indeed strong and noble men stronger and nobler than any people who had lived on earth up until thenor even than any people who had ever been dreamed up everything they left as remains every inscription is delightful provided that we can guess what was doing the writing there by contrast the jews were par excellence that priestly people of resentment who possessed an unparalleled genius for popular morality just compare people with related talentssay the chinese or the germanswith the jews in order to understand who is ranked first and who is ranked fifth which of them has proved victorious for the time being rome or judea surely theres not the slightest doubt just think of who it is people bow down to today in rome as the personification of all the highest valuesand not only in rome but in almost half the earth all the places where people have become merely tame or want to become tamein front of three jews as we know and one jewess in front of jesus of nazareth the fisherman peter the carpet worker paul and the mother of the firstmentioned jesus named mary now this is very remarkable without doubt rome has been conquered its true that in the renaissance there was a brilliant incredible reawakening of the classical ideal the noble way of evaluating everything rome itself behaved like someone who had woken up from a coma induced by the pressure of the new jewish rome built over it which looked like an ecumenical synagogue and was called the church but immediately judea triumphed again thanks to that basically vulgar german and english movement of resentment which we call the reformation together with what had to follow as a consequence the reestablishment of the church as well as the reestablishment of the old gravelike tranquillity of classical rome in what is an even more decisive and deeper sense judea once again was victorious over the classical ideal at the time of the french revolution the last political nobility which we had in europe in seventeenth and eighteenth century france broke apart under the instincts of popular resentmentnever on earth has there been heard a greater rejoicing a noisier enthusiasm its true that in the midst of all this the most dreadful and most unexpected events took place the old ideal itself stepped physically and with unheardof splendour before the eyes and the conscience of humanityand once again stronger simpler and more urgently than ever rang out in opposition to the old lie to the slogan of resentment about the privileged rights of the majority in opposition to that will for a low condition abasement equality for the decline and extinguishing of mankindin opposition to all that there rang out a fearsome and delightful counterslogan about the privileged rights of the few as a last signpost to a different road napoleon appeared the most singular and lateborn man there ever was and in him the problem of the inherently noble ideal was made flesh we might well think about what sort of a problem that is napoleon this synthesis of the inhuman and the superhuman did that end it was that greatest of all opposition of ideals thus set ad acta aside for all time or was it merely postponed postponed indefinitely some day after a much longer preparation will an even more fearful blaze from the old fire not have to take place more than that isnt this exactly something we should hope for with all our strengtheven will it or demand it anyone who like my readers begins to reflect on these points and to think further will have difficulty coming to a quick conclusionreason enough for me to come to a conclusion myself provided that it has been crystal clear for a long time what i want precisely what i want with that dangerous slogan which is written on the body of my last book beyond good and evil at least this does not mean beyond good and bad note im taking the opportunity provided to me by this essay publicly and formally to state a desire which i have expressed up to now only in occasional conversations with scholars namely that some philosophical faculty might set up a series of awardwinning academic essays in order to serve the advancement of studies into the history of morality perhaps this book will serve to provide a forceful push in precisely such a direction bearing in mind a possibility of this sort let me suggest the following questionit merits the attention of philologists and historians as much as of professional philosophical scholars what indications does the scientific study of language especially etymological research provide for the history of the development of moral concepts on the other hand it is of course just as necessary to attract the participation of physiologists and doctors in this problem of the value of all methods of evaluating up to now that task might be left to the faculties of philosophers and in this single matter they could become advocates and mediators after they have completely succeeded in converting the relationship between philosophy physiology and medicine originally so aloof so mistrusting into the most friendly and fruitful exchange in fact all the tables of value all the you shoulds which history or ethnology knows about need first and foremost illumination and interpretation from physiology rather than from psychology and all of them similarly await a critique from the point of view of medical science the question what is this or that table of values and morality worth will be set under the different perspectives for we cannot analyze the question value for what too finely something for example that has an apparent value with respect to the longest possible capacity for survival of a race or for an increase in its power to adapt to a certain climate or for the preservation of the greatest number would have nothing like the same value if the issue is one of developing a stronger type the wellbeing of the majority and the wellbeing of the fewest are opposing viewpoints for values we will leave it to the navet of english biologists to take the first as the one of inherently higher value all the sciences from now on have to advance the future work of the philosopher understanding that the philosopher has to solve the problem of value that he has to determine the rank order of values second essay guilt bad conscience and related matters to breed an animal that is entitled to make promisessurely that is the essence of the paradoxical task nature has set itself where human beings are concerned isnt that the real problem of human beings the fact that this problem has largely been resolved must seem all the more astonishing to a person who knows how to appreciate fully the power which works against this promisemaking namely forgetfulness forgetfulness is not merely a vis interiae a force of inertia as superficial people think is it much rather an active capability to repress something positive in the strongest sense we can ascribe to forgetfulness the fact what while we are digesting what we alone live through and experience and absorb we might call the process mental ingestion einverseelung we are conscious of what is going on as little as we are with the thousandfold process which our bodily nourishment goes through socalled physical ingestion einverleibung the doors and windows of consciousness are shut from time to time so that it stays undisturbed by the noise and struggle with which the underworld of our functional organs keeps working for and against one anothera small quiet place a little tabula rasa blank slate of the consciousness so that there will again be room for something new above all for the nobler functions and officials for ruling thinking ahead determining what to do for our organism is arranged as an oligarchythat is as i said the use of active forgetfulness like some porter at the door a maintainer of psychic order quiet and etiquette from that we can see at once how if forgetfulness were not present there could be no happiness no cheerfulness no hoping no pride no present the man in whom this repression apparatus is harmed and not working properly we can compare to a dyspeptic and not just comparehe is finished with nothing now this necessarily forgetful animal in which forgetfulness is present as a force as a form of strong health has had an opposing capability bred into it a memory with the help of which in certain cases its forgetfulness will cease to functionthat is for those cases where promises are to be made this is in no way a merely passive inability ever to be rid of an impression once it has been etched into the mind nor is it merely indigestion over a word one has pledged at a particular time and which one can no longer be over and done with no its an active wish not to be free of the matter a continuing desire for what one willed at a particular time a real memory of ones will so that between the original i will or i will do and the actual discharge of the will its real action without thinking about it a world of strange new things circumstances even acts of the will can intervene without breaking this long chain of the will but consider what that presupposes in order to organize the future in this manner human beings must have first learned to separate necessary events from chance events to think in terms of cause and effect to see distant events as if they were present to anticipate them to set goals and the means to reach them safely to develop a capability for figures and calculations in generaland for that to occur a human being must necessarily have first become something one could predict something bound by regular rules even in the way he imagined himself to himself so that finally he is able to act like someone who makes promiseshe can make himself into a pledge for the future precisely that development is the long history of the origin of responsibility the task of breeding an animal with a right to make promises contains within it as we have already grasped as a condition and prerequisite the earlier task of first making a human being necessarily uniform to some extent one among many others like him regular and consequently predictable the immense task involved in this what i have called the morality of custom cf daybreak p the essential work of a man on his own self in the longestlasting age of the human race his entire prehistorical work derives its meaning its grand justification from the following point no matter how much hardship tyranny monotony and idiocy it also manifested with the help of the morality of custom and the social strait jacket the human being was rendered truly predictable now lets position ourselves by contrast at the end of this immense process in the place where the tree finally yields its fruit where society and the morality of custom finally bring to light the end for which they were simply the means we findas the ripest fruit on that treethe sovereign individual something which resembles only itself which has broken loose again from the morality of customthe autonomous individual beyond morality for autonomous and moral are mutually exclusive termsin short the human being who possesses his own independent and enduring will who is entitled to make promisesand in him a proud consciousness quivering in every muscle of what has finally been achieved and given living embodiment in him a real consciousness of power and freedom a feeling of completion for human beings generally this man who has become free who really has the right to make promises this master of free will this sovereignhow can he not realize the superiority he enjoys over everyone who does not have the right to make a promise and make pledges on his own behalf knowing how much trust how much fear and how much respect he creates he is worthy of all three and how with this mastery over himself he has necessarily been given in addition mastery over his circumstances over nature and over all creatures with a shorter and less reliable will the free man the owner of an enduring unbreakable will by possessing this also acquires his own standard of value he looks out from himself at others and confers respect or withholds it and just as it will be necessary for him to honour those like him the strong and dependable who are entitled to make promises in other words everyone who makes promises like a sovereign seriously rarely and slowly who is sparing with his trust who honours another when he does trust who gives his word as something reliable because he knows he is strong enough to remain upright when opposed by misfortune even when opposed by fate so it will be necessary for him to keep his foot ready to kick the scrawny unreliable men who make promises without being entitled to and to hold his cane ready to punish the liar who breaks his word in the very moment it comes out of his mouth the proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of responsibility the consciousness of this rare freedom this power over oneself and destiny have become internalized into the deepest parts of him and grown instinctual have now become a dominating instinct what will he call it this dominating instinct given that he finds he needs a word for it theres no doubt about this question the sovereign man calls this instinct his conscience his conscience to begin with we can conjecture that the idea of conscience which we are encountering here in its highest almost perplexing form already has a long history and developmental process behind it to be entitled to pledge ones word to do it with pride and also to say yes to oneselfthat right is a ripe fruit as i have mentioned but it is also a late fruit for what a long stretch of time this fruit must have hung tart and sour on the tree and for an even longer time it was impossible to see any such fruit it would appear that no one would have been entitled to make promises even if everything about the tree was getting ready for it and was growing in that very direction how does one create a memory for the human animal how does one stamp something like that into his partly dull partly flickering momentary understanding this living embodiment of forgetfulness so that it stays there this ancient problem as you can imagine was not resolved right away with tender answers and methods there is perhaps nothing more fearful and more terrible in the entire prehistory of human beings than the technique for developing his memory we burn something in so that it remains in the memory only something which never ceases to cause pain stays in the memorythat is a leading principle of the most ancient and unfortunately the most recent psychology on earth we might even say that everywhere on earth nowadays where there is still solemnity seriousness mystery and gloomy colours in the lives of men and people something of that terror is still at work the fear with which in earlier times on earth people made promises pledged their word or praised something the past the longest deepest most severe past breathes on us and surfaces in us when we become solemn when the human being considered it necessary to make a memory for himself it never happened without blood martyrs and sacrificesthe most terrible sacrifices and pledges among them the sacrifice of the first born the most repulsive selfmutilations for example castration the cruellest forms of ritual in all the religious cults and all religions are at bottom systems of crueltyall that originates in that instinct which discovered that pain was the most powerful means of helping to develop the memory in a certain sense all asceticism belongs here a couple of ideas need to be made indissoluble omnipresent unforgettable fixed in order to hypnotize the entire nervous and intellectual system through these fixed ideasand the ascetic procedures and forms of life are the means whereby these ideas are freed from jostling around with all the other ideas in order to make them unforgettable the worse the human beings memory was the more terrible his customs have always appeared the harshness of the laws of punishment provide a special standard for measuring how much trouble people went to in order to triumph over forgetfulness and to maintain a present awareness of a few primitive demands of social living together for this slave of momentary feelings and desires we germans certainly do not think of ourselves as a particularly cruel and hardhearted people even less as particularly careless people who live only in the present but have a look at our old penal code in order to understand how much trouble it took on this earth to breed a people of thinkers by that i mean the peoples of europe among whom today we still find a maximum of trust seriousness tastelessness and practicality and who with these characteristics have a right to breed all sorts of european mandarins these germans have used terrible means to make themselves a memory in order to attain mastery over their vulgar and brutally crude basic instincts think of the old german punishments for example stoning the legend even lets the mill stone fall on the head of the guilty person breaking on the wheel the unique invention and specialty of the german genius in the area of punishment impaling on a stake ripping people apart or stamping them to death with horses quartering boiling the criminal in oil or wine still done in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the wellloved practice of flaying cutting flesh off in strips carving flesh out of the chest along with of course covering the offender with honey and leaving him to the flies in the burning sun with the help of such images and procedures people finally retained five or six i will nots in their memory and so far as these precepts were concerned they gave their word in order to live with the advantages of societyand that was that with the assistance of this sort of memory people finally came to reason ah reason seriousness mastery over emotions the whole gloomy business called reflection all these privileges and ceremonies of human beingshow expensive they were how much blood and horror is the basis for all good things but then how did that other gloomy business the consciousness of guilt the whole bad conscience come into the world with this we turn back to our genealogists of morality ill say it once moreor perhaps i havent said it at all yetthey are useless with their own purely modern experience extending only through five periods with no knowledge of or any desire to know the past and even less historical insight a second perspectivesomething so necessary at this pointthey nonetheless pursue the history of morality that must inevitably produce results which have a less than tenuous relationship to the truth have these genealogists of morality up to this point allowed themselves to dream even remotely that for instance the major moral principle guilt schuld derives its origin from the very materialistic idea debt schulden or that punishment developed entirely as repayment without reference to any assumption about the freedom or lack of freedom of the willand did so to the point where it first required a high degree of human development so that the animal man began to make those much more primitive distinctions between intentional negligent accidental responsible and their opposites and bring them to bear when meting out punishment that unavoidable idea nowadays so trite and apparently natural which has really had to serve as the explanation how the feeling of justice in general came into existence on earththe criminal deserves punishment because he could have acted otherwisethis idea in fact is an extremely late achievement indeed a sophisticated form of human judgment and decision making anyone who moves this idea back to the very beginnings is sticking his coarse fingers inappropriately into the psychology of primitive humanity for the most extensive period of human history punishment was certainly not meted out because people held the instigator of evil responsible for his actions nor was it assumed that only the guilty party should be punished it was much more the case as it still is now when parents punish their children of anger over some harm which people have suffered anger vented on the perpetrator but this anger was restrained and modified through the idea that every injury had some equivalent and that compensation for it could in fact be paid out even if that was through the pain of the perpetrator where did this primitive deeply rooted and perhaps by now ineradicable idea derive its power the idea of an equivalence between punishment and pain i have already given away the answer in the contractual relationship between creditor and debtor which is as ancient as the idea of someone subject to law and which in itself refers back to the basic forms of buying selling bartering trading and exchanging goods its true that recalling this contractual relationship arouses as we might expect from what i have observed above all sorts of suspicion of and opposition to primitive humanity which established or allowed it its precisely at this point that people make promises here the pertinent issue is that the person who makes a promise has to have a memory created for him so that precisely at this point we can surmise there exists a site where we find harshness cruelty and pain in order to inspire trust in his promise to pay back in order to give his promise a guarantee of its seriousness and sanctity in order to impress on his own conscience the idea of paying back as a duty an obligation the debtor by virtue of the contract pledges to the creditor in the event that he does not pay something that he still owns something over which he still exercises power for example his body or his wife or his freedom or even his life or under certain religious conditions even his blessedness the salvation of his soul or finally his peace in the grave as was the case in egypt where the dead body of the debtor even in the tomb found no peace from the creditorand its certain that with the egyptians such peace was particularly important that means that the creditor could inflict all kinds of ignominy and torture on the body of the debtorfor instance slicing off the body as much as seemed appropriate for the size of the debt and this point of view early on and everywhere gave rise to precise sometimes horrific estimates going into finer and finer details legally established estimates about individual limbs and body parts i consider it already a step forward as evidence of a freer conception of the law something which calculates more grandly a more roman idea of justice when romes twelve tables of laws decreed it was all the same no matter how much or how little the creditor cut off in such cases si plus minusve secuerunt ne fraude esto let it not be thought a crime if they cut off more or less let us clarify the logic of this whole method of compensationit is weird enough the equivalency is given in this way instead of an advantage making up directly for the harm hence instead of compensation in gold land possessions of some sort or another the creditor is given a kind of pleasure as repayment and compensationthe pleasure of being allowed to discharge his power on a powerless person without having to think about it the delight in de fair le mal pour le plaisir de le faire doing wrong for the pleasure of doing it the enjoyment of violation this enjoyment is more highly prized the lower and baser the debtor stands in the social order and it can easily seem to the creditor a delicious mouthful even a foretaste of a higher rank by means of the punishment of the debtor the creditor participates in a right belonging to the masters finally he himself for once comes to the lofty feeling of despising a being as someone below him as someone he is entitled to mistreator at least in the event that the real force of punishment of inflicting punishment has already been transferred to the authorities the feeling of seeing the debtor despised and mistreated the compensation thus consist of a permission for and right to cruelty in this area that is in the laws of obligation the world of the moral concepts guilt conscience and sanctity of obligations originated its beginnings just like the beginnings of everything great on earth were watered thoroughly and for a long time with blood and can we not add that this world deep down has never again been completely free of a certain smell of blood and torturenot even with old kant whose categorical imperative stinks of cruelty in addition here the weird knot linking the ideas of guilt and suffering which perhaps has become impossible to undo was first knit together let me pose the question once more to what extent can suffering be a compensation for debts to the extent that making someone suffer provides the highest degree of pleasure to the extent that the person hurt by the debt in exchange for the injury and for the distress caused by the injury got an extraordinary offsetting pleasuremaking someone suffera real celebration something that as ive said was valued all the more the greater the difference between him and the rank and social position of the creditor i have been speculating here for its difficult to see such subterranean things from the surface quite apart from the fact that its an embarrassing subject anyone who crudely throws into the middle of all this the idea of revenge has merely buried and dimmed his insights rather than illuminated them revenge itself takes us back to the very same problem how can making someone suffer give us a feeling of satisfaction it seems to me that the delicacy and even more the hypocrisy of tame house pets i mean modern man i mean us resist a really powerful understanding of just how much cruelty contributes to the great celebratory joy of primitive humanity as an ingredient mixed into almost all their enjoyments and from another perspective how nave and innocent their need for cruelty appears how they basically accept disinterested malice or to use spinozas words the sympathia malevolens malevolent sympathy as a normal human characteristic and hence as something to which their conscience says a heartfelt yes a more deeply penetrating eye might still notice even today enough of this most ancient and most basic celebratory human joy in beyond good and evil p ff even earlier in daybreak p i pointed a cautious finger at the constantly growing spiritualization and deification of cruelty which runs through the entire history of higher culture and in a significant sense even constitutes that culture in any case its not so long ago that people wouldnt think of an aristocratic wedding and folk festival in a grandest style without executions tortures or something like an autodaf burning at the stake and similarly no noble household lacked creatures on whom people could vent their malice and cruel taunts without a second thought remember don quixote at the court of the duchess today we read all of don quixote with a bitter taste on the tongueits almost an ordeal in so doing we become very foreign very obscure to the author and his contemporaries they read it with a fully clear conscience as the most cheerful of books they almost died laughing at it watching suffering is good for people making someone suffer is even betterthat is a harsh principle but an old powerful and human alltoohuman major principle which by the way even the apes might agree with for people say that in thinking up bizarre cruelties the apes already anticipate a great many human actions and as it were act them out without cruelty there is no celebration thats what the oldest and longest era of human history teaches usand with punishment too there is so much celebration with these ideas by the way i have no desire whatsoever to give our pessimists grist for their discordant mills grating with the weariness of life on the contrary i want to state very clearly that in that period when human beings had not yet become ashamed of their cruelty life on earth was happier than it is today now that we have our pessimists the darkening of heaven over mens heads has always increased quickly in proportion to the growth of human beings shame at human beings the tired pessimistic look the mistrust of the riddle of life the icy denial stemming from disgust with lifethese are not the signs of the wickedest eras in the history of human beings its more the case that they first come to light as the swamp plants they are when the swamp to which they belong is therei mean the sickly mollycoddling and moralizing thanks to which the animal man finally learns to feel shame about all his instincts on his way to becoming an angel not to use a harsher word here man developed an upset stomach and a furry tongue which made him not only fight against the joy and innocence of the animal but even lose his taste for life so that now and then he stands there holds his nose and with pope innocent iii disapproves of himself and makes a catalogue of his nastiness conceived in filth disgustingly nourished in his mothers body developed out of evil material stuff stinking horribly a secretion of spit urine and excrement now when suffering always has to march out as the first argument against existence as its most serious question mark its good for us to remember the times when people judged things the other way around because they couldnt do without making people suffer and saw a firstclass magic in it a really tempting enticement for living perhaps and let me say this as a consolation for the delicate at that time pain didnt hurt as much as it does nowadays at least that could be the conclusion of a doctor who had treated a negro taking the latter as a representative of prehistorical man for a bad case of inner inflammation which drives the european with the best constitution almost to despair but which doesnt have the same effect on the negro the graph of the human sensitivity to pain seems in fact to sink down remarkably and almost immediately after the first ten thousand or ten million of the top members of the higher culture and i personally have no doubt that in comparison with one painful night of a single hysterical welleducated female the total suffering of all animals which up to now have been interrogated by the knife for scientific purposes is really insignificant perhaps it is even permissible to concede the possibility that the pleasure in cruelty does not really need to die out since today pain does more harm the relevant pleasure needed only to be sublimated and made more subtlein other words it had to appear translated into the imaginative and spiritual and embellished with nothing but names so unobjectionable that they arouse no suspicion in even the most delicate hypocritical conscience tragic pity is one such name another is les nostalgies de la croix nostalgia for the cross what really enrages people about suffering is not the suffering itself but the meaninglessness of suffering but neither for the christian who sees in suffering an entire secret machinery for salvation nor for the nave men of older times who understood how to interpret all suffering in relation to the spectator or to the person inflicting the suffering was there generally any such meaningless suffering in order for the hidden undiscovered unwitnessed suffering to be removed from the world and for people to be able to deny it honestly they were then almost compelled to invent gods and intermediate beings at all levels high and lowbriefly put something that also roamed in hidden places that also looked into the darkness and that would not readily permit an interesting painful spectacle to escape its attention hence with the help of such inventions life then understood and has always understood how to justify itself by a trick how to justify its evil nowadays perhaps it requires other helpful inventions for example life as riddle life as a problem of knowledge every evil which is uplifting in the eyes of a god is justified thats how the prehistorical logic of feeling rang outand was that really confined to prehistory the gods conceived of as friends of cruel spectacleoh how far this primitive idea still rises up in our european humanity we might well seek advice from calvin and luther on this point at any rate it is certain that even the greeks knew of no more acceptable snack to offer their gods to make them happy than the joys of cruelty with what sort of expression do you think did homer allow his gods to look down on the fate of men what final sense was there essentially in the trojan war and similar frightful tragedies we cannot entertain the slightest doubts about this they were intended as celebrations for the godsand to the extent that the poet is in these matters more godlike than other men as festivals for the poets as well later the greek moral philosophers in the same way imagined the eyes of god looking down on the moral struggles on heroism and the selfmutilation of the virtuous the hercules of duty was on a stage and he knew he was there without someone watching virtue for this race of actors was something entirely inconceivable surely such a daring and fateful philosophical invention first made for europe at that time the invention of the free will of the absolutely spontaneous nature of human beings in matters of good and evil was created above all to justify the idea that the interest of gods in men and in human virtue could never run out on this earthly stage there was never to be any lack of really new things really unheard of suspense complication catastrophe a world conceived of as perfectly deterministic would have been predictable to the gods and therefore also soon boring for them that was reason enough for these friends of the gods the philosophers not to ascribe such a deterministic world to their gods all of ancient humanity is full of sensitive consideration for the spectator for a truly public truly visible world which did not know how to imagine happiness without dramatic performances and festivals and as i have already said in the great punishments there is also so much celebration to resume the path of our enquiry the feeling of guilt of personal obligation has as we saw its origin in the oldest and most primitive personal relationship there is and has beenin the relationship between seller and buyer creditor and debtor here for the first time one person encountered another person and measured himself against him we have not yet found a civilization at such a low level that something of this relationship is not already perceptible to set prices measure values think up equivalencies to exchange thingsthat preoccupied mans very first thinking to such a degree that in a certain sense its what thinking is the very oldest form of astuteness was bred herehere too we can assume are the first beginnings of human pride his feeling of preeminence in relation to other animals perhaps our word man mensch manas continues to express directly something of this feeling of the self the human being describes himself as a being which assesses values which values and measures as the inherently calculating animal selling and buying together with their psychological attributes are even older than the beginnings of any form of social organization and grouping it is much rather the case that out of the most rudimentary form of personal legal rights the budding feeling of exchange contract guilt law duty and compensation were first transferred to the crudest and earliest social structures in their relationships with similar social structures along with the habit of comparing power with power of measuring of calculating the eye was now at any rate adjusted to this perspective and with that awkward consistency characteristic of the thinking in ancient human beings hard to get started but then inexorably moving forward in the same direction people soon reached the great generalization everything has its price everything can be paid offthe oldest and most nave moral principle of justice the beginning of all good nature all fairness all good will all objectivity on earth justice at this first stage is good will among those approximately equal in power to come to terms with each other to understand each other again by compensationand in relation to those less powerful to compel them to arrive at some settlement among themselves still measuring by the standard of prehistory a prehistory which by the way is present at all times or is capable of returning the community also stands in relation to its members in that important basic relationship of the creditor to his debtors people live in a community they enjoy the advantages of a community and what fine advantages they are nowadays we sometimes underestimate themthey live protected cared for in peace and trust without worries concerning certain injuries and enmities from which the man outside the community the man without peace is excludeda german understands what misery elend or lend other country originally meantand how people pledged themselves to and entered into obligations with the community bearing in mind precisely these injuries and enmities what will happen with an exception to this case the community the defrauded creditor will see that it gets paid as well as it canon that people can rely the issue here is least of all the immediate damage which the offender has caused setting this to one side the lawbreaker verbrecher is above all a breaker brechera breaker of contracts and a breaker of his word against the totality with respect to all the good features and advantages of the communal life in which up to that point he has had a share the lawbreaker is a debtor who does not merely not pay back the benefits and advances given to him but who even attacks his creditor so from this point on not only does he lose as is reasonable all these good things and benefits but he is also more pertinently reminded what these good things are all about the anger of the injured creditor the community gives him back the wild condition as free as a bird from which he was earlier protected it pushes him away from it and now every form of hostility can vent itself on him at this stage of cultural behaviour punishment is simply the copy the mimus of the normal conduct towards the hated disarmed enemy who has been thrown down who has forfeited not only all legal rights and protection but also all mercyhence it is a case of the rights of war and the victory celebration of vae victis woe to the conquered in all its ruthlessness and cruelty which accounts for the fact that war itself including the warlike cult of sacrifice has given us all the ways in which punishment has appeared in history as it acquires more power a community considers the crimes of a single individual less serious because they no longer make him dangerous and unsettling for the existence of the community as much as they did before the wrong doer is no longer left without peace and thrown out and the common anger can no longer vent itself on him without restraint to the same extent it did before it is rather the case that the wrong doer from now on is carefully protected by the community against this anger particularly from that of the injured person and is taken into protective custody the compromise with the anger of those most immediately affected by the wrong doing and thus the effort to localize the case and to avert a wider or even a general participation and unrest the attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole business the compositio above all the desire appearing with everincreasing clarity to consider every crime as in some sense or other capable of being paid off and thus at least to some extent to separate the criminal and his crime from each otherthose are the characteristics stamped more and more clearly on the further development of criminal law if the power and the selfconfidence of a community keeps growing the criminal law grows constantly milder every weakening and profound jeopardizing of the community brings the harsher forms of criminal law to light once more the creditor always became proportionally more human as he became richer finally the amount of his wealth itself establishes how much damage he can sustain without suffering from it it would not be impossible to imagine a society with a consciousness of its own power which allowed itself the most privileged luxury which it can haveletting its criminals go free without punishment why should i really bother about my parasites it could then say may they live and prosperfor that i am still sufficiently strong justice which started by stating everything is capable of being paid for everything must be paid off ends at that point by covering its eyes and letting the person incapable of payment go freeit ends as every good thing on earth ends by doing away with itself this selfnegation of justicewe know what a beautiful name it calls itselfmercy it goes without saying that mercy remains the privilege of the most powerful man or even better his beyond the law now a critical word about a recently published attempt to find the origin of justice in quite a different placethat is in resentment but first let me speak a word in the ear of the psychologists provided that they have any desire to study resentment itself up close for once this plant grows most beautifully nowadays among anarchists and antisemitesin addition it blooms as it always has in hidden places like the violet although it has a different fragrance and since like always has to emerge from like it is not surprising to see attempts coming forward again from just such circles as they have already done many times before see above p first essay to sanctify revenge under the name of justice as if justice were basically simply a further development of a feeling of being injured and to bring belated respect to emotional reactions generally all of them using the idea of revenge with this last point i personally take the least offence it even seems to me a service so far as the entire biological problem is concerned in connection with which the worth of these emotions has been underestimated up to now the only thing im calling attention to is the fact that it is the very idea of resentment itself out of which this new emphasis on scientific fairness grows which favours hate envy resentment suspicion rancour and revenge this scientific fairness that is ceases immediately and gives way to tones of mortal enmity and prejudice as soon as it deals with another group of emotions which it strikes me have a much higher biological worth than those reactive ones and which therefore have earned the right to be scientifically assessed and given a high valuenamely the truly active emotions like desire for mastery acquisitiveness and so on e dhring the value of life a course in philosophy the whole book really so much against this tendency in general but in connection with dhrings single principle that we must seek the homeland of justice in the land of the reactive feeling we must for love of the truth rudely turn this around by setting out a different principle the last territory to be conquered by the spirit of justice is the land of the reactive emotions if it is truly the case that the just man remains just even towards someone who has injured him and not just cold moderate strange indifferent being just is always a positive attitude if under the sudden attack of personal injury ridicule and suspicion the gaze of the lofty clear deep and benevolent objectivity of the just and judging eye does not grow dark well thats a piece of perfection and the highest mastery on earth even something that it would be wise for people not to expect in any event they should not believe in it too easily its certainly true that on average even among the most just people even a small dose of hostility malice and insinuation is enough to make them see red and chase fairness out of their eyes the active aggressive overreaching human being is always placed a hundred steps closer to justice than the reactive person for him it is not even necessary in the slightest to estimate an object falsely and with bias the way the reactive man does and must do thus as a matter of fact at all times the aggressive human beingthe stronger braver more noble manhas always had on his side a better conscience as well as a more independent eye and by contrast we can already guess who generally has the invention of bad conscience on his consciencethe man of resentment finally lets look around in history up to now in what area has the whole implementation of law in general as well as the essential need for law been at home could it be in the area of the reactive human beings that is entirely wrong it is much more the case that its been at home with the active strong spontaneous and aggressive men historically considered the law on earthlet me say this to the annoyance of the abovementioned agitator who himself once made the confession the doctrine of revenge runs through all my work and efforts as the red thread of justicerepresents that very struggle against the reactive feelings the war with them on the part of active and aggressive powers which have partly used up their strength to put a halt to or restrain reactive pathos and to compel some settlement with it everywhere where justice is practised where justice is upheld we see a power stronger in relation to a weaker power standing beneath it whether with groups or individuals seeking ways to bring an end among the latter to the senseless rage of resentment partly by dragging the object of resentment out of the hands of revenge partly by setting in the place of revenge a battle against the enemies of peace and order partly by coming up with compensation proposing it under certain circumstances making it compulsory sometimes establishing certain equivalents for injuries as a norm which from now on resentment is channeled into once and for all the most decisive factor however which the highest power carries out and sets in place against the superior power of the feelings of hostility and animositysomething that power always does as soon as it is somehow strong enough to do itis to set up laws the imperative explanation of those things which in its own eyes are considered allowed and legal and things which are considered forbidden and illegal in the process after the establishment of the law the authorities treat attacks and arbitrary acts of individuals or entire groups as an outrage against the law as rebellion against the highest power itself and they steer the feelings of those beneath them away from the immediate damage caused by such outrages and thus in the long run achieve the reverse of what all revenge desires which sees only the viewpoint of the injured party and considers only that valid from now on the eye becomes trained to evaluate actions always impersonally even the eye of the harmed party itself although this would be the very last thing to occur as i have remarked earlier consequently only with the setting up of the law is there a just and unjust and not as dhring will have it from the time of the injurious action to talk of just and unjust in themselves has no sense whatsoeverits obvious that in themselves harming oppressing exploiting destroying cannot be unjust inasmuch as life essentially works that way that is in its basic functions it harms oppresses exploits and destroysand cannot be conceived at all without these characteristics we must acknowledge something even more alarmingthe fact that from the highest biological standpoint conditions of law must always be exceptional conditions partial restrictions on the basic will to live which is set on powerthey are subordinate to the total purpose of this will as its individual means that is as means to create a larger unit of power a legal system conceived of as sovereign and universal not as a means in the struggle of power complexes but as a means against all struggles in general something along the lines of dhrings communist clich in which each will must be considered as equal to every will that would be a principle hostile to life a destroyer and dissolver of human beings an assassination attempt on the future of human beings a sign of exhaustion a secret path to nothingness here one more word concerning the origin and purpose of punishmenttwo problems which are separate or should be separate unfortunately people normally throw them together into one how do the previous genealogists of morality deal with this issue naivelythe way they always work they find some purpose or other for punishment for example revenge or deterrence then in a simple way set this purpose at the beginning as the causa fiendi creative cause of punishment and then thats ittheyre finished the purpose in law however is the very last idea we should use in the history of the emergence of law it is much rather the case that for all forms of history there is no more important principle than the one which we reach with such difficulty but which we also really should reach namely that what causes a particular thing to arise and the final utility of that thing its actual use and arrangement in a system of purposes are separate toto coelo by all the heavens ie absolutely that something existing which has somehow come to its present state will again and again be interpreted by the higher powers over it from a new perspective appropriated in a new way reorganized for and redirected to new uses that all events in the organic world involve overpowering acquiring mastery and that in turn all overpowering and acquiring mastery involve a reinterpretation a readjustment in which the sense and purpose up to then must necessarily be obscured or entirely erased no matter how well we have understood the usefulness of some physiological organ or other or a legal institution a social custom a political practice some style in art or in religious cults we have not in that process grasped anything about its originno matter how uncomfortable and unpleasant this may sound in elderly ears from time immemorial people have believed that in demonstrable purposes the usefulness of a thing a form or an institution they could understand the reasons it came into existencethe eye as something made to see the hand as something made to grasp so people also imagined punishment as invented to punish but all purposes all uses are only signs that a will to power has become master over something with less power and has stamped on it its own meaning of some function and the entire history of a thing an organ a practice can by this process be seen as a continuing chain of signs of constantly new interpretations and adjustments whose causes need not be connected to each otherthey rather follow and take over from each other under merely contingent circumstances consequently the development of a thing a practice or an organ has nothing to do with its progress towards a single goal even less is it the logical and shortest progress reached with the least expenditure of power and resources but rather the sequence of more or less profound more or less mutually independent processes of overpowering which take place on that thing together with the resistance which arises against that overpowering each time the transformations of form which have been attempted for the purpose of defence and reaction as well as the results of successful countermeasures form is fluidthe meaning however is even more so even within each individual organism things are no different with every essential growth in the totality the meaning of an individual organ also shiftsin certain circumstances its partial destruction a reduction of its numbers for example through the destruction of intermediate structures can be a sign of growing power and perfection let me say this the partial loss of utility decline and degeneration the loss of meaning and purposelessness in short death also belong to the conditions of a real progress which always appears in the form of a will and a way to greater power constantly establishing itself at the expense of a huge number of smaller powers the size of a step forward can even be estimated by a measure of everything that had to be sacrificed to it the mass of humanity sacrificed for the benefit of a single stronger species of manthat would be a step forward i emphasize this major point of view about historical methodology all the more since it basically runs counter to the present ruling instinct and contemporary taste which would rather go along with the absolute contingency even the mechanical meaninglessness of all events rather than with the theory of a will to power playing itself out in everything that happens the democratic idiosyncrasy of being hostile to everything which rules and wants to rule the modern rulerhatred misarchismus to make up a bad word for a bad thing has gradually transformed itself and dressed itself up in intellectual activity the most intellectual activity to such an extent that nowadays step by step it infiltrates the strictest apparently most objective scientific research and is allowed to infiltrate it indeed it seems to me already to have attained mastery over all of physiology and the understanding of life to their detriment as is obvious because it has conjured away from them their fundamental conceptthat of real activity by contrast under the pressure of this idiosyncrasy we push adaptation into the foreground that is a secondorder activity a mere reactivityin fact people have defined life itself as an always purposeful inner adaptation to external circumstances herbert spencer but that simply misjudges the essence of life its will to power that overlooks the first priority of the spontaneous aggressive overreaching reinterpreting redirecting and shaping powers after whose effects the adaptation first follows thus the governing role of the highest functions in an organism ones in which the will for living appear active and creative are denied people should remember the criticism huxley directed at spencer for his administrative nihilism but the issue here concerns much more than administration returning to the business at hand that is to punishment we have to differentiate between two aspects of it first its relative duration the way it is carried out the action the drama a certain strict sequence of procedures and on the other hand its fluidity the meaning the purpose the expectation linked to the implementation of such procedures in this matter we can here assume without further comment per analogium by analogy in accordance with the major viewpoints about the historical method we have just established that the procedure itself will be somewhat older and earlier than its use as a punishment that the latter was only injected and interpreted into the procedure which had been present for a long time but was a tradition with a different meaning in short that it was not what our nave genealogists of morality and law up to now assumed who collectively imagined that the procedure was invented for the purpose of punishment just as people earlier thought that the hand was invented for the purpose of grasping now so far as that other element in punishment is concerned the fluid element its meaning in a very late cultural state for example in contemporary europe the idea of punishment actually presents not simply one meaning but a whole synthesis of meanings the history of punishment up to now in general the history of its use for different purposes finally crystallizes into a sort of unity which is difficult to untangle difficult to analyze and it must be stressed totally incapable of definition today it is impossible to say clearly why we really have punishmentall ideas in which an entire process is semiotically summarized elude definitiononly something which has no history is capable of being defined at an earlier stage by contrast that synthesis of meanings appears much easier to untangle as well as easier to adjust we can still see how in every individual case the elements in the synthesis alter their valence and rearrange themselves to such an extent that soon this or that element steps forward and dominates at the expense of the restindeed under certain circumstances one element say the purpose of deterrence appears to rise above all the other elements in order to give at least an idea of how uncertain how belated how accidental the meaning of punishment is and how one and the same procedure can be used interpreted or adjusted for fundamentally different purposes let me offer here an example which presented itself to me on the basis of relatively little random material punishment as a way of rendering someone harmless as a prevention from further harm punishment as compensation for the damage to the person injured in some form or other also in the form of emotional compensation punishment as isolation of some upset to an even balance in order to avert a wider outbreak of the disturbance punishment as way of bringing fear to those who determine and carry out punishment punishment as a sort of compensation for the advantages which the law breaker has enjoyed up until that time for example when he is made useful as a slave working the mines punishment as a cutting out of a degenerate element in some circumstances an entire branch as in chinese law and thus a means to keep the race pure or to sustain a social type punishment as festival that is as the violation and humiliation of some enemy one has finally thrown down punishment as a way of making a conscience whether for the man who suffers the punishmentsocalled reformor whether for those who witness the punishment being carried out punishment as the payment of an honorarium set as a condition by those in power which protects the wrong doer from the excesses of revenge punishment as a compromise with the natural condition of revenge insofar as the latter is still upheld and assumed as a privilege by powerful families punishment as a declaration of war and a war measure against an enemy to peace law order and authority which people fight with the very measures war makes available as something dangerous to the community like a contract breaker with respect to its conditions like a rebel traitor and breaker of the peace of course this list is not complete obviously punishment is overloaded with all sorts of useful purposesall the more reason why people infer from it an alleged utility which in the popular consciousness at least is considered the most essential one faith in punishment which nowadays for several reasons is getting very shaky always finds its most powerful support in precisely this punishment is supposed to be valuable in waking a feeling of guilt in the guilty party in punishment people are looking for the actual instrument for that psychic reaction called bad conscience and pangs of conscience in doing this people still apply reality and psychology incorrectly to present issuesand how much more incorrectly to the greater part of mans history his prehistory real pangs of conscience are something extremely rare especially among criminals and prisoners prisons and penitentiaries are not breeding grounds in which this species of gnawing worm particularly likes to thriveon that point all conscientious observers agree in many cases delivering such a judgment with sufficient unwillingness going against their own desires in general punishment makes people hard and cold it concentrates it sharpens the feeling of estrangement and strengthens powers of resistance if it comes about that punishment shatters a mans energy and brings on a wretched prostration and selfabasement such a consequence is surely even less pleasant than the ordinary results of punishmentcharacteristically a dry and gloomy seriousness however if we consider the millennia before the history of humanity without a second thought we can conclude that the very development of a feeling of guilt was most powerfully hindered by punishment at least with respect to the victims onto whom this force of punishment was vented for let us not underestimate just how much the criminal is prevented by the sight of judicial and executive processes from sensing the nature of his action as something inherently reprehensible for he sees exactly the same kind of actions undertaken in the service of justice applauded and practised in good conscience like espionage lying bribery entrapment the whole tricky and sly art of the police and prosecution as it develops in the various kinds of punishmentthe robbery oppression abuse imprisonment torture murder all done as a matter of principle without any emotional involvement as an excuse all these actions are in no way rejected or condemned in themselves by his judges but only in particular respects when used for certain purposes bad conscience this most creepy and interesting plant among our earthly vegetation did not grow in this soil in fact for the longest period in the past no notion of dealing with a guilty party penetrated the consciousness of judges or even those doing the punishing they were dealing with someone who had caused harm with an irresponsible piece of fate and even the man on whom punishment later fell once again like a piece of fate experienced in that no inner pain other than what came from the sudden arrival of something unpredictable a terrible natural event a falling crushing boulder against which there is no way to fight at one point spinoza became aware of this point in an incriminating way something which irritates his interpreters like kuno fischer who really go to great lengths to misunderstand him on this issue when one afternoon he came up against some memory or other who knows what and pondered the question about what as far as he was concerned was left of the celebrated morsus conscientiae the bite of consciencefor he had expelled good and evil into the human imagination and had irascibly defended the honour of his free god against those blasphemers who claimed that in everything god worked sub ratione boni with good reason but that means that god would be subordinate to fate a claim which if true would be the greatest of all contradictions for spinoza the world had gone back again into that state of innocence in which it existed before the fabrication of the idea of a bad conscience so what then had happened to the morsus conscientiae the opposite of gaudium joy spinoza finally told himself is sorrow accompanied by the image of something over and done with which happened contrary to all expectation ethics iii proposition xviii schol i ii just like spinoza those instigating evil who incurred punishment have for thousands of years felt in connection with their crime something has unexpectedly gone awry here not i should not have done that they submitted to their punishment as people submit to a sickness or some bad luck or death with that brave fatalism free of revolt which for example even today gives the russians an advantage over us westerners in coping with life if back then there was some criticism of the act such criticism came from prudence without question we must seek the essential effect of punishment above all in an increase of prudence in a extension of memory in a will to go to work from now on more carefully mistrustfully and secretly with the awareness that we are in many things definitely too weak in a kind of improved ability to judge ourselves in general what can be achieved through punishment in human beings and animals is an increase in fear a honing of prudence control over desires in the process punishment tames human beings but it does not make them better people might be more justified in asserting the opposite popular wisdom says injury makes people prudent but to the extent that it makes them prudent it also makes them bad fortunately often enough it makes people stupid at this point i can no longer avoid setting out in an initial provisional statement my own hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience it is not easy to get people to attend to it and it requires them to consider it at length to guard it and to sleep on it i consider bad conscience the profound illness which human beings had to come down with under the pressure of the most fundamental of all the changes which they experiencedthat change when they finally found themselves locked within the confines of society and peace just like the things water animals must have gone though when they were forced either to become land animals or to die off so events must have played themselves out with this halfbeast so happily adapted to the wilderness war wandering around adventuresuddenly all its instincts were devalued and disengaged from this point on these animals were to go on foot and carry themselves whereas previously they had been supported by the water a terrible heaviness weighed them down in performing the simplest things they felt ungainly in dealing with this new unknown world they no longer had their old leader the ruling unconscious drives which guided them safely these unfortunate creatures were reduced to thinking inferring calculating bringing together cause and effect reduced to their consciousness their most impoverished and errorprone organ i believe that on earth there has never been such a feeling of misery such a leaden discomfortwhile at the same time those old instincts had not all at once stopped imposing their demands only it was difficult and seldom possible to do their bidding for the most part they had to find new and as it were underground satisfactions for them all instincts which are not discharged to the outside are turned back inside this is what i call the internalization of man from this first grows in man what people later call his soul the entire inner world originally as thin as if stretched between two layers of skin expanded and extended itself acquired depth width and height to the extent that the discharge of human instinct out into the world was obstructed those frightening fortifications with which the organization of the state protected itself against the old instincts for freedompunishment belongs above all to these fortificationsmade all those instincts of the wild free roaming man turn backwards against man himself enmity cruelty joy in pursuit in attack in change in destructionall those turned themselves against the possessors of such instincts that is the origin of bad conscience the man who lacked external enemies and opposition and was forced into an oppressive narrowness and regularity of custom impatiently tore himself apart persecuted himself gnawed away at himself grew upset and did himself damagethis animal which scraped itself raw against the bars of its cage which people want to tame this impoverished creature consumed with longing for the wild had to create in itself an adventure a torture chamber an uncertain and dangerous wilderness this fool this yearning and puzzled prisoner was the inventor of bad conscience with him was introduced the greatest and weirdest illness from which human beings up to the present time have not recovered the suffering of man from his humanness from himself a consequence of the forcible separation from his animal past a leap and so to speak a fall into new situations and living conditions a declaration of war against the old instincts on which up to that point his power joy and ability to inspire fear had been based let us at once add that on the other hand the fact that there was now an animal soul turned against itself taking sides against itself provided this earth with something so new profound unheard of enigmatic contradictory and portentous that the picture of the earth was fundamentally changed in fact it required divine spectators to approve the dramatic performance which then began and whose conclusion is not yet in sight a spectacle too fine too wonderful too paradoxical to be allowed to play itself out senselessly and unobserved on some ridiculous star or other since then man has been included among the most unexpected and most thrillingly lucky rolls of the dice in the game played by heraclitus great child whether hes called zeus or chance in himself he arouses a certain interest tension hope almost a certainty as if something is announcing itself in him is preparing itself as if the human being were not the goal but only the way an episode a great promise inherent in this hypothesis about the origin of bad conscience is firstly the assumption that this change was not gradual or voluntary and did not manifest an organic growth into new conditions but was a break a leap something forced an irrefutable disaster against which there was no struggle nor any resentment secondly it assumes that the adaptation of a populace which had hitherto been unchecked and shapeless into a fixed form was initiated by an act of violence and was carried to its conclusion by nothing but sheer acts of violence that consequently the very oldest state emerged as a terrible tyranny as an oppressive and inconsiderate machinery and continued working until such a raw materials of people and halfanimals finally were not only thoroughly kneaded and submissive but also given a shape i used the word stateit is selfevident who is meant by that termsome pack of blond predatory animals a race of conquerors and masters which organized for war and with the power to organize without thinking about it sets its terrifying paws on a subordinate population which may perhaps be vast in numbers but is still without any shape is still wandering about thats surely the way the state begins on earth i believe that that fantasy has been done away with which sees the beginning of the state in some contract the man who can command who is naturally a master who comes forward with violence in his actions and gestureswhat has a man like that to do with making contracts we cannot negotiate with such beings they come like fate without cause reason consideration or pretext they are present as lightning is present too fearsome too sudden too convincing too different even to become hated their work is the instinctive creation of forms the imposition of forms they are the most involuntary and unconscious artists in existence where they appear something new is soon present a living power structure something in which the parts and functions are demarcated and coordinated in which there is in general no place for anything which does not first derive its meaning from its relationship to the totality these men these born organizers have no idea what guilt responsibility and consideration are in them that fearsome egotism of the artist is in charge which stares out like bronze and knows how to justify itself for all time in the work just like a mother with her child they are not the ones in whom bad conscience grewthat point is obvious from the outset but this hateful plant would not have grown without them it would have failed if an immense amount of freedom had not been driven from the world under the pressure of their hammer blows their artistic violenceor at least driven from sight and as it were had become latent this powerful instinct for freedom once made latent we already understand how this instinct driven back repressed imprisoned inside and finally able to discharge and direct itself only against itselfthat and that alone is what bad conscience is in its beginnings we need to be careful not to entertain a low opinion of this entire phenomenon simply because it is from the start hateful and painful basically it is the same active force which is at work on a grander scale in those artists of power and organization and which builds states here it is inner smaller more mean spirited directing itself backwards into the labyrinth of the breast to use goethes words and it creates bad conscience and builds negative ideals that very instinct for freedom to use my own language the will to power but the material on which the shaping and violating nature of this force directs itself here is man himself all his old animal self and not as in that greater and more striking phenomenon on another man or on other men this furtive violation of the self this artistic cruelty this pleasure in giving a shape to oneself as if to a tough resisting suffering material to burn into it a will a critique a contradiction a contempt a denialthis weird and horribly pleasurable work of a soul willingly divided against itself which makes itself suffer for the pleasure of creating suffering all this active bad conscience as the essential womb of ideal and imaginative events finally brought to lightwe have already guessedalso an abundance of strange new beauty and affirmation perhaps for the first time the idea of the beautiful for what would be beautiful if its opposite had not yet come to an awareness of itself if ugliness had not already said to itself i am ugly at least after this hint one paradox will be less puzzlinghow contradictory ideas like selflessness selfdenial and selfsacrifice can connote an ideal something beautiful and beyond that one thing we do knowi have no doubt about itnamely the nature of the pleasure which the selfless selfdenying selfsacrificing person experiences from the beginning this pleasure belongs to cruelty so much for the moment on the origin of the unegoistic as something of moral worth and on the demarcation of the soil out of which this value has grown only bad conscience only the will to abuse the self provides the condition for the value of the unegoistic bad conscience is a sicknesstheres no doubt about thatbut a sickness as pregnancy is a sickness lets look for the conditions in which this illness has arrived at its most terrible and most sublime peak in this way well see what really first brought about its entry into the world but that requires a lot of enduranceand we must first go back again to an earlier point the relationship in civil law between the debtor and the creditor which i have reviewed extensively already has been reinterpreted once again in an extremely remarkable and dubious historical manner into a relationship which we modern men are perhaps least capable of understanding namely into the relationship between those people presently alive and their ancestors within the original tribal cooperativeswere talking about primeval timesthe living generation always acknowledged a legal obligation to the previous generations and especially to the earliest one which had founded the tribe and this was in no way merely a sentimental obligationthe latter is something we could reasonably claim was absent for the longest period of the human race here the reigning conviction was that the tribe exists only because of the sacrifices and achievements of its ancestors and that people had to pay them back with sacrifices and achievements in this people recognize a debt which keeps steadily growing because these ancestors in their continuing existence as powerful spirits do not stop giving the tribe new advantages and lending them their power do they do this gratuitously but there is no gratuitously for these raw and spiritually destitute ages what can people give back to them sacrifices at first as nourishment understood very crudely festivals chapels signs of honour and above all obediencefor all customs as work of ones ancestors are also their statutes and commands do people ever give them enough this suspicion remains and grows from time to time it forcefully requires wholesale redemption something huge as a payment back to the creditor the notorious sacrifice of the first born for example blood human blood in any case fear of ancestors and their power the awareness of ones debt to them according to this kind of logic necessarily increases directly in proportion to the increase in the power of the tribe itself as the tribe finds itself constantly more victorious more independent more honoured and more feared its not the other way around every step towards the decline of the tribe all conditions of misery all indications of degeneration of approaching dissolution much rather lead to a constant diminution of the fear of the spirit of its founder and give a constantly smaller image of his wisdom providence and present power if we think this crude logic through to its conclusion then the ancestors of the most powerful tribes must because of the fantasy of increasing fear finally have grown into something immense and have been pushed into the darkness of a divine mystery something beyond the powers of imagination so that finally the ancestor is necessarily transfigured into a god here perhaps lies even the origin of the gods thus an origin out of fear and the man to whom it seems obligatory to add but also out of piety could hardly claim to be right for the longest period of human history for his prehistory of course he would be all the more correct for the middle period in which the noble tribes developed those who in fact paid back their founders their ancestors heroes gods with interest all the characteristics which in the meantime had become manifest in themselves the noble qualities later we will have another look at the process by which the gods were ennobled and exalted which is naturally not at all the same thing as their becoming holy but now for the moment lets follow the path of this whole development of the consciousness of guilt to its conclusion as history teaches us the consciousness of being in debt to the gods did not in any way come to an end after the downfall of communities organized on the basis of blood relationships just as humanity inherited the ideas of good and bad from the nobility of the tribe together with its fundamental psychological tendency to set up orders of rank in the same way people also inherited as well as the divinities of the tribe and of the extended family the pressure of as yet unpaid debts and the desire to be relieved of them the transition is made with those numerous slave and indentured populations which adapted themselves to the divine cults of their masters whether through compulsion or through obsequiousness and mimicry from them this inheritance overflowed in all directions the feeling of being indebted to the gods did not stop growing for several thousands of yearsalways in fact in direct proportion to the extent to which the idea of god and the feeling for god grew and were carried to the heights the entire history of ethnic fighting victory reconciliation mergerseverything which comes before the final rank ordering of all the elements of a people in that great racial synthesisis mirrored in the tangled genealogies of its gods in the sagas of their fights victories and reconciliations the progress towards universal kingdoms is at the same time always also the progress toward universal divinities in addition despotism with its overthrow of the independent nobles always builds the way to some variety of monotheism the arrival of the christian god as the greatest god which has yet been reached thus brought a manifestation of the greatest feeling of indebtedness on earth assuming that we have gradually set out in the reverse direction we can infer with no small probability that given the inexorable decline of faith in the christian god even now there already may be a considerable decline in the human consciousness of guilt indeed we cannot dismiss the idea that the complete and final victory of atheism could release humanity from this entire feeling of being indebted to its origins its causa prima prime cause atheism and a kind of second innocence belong together so much for a brief and rough preface concerning the connection between the ideas guilt and obligation with religious assumptions up to this point i have deliberately set aside the actual moralizing of these ideas the repression of them into the conscience or more precisely the complex interaction between a bad conscience and the idea of god at the end of the previous section i even talked as if there was no such thing as this moralizing and thus as if now these ideas had necessarily come to an end after the collapse of their presuppositions the faith in our creditor in god but to a terrifying extent the facts indicate something different the moralizing of the ideas of debt and duty with their repression into bad conscience actually gave rise to the attempt to reverse the direction of the development i have just described or at least to bring its motion to a halt now in a fit of pessimism the prospect of a final installment must once and for all be denied now our gaze is to bounce and ricochet back despairingly off an iron impossibility now those ideas of debt and duty are supposed to turn back but against whom there can be no doubt first of all against the debtor in whom from this point on bad conscience firmly set in him eating into him and spreading out like a polyp grows wide and deep until finally with the impossibility of discharging the debt people conceive of the idea of the impossibility of removing the penance the idea that the debt cannot be paid off eternal punishment finally however those ideas of debt and duty turn back even against the creditor people should in this matter now think about the causa prima first cause of humanity about the beginning of the human race about their ancestor who from now on is loaded down with a curse adam original sin no freedom of the will or about nature from whose womb human beings arose and into whom from now on the principle of evil is inserted the demonizing of nature or about existence in general which remains something without value in itself nihilistic turning away from existence longing for nothingness or a desire for its opposite in an alternate state of being buddhism and things like thatuntil all of a sudden we confront the paradoxical and horrifying expedient with which a martyred humanity found temporary relief that stroke of genius of christianitygods sacrifice of himself for the guilt of human beings god paying himself back with himself god as the only one who can redeem man from what for human beings has become impossible to redeemthe creditor sacrifices himself for the debtor out of love can people believe that out of love for his debtor you will already have guessed what went on with all this and behind all this that will to selftorment that repressed cruelty of animal man pushed inward and forced back into himself imprisoned in the state to make him tame who invented bad conscience in order to lacerate himself after the more natural discharge of this will to inflict pain had been blocked this man with a bad conscience seized upon religious assumptions to drive his selftorment into something most horrifyinghard and sharp guilt towards god this idea becomes his instrument of torture he sees in god the ultimate contrast he is capable of discovering to his real and indissoluble animal instincts he interprets these very animal instincts as a crime against god as enmity rebellion revolt against the master the father the original ancestor and beginning of the world he grows tense with the contradiction of god and devil he hurls from himself every denial which he says to himself his nature his naturalness the reality of his being as an affirmative yes as something existing as living as real as god as the blessedness of god as god the judge as god the hangman as something beyond him as eternity as perpetual torment as hell as punishment and guilt beyond all measure in this mental cruelty there is a kind of insanity of the will which simply has no equal a mans will finding him so guilty and reprehensible that there is no atonement his will to imagine himself punished but in such a way that the punishment can never be adequate for his crime his will to infect and poison the most fundamental basis of things with the problem of punishment and guilt in order to cut himself off once and for all from any exit out of this labyrinth of fixed ideas his will to erect an ideal that of the holy god in order to be tangibly certain of his own absolute worthlessness when confronted with it oh this insane sad beast man what ideas he has what unnaturalness what paroxysms of nonsense what bestiality of thought breaks from him as soon as he is prevented if only a little from being a beast in deed all this is excessively interesting but theres also a black gloomy unnerving sadness about it so that man must forcefully hold himself back from gazing too long into these abysses here we have an illnessno doubt about thatthe most terrifying illness that has raged in human beings up to now and anyone who can still hear but nowadays people no longer have the ear for this how in this night of torment and insanity the cry of love has resounded the cry of the most yearning delight of redemption through love turns away seized by an invincible horror in human beings there is so much that is terrible for too long the world has been a lunatic asylum these remarks should be sufficient once and for all concerning the origin of the holy god the fact that conceiving gods does not necessarily in itself lead to a degraded imaginationthats something we have to consider for a moment the point that there are more uplifting ways to use the invention of the gods than for this human selfcrucifixion and selflaceration of man in which europe in the last millennia has become an expert fortunately that something we can infer if we take a look at the greek gods these reflections of nobler men more rulers of themselves in whom the animal in man felt himself deified and did not tear himself apart did not rage against himself these greeks for the longest time used their gods for the very purpose of keeping that bad conscience at a distance in order to be able to continue enjoying their psychic freedom hence their understanding was the opposite of how christianity used its god in this matter the greeks went a long way these splendid and lionhearted greeks with their childlike minds and no lesser authority than that of homers zeus himself now and then tells them that they are making things too easy for themselves its strange he says at one point in relation to the case of aegisthus a very bad case its strange how these mortal creatures complain about the gods evil comes only from us they claim but they themselves stupidly make themselves miserable even contrary to fate but at the same time we hear and see that even this olympian spectator and judge is far from being irritated or thinking of them as evil because of this how foolish they are he thinks in relation to the bad deeds of mortal men and the greeks of the strongest and bravest times conceded that much about themselvesthe foolishness stupidity a little disturbance in the head were the basis for many bad and fateful thingsfoolishness not sin do you understand that but even this disturbance in the head was a problem indeed how is this even possible where could this have really come from in heads like the ones we have we men of noble descent happy successful from the best society noble and virtuous for hundreds of years the noble greek posed this question to himself in relation to any incomprehensible horror or outrage which had defiled one of his peers some god must have deluded him he finally said shaking his head this solution is typical of the greeks in this way the gods then served to justify men to a certain extent even in bad things they served as the origin of evilat that time the gods took upon themselves not punishment but what is nobler the guilt ill conclude with three question marksthats clear enough you may perhaps ask me is an ideal being built up here or shattered but have you ever really asked yourself how high a price has been paid on earth for the construction of every ideal how much reality had to be constantly vilified and misunderstood how many lies had to be consecrated how many consciences corrupted how much god had to be sacrificed every time that is the lawshow me the case where it has not been fulfilled we modern men we are the inheritors of the vivisection of the conscience and the selfinflicted animal torture of the past millennia thats what we have had the longest practice doing that is perhaps our artistryin any case it is something we have refined the corruption of our taste for too long man has looked at his natural inclinations with an evil eye so that finally in him they have become twinned with bad conscience an attempt to reverse this might in itself be possible but who is strong enough for that that is to link with bad conscience the unnatural inclinations all those aspirations for what lies beyond us those things which go against our senses against our instincts against nature against animalsin short the earlier ideals all the ideals which are hostile to life and which have vilified the world to whom can we turn to today with such hopes and demands we would have precisely the good men against us as well of course as the comfortable the complacent the vain the enthusiastic the tired but what is more offensive what cuts us off more fundamentally from these others than letting them take some note of the severity and loftiness with which we deal with ourselves and by contrast how obliging how friendly all the world is in relation to us as soon as we act as all the world does and let ourselves go just like everyone else to attain the goal im talking about requires a different sort of spirit than those which really exist at this time spirits empowered by war and victory for whom conquest adventure danger and even pain have become a need that would require getting acclimatized to keen high air winter wanderings to ice and mountains in every sense that would require even a kind of sublime maliciousness an ultimate selfconscious willfulness of knowledge which comes with great health briefly put that would unfortunately require this great health is this even possible today but at some time or other in a more powerful time than this mouldy selfdoubting present he must nonetheless come to us the redeeming man of great love and contempt the creative spirit constantly pushed away from the sidelines or from the beyond by his own driving power whose isolation is misunderstood by people as if it were a flight from reality whereas it is his immersion burial and absorption into nothing but reality so that once he comes out of it into the light again he brings back the redemption of this reality its redemption from the curse which the previous ideal had laid upon it this man of the future who will release us from that earlier ideal and in so doing from those things which had to grow from it from the great loathing from the will to nothingness from nihilismthat stroke of noon and of the great decision which makes the will free once again who gives back to the earth its purpose and to human beings their hope this antichrist and antinihilist this conqueror of god and of nothingnessat some point he must come but what am i talking about here enough enough at this stage theres only one thing appropriate for me to do keep quiet otherwise ill make the mistake of arrogating to myself something which only someone younger is free to do someone with a greater future someone more powerful than isomething which only zarathustra is free to do zarathustra the godless third essay what do ascetic ideals mean carefree mocking violentthat what wisdom wants us to be she is a woman she always loves a man of war thus spoke zarathustra what do ascetic ideals meanamong artists they mean nothing or too many different things among philosophers and scholars they mean something like having a nose or an instinct for the most auspicious conditions of a higher spirituality among women at best an additional seductive charm a little morbidezza small morbidity on beautiful flesh the angelic quality of a nicelooking plump animal among physiologically impaired and peevish people that is among the majority of mortals they are an attempt to imagine themselves as too good for this world a holy form of orgiastic excess their chief tool in the fight with their enduring pain and boredom among the clergy they are the foundation of their priestly faith their best instrument of power and also the most important of all permits for their power finally among the saints they are a pretext for hibernation their novissima gloriae cupido most recent desire for glory their repose in nothingness god their form of insanity however the fact that generally the ascetic ideal has meant so much to human beings is an expression of the basic fact of the human will its horror vacui horror of a vacuum it requires a goaland it will sooner will nothingness than not will do you understand me have you understood me not in the slightest my dear sir all right lets start from the beginning what do ascetic ideals mean or to take a single example which i have been asked to consider often enough what does it mean when for instance an artist like richard wagner in his later years pays homage to chastity in a certain sense of course he always did this but in an ascetic sense he did it for the first time at the end what does this change in sense mean this radical change in the sense for thats what it waswith it wagner leapt right over into his opposite what does it mean when an artist leaps over into his opposite if we are willing to pause momentarily at this question we immediately encounter the memory of perhaps the best strongest most cheerful and bravest period in wagners lifethe time when he was innerly and deeply preoccupied with the idea of luthers marriage who knows the circumstances which saw to it that today instead of this wedding music we have die meistersinger wagners opera the master singers and how much of the former work may perhaps echo in the latter but there is no doubt that this luthers wedding would have involved the praise of chastity of course it would also have contained a praise of sensualityand that it strikes me would have been quite appropriate very wagnerian for between chastity and sensuality there is no essential opposition every good marriage every genuine affair of the heart transcends them both in my view wagner would have done well if he had enabled his germans to take this pleasant fact to heart once more with the help of a lovely and brave comedy about luther for among the germans there are always a lot of people who slander sensuality and luthers value is probably nowhere greater than precisely here he had the courage of his own sensuality at that time people called it delicately enough evangelical freedom but even if it were the case that there really were an antithesis between chastity and sensuousness fortunately there is no need for it to be a tragic antithesis at least this should be the case for all successful and cheerful mortals who are far from considering their unstable equilibrium between animal and angel as in itself an argument against existence the finest and brightest like goethe like hafiz even saw that that made life more attractive its precisely contradictions like that which make life more enticing on the other hand its easy enough to understand that once pigs who have had bad luck are persuaded to worship chastityand there are such swinethey see in chastity only their opposite the opposite to unlucky pigs and will worship thatand with such zealous tragic grunting we can imagine itthat embarrassing and unnecessary antithesis which richard wagner at the end of his life unquestioningly still wanted to set to music and produce on stage what on earth for thats a fair question for why should he be concerned about pigs why should we in this matter there is of course another question we cannot circumvent why wagner was concerned about that manly and also so unmanly simpleton from the country that poor devil and nature boy parsifal whom he finally turned into a catholic in such an embarrassing way what was this parsifal really meant to be taken seriously for we could be tempted to assume the reverse even to desire itthat the wagnerian parsifal was intended to be cheerful as it were a concluding piece and satyr drama with which the tragic writer wagner wanted to take his farewell in an respectful manner worthy of him from us from himself and above all from tragedy that is with an excess of the highest and most highspirited parody of tragedy itself of the entire dreadful earthy seriousness and earthy wailing of his earlier works of the crudest form in the perversity of the ascetic ideal conquered at last that would have been as mentioned worthy of a great tragedian who like every artist first attains the final peak of greatness when he knows how to see himself and his art as beneath him when knows how to laugh at himself is parsifal wagners secret superior laughter at himself the triumph of his achieving the ultimate and highest artistic freedom his movement beyond art as ive said we might wish that for what would parsifal be if intended seriously do we need to see in it as it was put to me the epitome of an insane hatred for knowledge spirit and sensuality a curse on the senses and the spirit in one breath of hatred an apostasy and going back to sickly christian and obscurantist ideals and finally even a denial of the self a cancellation of the self from an artist who up to that point had directed all the power of his will to attain the reverse namely the highest spiritualization and sensuousness in his art and not only in his art but also in his life we should remember how wagner once so enthusiastically followed in the footsteps of the philosopher feuerbach feuerbachs phrase about healthy sensualityin wagners thirties and forties as with many germans they called themselves the young germans that phrase rang out like a word of redemption did wagner finally learn something different it appears at least that he finally wanted to teach something different and not only on the stage with the parsifal trombones in the cloudy writings of his last yearsas constricted as they are bafflingthere are a hundred places which betray a secret wish and will a despondent uncertain unacknowledged will to preach nothing but going back conversion denial christianity medievalism and to say to his followers theres nothing here seek salvation somewhere else in one place he even calls out to the blood of the redeemer in a case like wagners which is in many ways an embarrassing one although the example is typical my opinion is that its certainly best to separate an artist far enough from his work so that one does not take him with the same seriousness as one does his work in the final analysis he is only the precondition for his work its maternal womb the soil or in some cases the dung and manure out of which it growsand thus in most cases something that we must forget about if we want to enjoy the work itself our understanding of the origin of a work involves physiologists and vivisectionists of the spiritnever the aesthetic men the artists never in a deep fundamental way something terrifying for the spirit the poet and composer of parsifal could not escape living inside and descending into the conflicts of the medieval soul a hostile distance from all spiritual loftiness rigor and discipline a form of intellectual perversity if you will forgive the expression any more than a pregnant woman can escape the repellent and strange aspects of pregnancysomething which as i have said we must forget if we want to enjoy the child we should be on our guard against that confusion which arises from psychological contiguity to use an english word a confusion in which even an artist can too easily get caught up as if he himself were what he can present imagine and express in fact the case is this if thats what he was he simply would not present imagine or express it homer would not have written a poem about achilles or goethe a poem about faust if homer had been achilles or goethe had been faust a complete and entire artist is forever separated from the real what actually is on the other hand one can comprehend how he can sometimes grow weary of this eternal unreality and falseness of his innermost existence to the point of desperation and how he then makes an attempt for once to reach over into what is forbidden precisely to him into reality in an attempt to be real what success does he have we can guess that is the typical mere wishfulness of the artistthe same mere wishfulness which fell over wagner once hed grown old and for which he had to pay such a high and fatal price because of it he lost a valuable number of his friends finally however and quite apart from this mere wishfulness of his who would not desire that wagnerfor his own sakehad taken his leave of us and his art in a different manner not with a parsifal but more victoriously more selfconfidently more like wagnerless deceptive less ambiguous about all his intentions less like schopenhauer less nihilistic so what then do ascetic ideals mean in the case of an artist we know the answer immediatelynothing at all or they mean so many things that they amount to nothing at all so lets eliminate the artists right away they do not stand independent of the world and against the world long enough for their evaluations and the changes in those evaluations to merit our interest for their own sake they have in all ages been valets to a morality or philosophy or religion quite apart from the fact that often enough they unfortunately have been the alltooadaptable courtiers of groups of their followers and above all their patrons and finenosed flatterers of old or even newly arriving powers at the very least they always need a means of protection a support an already established authority the artist never stands by himselfstanding alone contravenes his deepest instincts hence for example richard wagner took the philosopher schopenhauer once his time had come as his point man his protection who could have even imagined that he would have had the courage for an ascetic ideal without the support which schopenhauers philosophy offered without the authority of schopenhauer which had become predominant in europe in the s and thats not even considering whether in the new germany it would have been at all possible to be an artist without the milk of a pious imperially pious way of thinking and so with this we come to the more serious question what does it mean when a real philosopher pays homage to the ascetic ideal a truly independent spirit like schopenhauer a man and a knight with an iron gaze who was courageous enough to be himself who knew how to stand alone and did not first wait for a point man and higher signs here let us consider right away the remarkable and for all kinds of people fascinating position of schopenhauer on art for that was apparently the reason richard wagner first moved over to schopenhauer persuaded to do that as we know by the poet herwegh that shift was so great that it opened up a complete theoretical contrast between his earlier and his later aesthetic beliefs between for example the earlier views expressed in opera and drama and the later views in the writings which he published from on in particular what is perhaps most surprising is that from this point on wagner ruthlessly altered his judgment of the value and place of music itself why should it concern him that earlier he had used music as a means a medium a woman something which simply required a purpose a man in order to flourishthat is drama but suddenly he realized that with schopenhauers theory and innovation he could do more in majorem musicae gloriam for the greater glory of musicthat is through the sovereignty of music as schopenhauer had understood it music set apart from all other arts the inherently independent art and not like the other arts offering copies of phenomena but rather the voice of the will itself speaking out directly from the abyss as its most authentic most primordial most original revelation with this extraordinary increase in the value of music as this seemed to grow out of schopenhauers philosophy the musician himself suddenly grew in value to an unheardof extent from now on he would be an oracle a priest even more than a priest a kind of mouthpiece of the essence of things a telephone from the world beyond usin future he didnt speak only of music this ventriloquist of god he talked metaphysics is it any wonder finally one day he spoke about ascetic ideals schopenhauer used kants formulation of the aesthetic problem although he certainly did not examine it with kantian eyes kant thought he had honoured art when among the predicates of the beautiful he gave priority to and set in the foreground those which constitute the honour of knowledgeimpersonality and universal validity this is not the place to explore whether or not this is for the most part a false idea the only thing i wish to stress is that kant like all philosophers instead of taking aim at the aesthetic problem from the experiences of the artist the creator thought about art and the beautiful only from the point of view of the looker on and therefore without noticing it brought the spectator himself into the concept beautiful if only these philosophers of beauty were at least more knowledgeable about this spectatorthat is as a significant personal fact and experience as a wealth of very particular strong experiences desires surprises and delight in the realm of the beautiful but i fear the opposite has always been the case and so from the very start we get from them definitions like that famous definition which kant gives for the beautiful in which the lack of a finer sensitivity sits in the shape of a thick worm of fundamental error the beautiful kant said is what pleases in a disinterested way in a disinterested way lets compare this definition with that other one formulated by a true spectator and artiststendhal who once called the beautiful a promesse de bonheur a promise of happiness here the disinterestedness dsintressement which kant made the single element in the aesthetic state is clearly rejected and deleted whos right kant or stendhal naturally if our aestheticians never get tired of weighing the issue in kants favour claiming that under the magic spell of beauty people can look even at naked female statues without interest we can laugh a little at their expense in relation to this delicate matter the experiences of artists are interesting and pygmalion was certainly not necessarily an unaesthetic man lets think all the better of the innocence of our aestheticians which is reflected in such arguments for example lets count it to kants honour that he knew how to lecture on the characteristic properties of the sense of touch with the navet of a country parson this point brings us back to schopenhauer who stood measurably closer to the arts than kant but who nonetheless did not get away from the spell of the kantian definition how did that happen the circumstance is sufficiently odd he interpreted the word disinterested in the most personal manner from a single experience which must have been something routine with him there are few things schopenhauer talks about with as much confidence as he does about the effect of aesthetic contemplation in connection with that he states that it counteracts sexual interestand thus acts like lupulin or camphor he never got tired of extolling this emancipation from the will as the great advantage and use of the aesthetic state indeed we could be tempted to ask whether his basic conception of will and idea the notion that there could be a redemption from the will only through representation might have taken its origin from his universalizing his sexual experience with all questions concerning schopenhauers philosophy incidentally we should never fail to consider that it is the conception of a twentysixyearold young man so that it involves not merely the specific details of schopenhauer but also the specific details of that time of life if for example we listen to one of the most expressive passages from the countless ones he wrote to honour the aesthetic stance world and will and idea i we hear its tone the suffering the happiness the gratitude uttered in words like these that is the painless state which epicurus valued as the highest good and as the condition of the gods for that moment we are relieved of the contemptible drive of the will we celebrate a holiday den sabbat from the penal servitude to the will the wheel of ixion stands motionless what vehemence there is in these words what a picture of torment and long weariness what an almost pathological contrast between that moment and the usual wheel of ixion the penal servitude to the will the contemptible drive of the will but if we assumed that schopenhauer was right a hundred times about himself what would that provide by way of insight into the essence of the beautiful schopenhauer wrote about one effect of the beautifulthe way it calms the will but is there only one regular effect stendhal as mentioned a no less sensual person but with a natural constitution much happier than schopenhauers emphasized another effect of the beautiful the beautiful promises happiness to him the fact of the matter seemed to be that the will interest was aroused by the beautiful and could we not finally object about schopenhauer himself that he was very wrong to think of himself as a kantian in this matter that he had completely failed to understand kants definition of the beautiful in a kantian manner that even he found the beautiful pleasing out of a certain interest even out of the strongest and most personal interest of all that of a torture victim who escapes from his torture and to come back to that first question what does it mean when a philosopher renders homage to the ascetic ideal we get here at least our first hint he wants to escape his own torture lets be careful not to create gloomy images out of that word torture in this case there remains enough to draw a different conclusion to offset the wordthere even remains something to laugh about for lets not underestimate the fact that schopenhauer who in fact treated sexuality as a personal enemy including its instrument woman this instrumentum diaboli tool of the devil needed enemies in order to maintain his good spirits that he loved grim caustic blackgreen words that he got angry for the sake of getting passionately angry that he would have become ill would have become a pessimist and he wasnt a pessimist no matter how much he wanted to be one without his enemies without hegel women sensuousness and the whole will for existence for continued life had that been the case schopenhauer would not have continuedon that we can wager he would have run off but his enemies held him securely his enemies always seduced him back to existence like the ancient cynics his anger was his refreshment his relaxation payment his remedy for disgust his happiness so much with respect to the most personal features in schopenhauer on the other hand with him there is still something typicaland here we finally come up against our problem once more as long as there have been philosophers on earth and wherever there have been philosophers from india to england to name two opposite poles of talent in philosophy there unquestionably have existed a genuine philosophical irritability with and rancour against sensuousness schopenhauer is only the most eloquent eruption of these and if you have an ear for it the most captivating and delightful in addition there exist a real philosophical bias and affection favouring the whole ascetic ideal no one should fool himself about that as mentioned both belong to the philosophical type if both are missing in a philosopher then he is always only a socalled philosopherthat we know for certain what does that mean for we must first interpret this something which stands there inherently and eternally stupid like every thing in itself every animal including also la bte philosophe the philosophical beast instinctively strives for the optimal beneficial conditions in which it can let out all its power and attain the strongest feeling of its strength every animal in the same instinctual way and with a refined sense of smell that is loftier than all reason dislikes any kind of trouble maker or barrier which lies or which could lie in its way to these optimal conditions im not speaking about its path to happiness but about its way to power to action to its most powerful deeds and in most cases really about its way to unhappiness thus the philosopher dislikes marriage as well as what might persuade him into itmarriage is a barrier and a disaster along his route to the optimal what great philosopher up to now has been married heraclitus plato descartes spinoza leitniz kant schopenhauernone of these got married whats more we cannot even imagine them married a married philosopher belongs in a comedy thats my principle and socrates the exception the malicious socrates it appears got married ironically to demonstrate this very principle every philosopher would speak as once buddha spoke when someone told him of the birth his son rahula has been born to me a shackle has been forged for me rahula here means a little demon to every free spirit there must come a reflective hour provided that previously he has had a one without thought of the sort that came then to buddhalife in a house he thought to himself is narrow and confined a polluted place freedom consists of abandoning houses because he thought this way he left the house ascetic ideals indicate so many bridges to independence that a philosopher cannot without an inner rejoicing and applause listen to the history of all those decisive people who one day said no to all lack of freedom and went off to some desert or other even given the fact that such people were strong donkeys and entirely different from a powerful spirit so what then does the ascetic ideal mean as far as a philosopher is concerned my answer isyou will have guessed it long agothe philosopher smiles when he sees an optimal set of conditions for the loftiest and boldest spirituality in so doing he does not deny existence rather thats how he affirms his existence and only his existence and does this perhaps to such a degree that he stays close to the wicked desire perat mundus fiat philosphia fiat phiosophus fiam let the world perish but let philosophy exist let the philosopher exist let me exist you see that these philosophers are not unprejudiced witnesses to and judges of the value of ascetic ideals they think about themselveswhat concern to them is the saint in this matter they think about what is most immediately indispensable to them freedom from compulsion disturbance fuss business duties worriesa bright light in the head the dance the leap and flight of ideas a good airthin clear free drylike the air at high altitudes with which everything in animal being grows more spiritual and acquires wings calm in all basement areas all dogs nicely tied up in chains no hostile barking or shaggy rancour no gnawing worm of wounded ambition with modest and humble inner organs busy as windmills but at a distance heart strange distant looking to the future posthumousall in all so far as the ascetic ideal is concerned they think of the cheerful asceticism of some deified and independent animal which wanders above life rather than resting in it we know what the three great catchphrases of the ascetic idea are poverty humility and chastity if we now look closely at the lives of all great prolific inventive spirits well always rediscover all three there to a certain degree not at all this is selfevident as if it were something to do with their virtueswhat does this kind of man have to do with creating virtuesbut as the most appropriate and most natural conditions of their best existence their most beautiful fecundity it is indeed entirely possible that their dominating spirituality at first had to set aside an unbridled pride or the reins of a wanton sensuality or that they perhaps had difficulty enough maintaining their will for the desert against an inclination for luxury for something very exquisite as well as a lavish liberality of heart and hand but their spirituality did it precisely because it was the dominating instinct which achieves its own demands in relation to all the other instincts and continues to do so if it did not then it would no longer dominate hence this has nothing to do with virtue besides the desert of which i just spoke into which the strong independent spirits withdraw and isolate themselvesoh how different it seems from the desert educated people dream about for in some circumstances these educated people are themselves this desert and certainly no actor of the spirit could simply endure itfor them it is not nearly romantic enough or syrian not nearly enough of a theatrical desert its true theres no lack of camels therebut thats the only similarity between them perhaps a voluntary obscurity a detour away from ones self a timidity about noise admiration newspapers influence a small official position a daily routine something which hides more than it bring to light contact now and then with harmless cheerful wildlife and poultry whose sight is relaxing a mountain for company not a dead one but one with eyes that means with lakes in some circumstances even a room in a full nondescript inn where one is sure to be confused for someone else and can talk to anyone with impunitythats what a desert is here oh its lonely enough believe me when heraclitus withdrew into the courtyard and colonnades of the immense temple of artemis that was a worthier desert i admit why do we lack such temples perhaps we dont lack them ive just remembered my most beautiful room for study the piazza san marco in the spring naturally as well as in the morning between ten and twelve oclock but what heraclitus was getting away from is still the same thing we go out of our way to escape the noise and the democratic chatter of the ephesians their politics their news about the empire you understand i mean the persians their daily market junkfor we philosophers need peace and quiet from one thing above allfrom anything to do with today we honour what is still cold noble distant past in general everything at the sight of which the soul does not have to defend itself or tie itself up something a person can speak to without having to speak loudly let us hear only the sound which a spirit makes when it speaks every spirit has its own sound and loves its own sound the man over there for example must be a real agitator i mean a hollow head a hollow pot hohlkopf hohltopfno matter what goes into him it all comes back out of him dull and thick weighed down with the echo from a huge emptiness that man over there rarely speaks in anything other than a hoarse voice has he perhaps imagined himself hoarse that might be possibleask the physiologistsbut whoever thinks in words thinks as a speaker and not as a thinker it reveals that fundamentally he doesnt think of things or think factually but only in relation to things that he really is thinking of himself and his listeners a third man speaks with an insistent familiarityhe steps in too close to our bodies he breathes over usinstinctively we shut our mouths even though he is speaking to us through a book the sound of his style tells us why we do thatthat he has no time that he has little faith in himself that hell not be speaking any more today or ever but a spirit which is sure of itself speaks quietly hes looking for seclusion he lets people wait for him we can recognize a philosopher by the following he walks away from three glittering and garish thingsfame princes and women that doesnt mean that they might not come to him he shrinks from light which is too bright hence he shies away from his time and its day in that hes like a shadow the lower the sun sinks the bigger he becomes so far as his humility is concerned he endures a certain dependence and obscurity as he endures the darkness more than that he fears being disturbed by lightning and recoils from the unprotected and totally isolated and abandoned tree on which any bad weather can discharge its mood or any mood discharge its bad weather his maternal instinct the secret love for what is growing in him directs him to places where his need to think of himself is removed in the same sense that the maternal instinct in women has up to now generally kept her in a dependent situation ultimately they demand little enough these philosophers their motto is whoever owns things is ownednot as i must say again and again from virtue from an admirable desire for modest living and simplicity but because their highest master demands that of them demands astutely and unrelentingly he cares for only one thing and for that gathers up and holds everythingtime power love and interest this sort of man doesnt like to be disturbed by hostile things or by friendships and he easily forgets or scoffs to him martyrdom seems something in bad tasteto suffer for the truth he leaves to the ambitious and the stage heroes of the spirit and anyone else who has time enough for it they themselvesthe philosophershave to do something for the truth they use big words sparingly its said that they resist using even the word truthit sounds boastful finally as far as chastity concerns philosophers this sort of spirit apparently keeps its fertility in something other than children perhaps he keeps the continuity of his name elsewhere its small immortality among philosophers in ancient india people spoke with more presumption whats the point of offspring to the man whose soul is the world theres no sense of chastity there out of some ascetic scruple or other or hatred of the sensesjust as it has little to do with chastity when an athlete or jockey abstains from women its more a matter of their dominating instinct at least during its great pregnant periods every artist knows how damaging the effects of sexual intercourse are to states of great spiritual tension and preparation the most powerful and most instinctual artists dont acquire this knowledge primarily by experience by bad experienceits that maternal instinct of theirs which makes the decision ruthlessly to benefit the developing work among all the other stores and supplies of energy of animal vitality the greater power then uses up the lesser now lets apply this interpretation to the above mentioned case of schopenhauer the sight of the beautiful evidently worked in his case as the stimulus for the release of the main power in his nature the power of reflection and the deep look so that this then exploded and suddenly became master of his consciousness in the process we should in no way rule out the possibility that that characteristic sweetness and abundance typical of the aesthetic condition could originate precisely from the ingredient sensuality just as from the same source is derived that idealism characteristic of sexually mature young girlsso that thus with the entry of the aesthetic condition sensuality is not shoved out as schopenhauer believed but is transformed and does not enter the consciousness any more as sexual stimulation i will come back to this point of view at another time in connection with the even more delicate problems of the physiology of aesthetics a problem untouched up to this point so unanalyzed a certain asceticism as we have seen a hard and cheerful renunciation in the best wills belongs to those conditions favourable to the highest spirituality and is also among its most natural consequences so of course its no wonder that philosophers in particular never treat the ascetic ideal without some bias a serious historical review demonstrates that the tie between the ascetic ideal and philosophy is even much narrower and stronger we could say it was in the leading reins of this ideal that philosophy in general learned to take its first small steps on earthalas still so awkwardly alas still with such a morose expression alas so read to fall over and lie on its belly this small tentative clumsy loving infant with crooked legs at the start with philosophy things played themselves out as with all good things for a long time it had no courage for itselfit always looked around to see if anyone would come to its assistance and yet was afraid of all those who gazed at it just make a list of the individual desires and virtues of the philosopherhis desire to doubt his desire to deny his desire to wait the ephectic desire his desire to analyze his desire to research to seek out to take chances his desire to compare and weigh evenly his will for neutrality and objectivity his will to that sine ira et studio without anger and partialitycan you not understand that all of them went against the demands of morality and conscience to say nothing at all about reason in general which even luther liked to call mrs clever the clever whore and that if a philosopher had come to an awareness of himself he would have necessarily felt that he was the living manifestation of nitimur in vetitum we search for whats forbidden and thus taken care not to feel himself not to become conscious of himself as ive said the case is the same with all the good things of which we are nowadays so proud measured by the standards of the ancient greeks our entire modern being insofar as it is not weakness but power and consciousness of power looks like sheer hubris and godlessness for the very opposite of those things we honour today had for the longest period conscience on their side and god to guard over them our entire attitude to nature today our violation of nature with the help of machines and the unimaginable inventiveness of our technicians and engineers is hubris our attitude to god is hubrisim referring to our attitude to that alleged spider spinning out purposes and morality behind the fabric of the huge safety net of causalitywe could say with charles the bold in his struggle with ludwig xi je combats luniversealle araigne i am fighting the universal spider our attitude to ourselves is hubris for we experiment with ourselves in a manner we would not permit with any animal and happily and inquisitively slit the souls of living bodies open what do we now care about the salvation of the soul we cure ourselves later illness teaches us thingswe dont doubt thatits even more instructive than health the person who makes us ill appears to us nowadays to be more important even than medical people and saviours we violate ourselves now no doubt about it we nut crackers of the soul we questioning and questionable people as if life were nothing else but cracking nuts and in so doing we necessarily become every day constantly more questionable more worthy of asking questions and in the process perhaps also worthierto live all good things were once bad things every original sin becomes an original virtue for example marriage for a long time seemed to be a sin against the rights of the community once people paid a fine for being so presumptuous as to arrogate a woman to themselves that involves for instance the jus primae noctis the right of the first night even today in cambodia the privilege of the priests these guardians of good ancient customs the gentle favourable yielding sympathetic feelingswhich over time grew so valuable that they are almost value in itselffor the longest period were countered by selfcontempt people were ashamed of being mild just as today they are ashamed of being hard compare beyond good and evil p subjugation under the lawhow the noble races throughout the earth had to fight their conscience to renounce the vendetta and to concede the power of the law over them for a long time the law was a vetitum something prohibited a sacrilege an innovationit appeared with force and as force something to which people submitted only with a feeling of shame for their conduct every one of the smallest steps on earth in earlier days was fought for with spiritual and physical torture this whole historical point that not only moving forward no but all walking moving and changing necessarily involved countless martyrs nowadays sounds so strange to us in the dawn pp ff i brought out this point nothing has come at a higher price it says there on p than the small amount of human reason and feeling of freedom which we are now so proud of but because of this pride it is now almost impossible to sense how that huge stretch of time of the morality of custom which comes before world history is the really decisive and important history which established the character of humanity where people recognized suffering as a virtue cruelty as a virtue pretence as a virtue revenge as a virtue the denial of reason as a virtue and by contrast well being as a danger the desire for knowledge as a danger peace as a danger sympathy as a danger being pitied as a disgrace work as a disgrace insanity as divinity change as untraditional and inherently pregnant with ruin the same book on page explains the system of values the pressure of a system of values which the most ancient race of contemplative men had to live under a race that when it was not feared was widely despised contemplation first appeared on earth in a disguised shape with an ambiguous appearance with an evil heart and often with a worried head theres no doubt about that the inactive brooding unwarlike elements in the instincts of contemplative people for a long time fostered mistrust around them against which the only way to cope was to arose an emphatic fear of the self the ancient brahmins for example understood that the most ancient philosophers knew how to earn meaning for their existence and their appearance some security and background because of which people learned to fear them to look at the matter more closely this happened because of an even more fundamental need that is the need to win fear and respect for themselves for they discovered inside them that all judgments of value had been reversed they had to beat down all kinds of suspicions about and resistance to the philosopher inside them as men of dreadful times they achieved this with dreadful means cruelty against themselves inventive selfdenialthat was the major instrument of these powerhungry hermits and new thinkers who found it necessary first to overthrow the gods and traditions inside themselves in order to be able to believe in their innovation i recall the famous story of king vishvamitra who through a thousand years of selftorments acquired such a feeling of power and faith in his own capabilities that he committed himself to building a new heaven that weird symbol of the oldest and most recent history of philosophers on earth everyone who at some time or another has built a new heaven found the power to do that first in his own hell lets condense this whole fact into a short formula the philosophical spirit always had to begin by disguising himself wrapping himself in a cocoon of the previously established forms of the contemplative man as priest magician prophet generally as a religious man in order to make any kind of life at all possible the ascetic ideal for a long time served the philosopher as a form in which he could appear as a condition for his existence he had to play the role in order to be able to be a philosopher and he had to believe in what he was doing in order to play that role the characteristically detached stance of philosophers something which denied the world was hostile to life had no faith in the senses and was free of sensuality which was maintained right up to the most recent times and thus became valued as the essence of the philosophical attitudethat is above all a necessary consequence of the conditions under which in general philosophy arose and survived in fact for the longest time on earth philosophy would not have been at all possible without an ascetic cover and costume without an ascetic misunderstanding of the self to put the matter explicitly up to the most recent times the ascetic priest has provided the repellent and dark caterpillar form which was the only one in which philosophy could live and creep around has that really changed is that colourful and dangerous winged creature that spirit which this caterpillar hid within itself at last really been released and allowed out into the light thanks to a sunnier warmer brighter world nowadays do we have sufficient pride daring bravery selfcertainty spiritual will desire to assume responsibility and freedom of the will so that from now on the philosopher is possible on earth only now that we have taken a look at the ascetic priest can we seriously get at our problem of what ascetic ideals meanonly now does it become serious from this point on we confront the actual representative of seriousness what does all seriousness meanthis even more fundamental question perhaps lies already on our lips a question for physiologists naturally but nonetheless one will we still evade for the moment in this ideal the ascetic priest preserves not merely his faith but also his will his power his interest his right to existence stands and falls with that ideal no wonder that here we run into a fearful opponent given of course that we were people antagonistic to that idealan opponent of the sort who fights against those who deny the ideal on the other hand it is from the outset improbable that such an interesting stance to our problem will be particularly beneficial the ascetic priest will hardly in himself prove the most successful defender of his ideal for the same reason that a woman habitually fails when its a matter of defending woman as such to say nothing of his being able to provide the most objective assessment of and judgment about the controversy we are dealing with here rather than having to fear that he will refute usthis much is clear enoughwell have to help him defend himself against us the idea being contested at this point is the value of our lives in the eyes of ascetic priests this same life together with what belongs to it nature the world the collective sphere of being and transience they set up in relation to an existence of a totally different kind a relationship characterized by opposition and mutual exclusion except where life somehow turns against itself denies itself in the case of an ascetic life living counts as a bridge over to that other existence the ascetic treats life as an incorrect road where we must finally go backwards right to the place where it begins or as a misconception which man refutes by his actionsor should refute for he demands that people go with him where he can he enforces his evaluation of existence whats the meaning of that such a monstrous way of assessing value does not stand inscribed in human history as something exceptional and curious it is one of the most widespread and enduring extant facts if we read from a distant star the block capital script of our earthly existence might perhaps lead one to conclude that the earth is the inherently ascetic star a corner for discontented arrogant and repellent creatures incapable of ridding themselves of a deep dissatisfaction with themselves with the earth with all living creatures who inflict harm on themselves for the pleasure of inflicting harmevidently their single pleasure we should consider how regularly how commonly how in almost all ages the ascetic priest makes an appearance he does not belong to one single race he flourishes everywhere he grows from all levels of society and its not the case that he breeds and replants his way of assessing value somehow through biological inheritancethe opposite is much closer to the truthgenerally speaking a deep instinct forbids him from reproducing there must be a highorder necessity which makes this species hostile to life always grow again and flourish life itself must have some interest in not having such a type of selfcontradiction die out for an ascetic life is such a selfcontradiction here a resentment without equal is in control something with an insatiable instinct and will to power which wants to become master not over something in life but over life itself over its deepest strongest most basic conditions here an attempt is being made to use ones power to block up the sources of that power here one directs ones gaze with a green malice against ones inherent physiological health particularly against its means of expressionbeauty and joywhile one experiences and seeks for a feeling of pleasure in mistrust atrophy pain accident ugliness voluntary loss selfdenial selfflagellation selfsacrifice all this is paradoxical to the highest degree here we stand in front of a dichotomy which essentially wants to be a dichotomy which enjoys itself in the midst of this suffering and gets even more selfaware and more triumphant in proportion to the decrease in its own prerequisite the physiological capacity for life triumph in the ultimate agonyunder this supreme sign the ascetic ideal has always fought inside this riddle of seduction in this picture of delight and torment it sees its highest light its salvation its final victory crux nux lux cross nut lightfor the ascetic ideal these are all one thing given that such a living desire for contradiction and hostility to nature is used to practice philosophy on what will it discharge its most inner arbitrary power it will do that on something it perceives with the greatest certainty as something real it will seek out error precisely where the essential instinct for life has established its most unconditional truth for example it will demote physical life to an illusion as the ascetics of the vedanta philosophy did similarly they will treat pain the multiplicity of things the whole ideational opposition between subject and object as error nothing but error to deny faith in their own ego to deny their own realitywhat a triumphand not just over the senses over appearances but a much loftier triumph an overpowering of and act of cruelty against reason a process in which the highest peak of delight occurs when the ascetic selfcontempt and the selfmockery of reason proclaims there is a kingdom of truth and being but reason is expressly excluded from it by the way even in the kantian idea of the intelligible character of things there is still something of this old greedy ascetic dichotomy which loves to turn reason against reason for the intelligible character with kant means a sort of composition of things about which the intellect understands just enough to know that it is wholly and completely unintelligible to the intellect but as people who seek knowledge the last thing we should do is be ungrateful for such determined reversals of customary perspectives and evaluations with which the spirit has for so long raged against itself with such apparent wickedness and futility to use this for once to see differently the will to see things differently is no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its coming objectivity and not in the sense of disinterested contemplation which is conceptual nonsense but as the capability of having power over ones positive and negative arguments and to raise them and dispose of them so that one knows how to make the various perspectives and interpretations of emotions useful for knowledge from now on my philosophical gentlemen let us protect ourselves better from the dangerous old conceptual fantasy which posits a pure willless painless timeless subject of cognition lets guard ourselves against the tentacles of such contradictory ideas as pure reason absolute spirituality knowledge in itselfthose things which demand that we imagine an eye which simply cant be imagined an eye without any direction at all in which the active and interpretative forces are supposed to stop or be absentthe very things through which seeing first becomes seeing something hence these things always demand from the eye something conceptually empty and absurd the only seeing we have is seeing from a perspective the only knowledge we have is knowledge from a perspective the more emotional affects we allow to be expressed in words concerning something the more eyes different eyes we know how to train on the same thing the more complete our idea of this thing our objectivity will be but to eliminate the will in general to suspend all our emotions without exceptioneven if we were capable of thatwhat would that be wouldnt we call that castrating the intellect but lets go back the sort of selfcontradiction which seems to be present in ascetic people life opposing life isthis much is clearphysiologically and not only physiologically consideredsimply absurd it can only be apparent it must be some kind of temporary expression an interpretation formula make up a psychological misunderstanding of something whose real nature could not be understood for a long time could not for a long time be describeda mere word caught in an old gap in human understanding so let me counter that briefly with the facts of the matter the ascetic ideal arises out of the instinct for protection and salvation in a degenerating life seeking to keep itself going by any means and struggling for its existence it indicates a partial physiological inhibition and exhaustion against which those deepest instincts for living which still remain intact continuously fight on with new methods and innovations the ascetic ideal is one such method the facts are thus precisely the opposite of what those who honour this ideal claimlife is struggling in that ideal and by means of that ideal with death and against death the ascetic ideal is a manoeuvre for the preservation of life to the extent that this ideal as history teaches us could prevail over men and become powerful particularly wherever civilization and the taming of humans manifested themselves it expresses an important fact the pathological nature of the earlier form of human beings at least those human beings whod been tamed and the physiological struggle of men against death more precisely against weariness with life against exhaustion against desire for the end the ascetic priest is the incarnation of the desire for another state of being a life somewhere elseindeed the highest stage of this desire its characteristic zeal and passion but the very power of this desire is the chain which binds him here thats what turns him into a tool which has to work to create more favourable conditions for living here and for living as a human being with this very power he keeps the whole herd of failures discontents delinquents unfortunates all sorts of people who inherently suffer focused on existence because instinctively he goes ahead of them as their herdsman you understand already what i mean this ascetic priest this apparent enemy of living this man who denieshe belongs with all the great conserving and affirming forces of life to what can we ascribe this pathology for the human being is more ill less certain more changeable more insecure than any other animaltheres no doubt about that he is the sick animal where does that come from to be sure he has also dared more innovated more defied more and demanded more from fate than all the other animals combined he is the great experimenter with himself unhappy and dissatisfied who struggles for ultimate mastery with animals nature and godsstill unconquered always a man of the future who never gets any rest from his own inner powers so that his future relentlessly burrows like a thorn into the flesh of his present why should such a brave and rich animal also not be the animal in most danger the one which of all sick animals suffers the most lengthy and intense illness human beings often enough get fed up there are entire epidemics of this process of getting fed up for example around at the time of the dance of death but even this disgust this exhaustion this dissatisfaction with himselfall this comes out of him so powerfully that it immediately becomes a new chain the no which he speaks to life brings to light as if through a magic spell an abundance of more tender yeses even when he injures himself this master of destruction and selfdestruction it is the wound itself which later forces him to live on the more normal this pathology is among human beingsand we cannot deny its normalitythe higher we should esteem the rare cases of spiritual and physical power humanitys strokes of luck and the more strongly successful people should protect themselves from the most poisonous air the atmosphere of illness do people do that sick people are the greatest danger for healthy people for strong people disaster does not come from the strongest but from the weakest are we aware of that if we consider the big picture we shouldnt want any diminution of the fear we have of human beings for this fear compels the strong people to be strong and in some circumstances terrible that fear sustains the successful types of people what we should fear what has a disastrous effect unlike any other would not be a great fear of humanity but a great loathing for humanity or for the same reasons a great pity for mankind if these both these were one day to mate then something most weird would at once appear in the world the ultimate will of man his will to nothingness nihilism as a matter of fact a great deal of preparation has gone on for this union whoever possesses not only a nose to smell with but also eyes and ears senses almost everywhere no matter where he steps nowadays an atmosphere something like that of an insane asylum or hospital im speaking as usual of peoples cultural surroundings of every kind of europe there is right here on this earth the invalids are the great danger to humanitynot the evil men not the predatory animals those people who are from the outset failures oppressed brokenthey are the ones the weakest who most undermine life among human beings who in the most perilous way poison and question our trust in life in humanity in ourselves where can we escape that downcast glance with which people carry their deep sorrow that reversed gaze of the man originally born to fail which betrays how such a man speaks to himself that gaze which is a sigh i wish i could be someone elsethats what this glance sighs but there is no hope here i am who i am how could i detach myself from myself and yet ive had enough of myself on such a ground of contempt for oneself a truly swampy ground grows every weed every poisonous growthall of them so small so hidden so dishonest so sweet here the worms of angry and resentful feelings swarm here the air stinks of secrets and duplicity here are constantly spun the nets of the most malicious conspiraciesthose who are suffering and plotting against successful and victorious people here the appearance of the victor is despised and what dishonesty not to acknowledge this hatred as hatred what an extravagance of large words and attitudes what an art of decent slander these failureswhat noble eloquence flows from their lips how much sugary slimy humble resignation swims in their eyes what do they really want at least to make a show of justice love wisdom superioritythats the ambition of these lowest people these invalids and how clever such an ambition makes people for lets admire the skilful counterfeiting with which people here imitate the trademarks of virtue even its resounding tinkle the golden sound of virtue theyve now taken a lease on virtue entirely for themselves these weak and hopeless invalidstheres no doubt about that we alone are the good men the just menthats how they speak we alone are the homines bonae voluntatis men of good will they wander around among us like personifications of reproach like warnings to us as if health success strength pride and a feeling of power were inherently depraved things for which people must atone some day atone bitterly how they thirst to be hangmen among them there are plenty of people disguised as judges seeking revenge they always have the word justice in their mouths like poisonous saliva with their mouths always pursed constantly ready to spit at anything which does not look discontented and goes on its way in good spirits among them there is no lack of that most disgusting species of vain people the lying monsters who aim to present themselves as beautiful souls and carry off to market their ruined sensuality wrapped up in verse and other swaddling clothes as purity of heartthe species of selfgratifying moral masturbators the desire of sick people to present some form or other of superiority their instinct for secret paths leading to a tyranny over the healthywhere can we not find it this very will to power of the weakest people the sick woman in particular no one outdoes her in refined ways to rule others to exert pressure to tyrannize for that purpose the sick woman spares nothing living or dead she digs up again the most deeply buried things the bogos say the woman is a hyena take a look into the background of every family every corporation every communityeverywhere you see the struggle of the sick against the healthy a quiet struggle for the most part with a little poison powder with needling with deceitful expressions of long suffering but now and then also with that sick mans pharisaic tactic of loud gestures whose favourite role is noble indignation it likes to make itself heard all the way into the consecrated rooms of science that hoarse booming indignation of the pathologically ill hound the biting insincerity and rage of such noble pharisees once again i remind readers who have ears of eugene duhring that apostle of revenge from berlin who in todays germany makes the most indecent and most revolting use of moralistic gibberishduhring the preeminent moral braggart we have nowadays even among those like him the antisemites they are all men of resentment these physiologically impaired and wormeaten men a totally quivering earthly kingdom of subterranean revenge inexhaustible insatiable in its outbursts against the fortunate and equally in its masquerades of revenge its pretexts for revenge when would they attain their ultimate most refined most sublime triumph of revenge undoubtedly if they could succeed in pushing their own wretchedness all misery in general into the consciences of the fortunate so that the latter one day might begin to be ashamed of their good fortune and perhaps would say to themselves its a shameful to be fortunate theres too much misery but there could be no greater and more fateful misunderstanding than if through this process the fortunate the successful the powerful in body and spirit should start to doubt their right to happiness away with this twisted world away with this disgraceful softening of feelings that the invalids do not make the healthy sickand that would be such a softeningthat should surely be ruling point of view on earth but that would require above everything that the healthy remain separated from the sick protected even from the gaze of sick people so that they dont confuse themselves with the ill or would it perhaps be their assignment to attend on the sick or be their doctors but they could not misjudge or negate their work more seriouslysomething higher should never demean itself by becoming the tool of something lower the pathos of distance should keep the work of the two groups forever separate their right to exist the privilege of a bell with a perfect ring in comparison to one that is cracked and off key is a thousand times greater they alone are guarantors of the future they alone stand as pledge for humanitys future whatever they can do whatever they should dothe sick can never be able to do and should not do but if they are to be able to do what they should do how can they have the freedom to make themselves the doctor the consoler the person who cures the invalids and therefore lets have fresh air fresh air in any case lets keep away from the neighbourhood of all cultural insane asylums and hospitals and for that lets have good companionship our companionship or loneliness if thats necessary but by all means lets stay away from the foul stink of inner rotting and of muck from sick worms in that way my friends we can defend ourselves at least for a little while against the two nastiest scourges which may be lying in wait precisely for usagainst a great disgust with humanity and against a great pity for humanity if youve gasped the full profundity of this and i require that you grasp deeply right here and understand profoundly of the extent to which it simply cannot be the task of healthy people to attend to the sick to make sick people well then theres one more necessary matter you understandthe necessity for doctors and nurses who are themselves ill now we understand the meaning of the ascetic priestwere holding it in both hands we need to look on the ascetic priest as the preordained healer shepherd and advocate of the sick herd in that way we can for the first time understand his immense historical mission ruling over suffering people is his kingdom his instinct instructs him to do that and in that he has his very own art his mastery his sort of success he must be sick himself he must be fundamentally related to the sick and those who go astray in order to understand them in order to be understood by them but he must also be strong master over himself even more than over others that is undamaged in his will to power so that he inspires confidence and fear from the invalids so that he can be their support resistance protection compulsion discipline tyrant and god he has to defend his herd but against whom against the healthy people undoubtedly but also against their envy of the healthy he has to be the natural opponent and critic of all rough stormy unchecked hard violent predatory health and power the priest is the first form of the more refined animal which despises more easily than it hates he will not be spared having to conduct wars with predatory animals wars of cunning of the spirit rather than of force as is obvious for that purpose in certain circumstances it will be necessary for him to develop himself into a new type of beast of prey or at least to represent himself as such a beast with a new animal ferocity in which the polar bear the sleek cold and patient tiger and not least of all the fox seem to be combined in a unity which attracts as well as inspires fear if need compels him to do this he will walk even in the midst of the other predatory animals with the seriousness of a bear venerable clever cold and with a duplicitous superiority as the herald and oracle of more mysterious forces determined to sow this ground where he can with suffering conflict selfcontradiction and only too sure of his art to become the master over the suffering at all times theres no doubt he brings with him ointments and balm but in order to be a doctor he first has to inflict wounds then while he eases the pain caused by the wound at the same time he poisons the woundfor that is above all what he knows how to do this magician and animal trainer around whom everything healthy necessarily becomes ill and everything sick necessarily becomes tame in fact he defends his sick herd well enough this strange shepherdhe protects them against themselves against the smouldering wickedness scheming and maliciousness in the herd itself against all those addictions and illnesses characteristic of their dealings with each other he fights shrewdly hard and secretly against the anarchy and selfdissolution which start up all the time within the herd in which the most dangerously explosive stuff resentment is constantly piling and piling up to detonate this explosive material in such a way that it does not blow up the herd and its shepherd that is his essential work of art and also his most important function if we want to sum up the value of the priestly existence in the shortest slogan we could at once put it like this the priest is the person who alters the direction of resentment for every suffering person instinctively seeks a cause for his suffering or more precisely an agent or even more precisely a guilty agent capable of sufferingin short he seeks some living person on whom he can on some pretext or other unload his feelings either in fact or in effigy for the discharge of feelings is the most important way a suffering man seeks relief that is some anaestheticits his instinctively desired narcotic against all sorts of torments in my view only here can we find the true physiological cause of resentment revenge and things related to them in a longing for some anaesthetic against pain through ones emotions people usually look for this cause most incorrectly in my view in the defensive striking back a merely reactive protective measure a reflex movement in the event of some sudden damage and threat of the sort a decapitated frog still makes in order to get rid of corrosive acid but the difference is fundamental in one case people want to prevent suffering further damage in the other case people want to deaden a tormenting secret pain which is becoming unendurable by means of a more violent emotion of some kind and for the moment at least to drive it from their consciousness for that they need some emotional affect as unruly an emotional affect as possible and in order to stimulate that they need the best pretext available someone or other must be guilty of the fact that i am bad this sort of conclusion is characteristic of all sick peopleall the more so if the real cause of their sense that they are bad the physiological cause remains hidden it can lie somewhere in an illness of the nervus sympathicus sympathetic nerves or in an excessive secretion of gall or in a lack of potassium sulphate and phosphate in the blood or in some pressure in the lower abdomen which blocks the circulation or in a degeneration of the ovaries and so on suffering people all have a horrible willingness and capacity for inventing pretexts for painful emotional feelings they already enjoy their suspicions their brooding over bad actions and apparent damage they ransack the entrails of their past and present looking for dark and dubious stories in which they are free to feast on an agonizing suspicion and to get intoxicated on their own poisonous anger they rip open the oldest wounds they bleed themselves to death from longhealed scars they turn friends wives children and anyone else who is closest to them into criminals i am suffering someone or other must be to blame for thatthat how every sick sheep thinks but his shepherd the ascetic priest says to him thats right my sheep someone must be to blame for that but you yourself are this very person you yourself are the only one to blame you alone are to blame for yourself that is clever enough and false enough but one thing at least is attained by that as i have said the direction of resentment has been changed by now you will have guessed what according to my ideas the healing artistic instinct for life at least has attempted with the ascetic priest and why he had to use a temporary tyranny of paradoxical and illogical ideas like guilt sins sinfulness degeneration damnation to make sick people to a certain extent harmless to enable the incurable to destroy themselves by their own actions to redirect the resentment of the mildly ill sternly back onto themselves theres one thing necessary and to utilize the bad instincts of all suffering people to serve the purpose of selfdiscipline selfmonitoring selfconquest as is obvious this kind of medication a merely emotional medication has nothing to do with a real cure for an illness in a physiological sense we should never assert that the instinct for life has any sort of chance or intention to heal itself in this way a kind of pressure to come together and organize the invalids on one side the word church is the popular name for this some form of temporary guarantee for the more healthy successful people the ones more completely fulfilled on another sideand in the process the creation of rift between the healthy and sickfor a long time thats all there was and that was a lot it was a great deal in this essay as you see i proceed on an assumption which so far as the readers i require are concerned i do not have to provethat the sinfulness of human beings is not a matter of fact but is much rather only the interpretation of a factual condition that is of a bad psychological mood with the latter seen from a moralreligious perspective something which is no longer binding on us the fact that someone feels himself guilty or sinful does not in itself yet demonstrate that he is justified in feeling like that just as the mere fact that someone feels healthy does not mean that he is healthy people should remember the famous witch trials at that time the most perspicacious and philanthropic judges had no doubt that they were dealing with guilt the witches themselves had no doubts about that point nonetheless there was no guilt to express that assumption in broader terms i consider that spiritual pain itself is not in general a fact but only an interpretation a causal interpretation of facts which up to that point have not been precisely formulated and thus something that is still completely up in the air and scientifically emptybasically a fat word set in place of a spindly question mark to put the matter crudely when someone cannot cope with a spiritual pain that has nothing to do with his soul its more likely something to do with his belly speaking crudely as i said but in saying that im not expressing the slightest wish to be crudely heard or crudely understood a strong and successful man digests his experiences his actions including his evil actions as he digests his meals even when he has to swallow down some hard mouthfuls if he is unable to finish with an experience this kind of indigestion is just as much a physiological matter as the other oneand in many cases in fact only one of the consequences of that other one with such an view a person can just between ourselves still remain the strongest opponent of materialism but is he really a doctor this ascetic priest we already understand the extent to which he can hardly be permitted to call himself a doctor no matter how much he likes feeling that he is a saviour and allowing himself to be honoured as a saviour but he fights only against suffering itself the unhappiness of the suffering person not against its cause not against the essential sickness this must constitute our most fundamental objection to priestly medication but if for once we look at things from the perspective which only the priest adopts and understands then it will not be easy for us to limit our amazement at all the things he has noticed looked for and found by seeing things in that manner the alleviation of suffering every kind of consolationthat manifests itself as his particular genius he has understood his task as consoler with so much innovation and has selected the means for that so spontaneously and so fearlessly we might call christianity in particular a huge treasure house of clever forms of consolationthere are so many pleasant soothing and narcotizing things piled up in it and for this purpose it takes so many dangerous and audacious chances it shows such sophistication so much southern european refinement especially when it guesses what kind of emotional stimulant can overcome at least for a while the deep depression leaden exhaustion and black sorrow of the physiologically impaired for generally speaking with all great religions the main issue concerns the fight against a certain endemic exhaustion and heaviness we can from the outset assume as probable that from time to time in particular places on the earth a feeling of physiological inhibition must master wide masses of people but because of a lack of knowledge about physiology it does not enter peoples consciousness as something physiological so they look for and attempt to find its cause and remedy only in psychology and morality this in fact is my most general formula for whatever is commonly called a religion such a feeling of inhibition can have a varied ancestry for instance it can be the result of crossbreeding between very different races or between classesfor classes also always express differences in origin and race nineteenthcentury european weltschmerz pain at the state of the world and pessimism are essentially the consequence of an irrational sudden mixing of the classes or it can be caused by incorrect emigrationa race caught in a climate for which its powers of adaptation are not sufficient the case of the indians in india or by the influence of the age and tiredness of the race parisian pessimism from on or by an incorrect diet the alcoholism of the middle ages the inanity of vegetarians who of course have on their side the authority of squire christopher in shakespeare or by degeneration in the blood malaria syphilis and things like that german depression after the thirty years war which spread bad diseases in an epidemic through half of germany and thus prepared the ground for german servility german timidity in such a case a war in the grand style against the feeling of unhappiness will always be attempted lets briefly go over its most important practices and forms here i leave quite out of account as seems reasonable the typical war of the philosophers against this feeling of unhappiness which always has a habit of appearing at the same timethat war is interesting enough but too absurd with too little practical significance full of cobwebs and loafing aroundas for example when pain is to be shown an error on the nave assumption that the pain must disappear as soon as it is recognized as a errorbut lo and behold something prevents it from disappearing first people fight that domineering unhappiness with means which in general set our feeling for life at their lowest point where possible there is generally no more willing no more desire they stay away from everything which creates an emotional affect which makes blood no salt in the diet the hygiene of the fakir they dont love they dont hateequanimitythey dont take revenge they dont get wealthy they dont work they beg where possible no women or as few women as possible with respect to spiritual matters pascals principle il faut sabtir its necessary to turn oneself into an animal the result expressed in moralpsychological terms is selflessness sanctification expressed in physiological terms hypnotizingthe attempt to attain for human beings something approaching what winter hibernation is for some kinds of animals and what summer sleep is for many plants in hot climates the minimum consumption and processing of material stuff which can still sustain life but which does not actually enter consciousness for this purpose an astonishing amount of human energy has been expended has it all gone for nothing we should not entertain the slightest doubts that with a rigorous training like this such sportsmen of holiness which almost all populations have in abundance at all times in fact found a real release from what they were fighting against with the help of their systemic methods for hypnosis in countless cases they were released from that deep physiological depression thats the reason their methodology belongs with the most universal ethnological facts for the same reason we have no authority for considering such an intentional starving of ones desires and of ones physical well being in itself symptoms of insanity the way a clumsy kind of roastbeefeating free spirit and squire christopher like to do its much more the case that it opens or can open the way to all sorts of spiritual disruptions to inner light for example as with hesychasts on mount athos to hallucinating sounds and shapes to sensual outpourings and ecstasies of sensuality the history of st theresa its obvious that the interpretation which has been given for conditions of this sort by those afflicted with them has always been as effusively false as possible people should not fail to catch the tone of totally convincing gratitude ringing out even in the will to such a form of interpretation they always value the highest state redemption itself that finally attained collective hypnosis and quietness as an inherent mystery which cannot be adequately expressed even by the highest symbols as a rest and return home to the basis of things as an emancipation from all delusions as knowledge as truth as being as the removal of all goals all wishes all acts and thus as a place beyond good and evil good and evil says the buddhist are both fetters the perfect one became master over both whats done and whats not done says the man who believes in the vedanta give him no pain as a wise man he shakes good and evil off himself his kingdom suffers no more from any deed good and evilhe has transcended bothan entirely indian conception whether brahman or buddhist neither in the indian nor in the christian way of thinking is this redemption considered attainable through virtue through moral improvementno matter how high a value they place on virtue as a form of hypnotism people should note this pointit corresponds incidentally to the plain facts that on this point they kept to the truth might perhaps be considered the best piece of realism in the three largest religions which apart from this are so fundamentally concerned with moralizing the man who knows has no duties redemption does not come about through an increase in virtue for it consists of unity with brahma who is incapable of any increase in perfection even less does it come through a lessening of ones faults for the brahma unity with whom creates redemption is eternally purethese passages from the commentary of shankara are cited by the first real scholar of indian philosophy in europe my friend paul deussen so we want to honour redemption in the great religions however it will be a little difficult for us to remain serious about the way these people whove grown too weary of life even to dream value deep sleepthat is deep sleep as an access to the brahma as an achieved unio mystica mysterious union with god on this subject the oldest and most venerable scripture states when he is soundly and completely asleep and is in a state of perfect calm so that he is not seeing any more dream images at that moment dear ones united with his being he has gone into himself now that he has been embraced by a form of his knowing self he has no consciousness any more of what is outer or inner over this bridge comes neither night nor day nor old age nor death nor suffering nor good works nor evil works similarly the believers in the most profound of the three great religions say in deep sleep the soul lifts itself up out of the body goes into the highest light and moves out in its own form there it is the highest spirit itself which wanders around while it jokes and plays and enjoys itself whether with women or with carriages or with friends there it no longer thinks back to its bodily appendages to which the prana the breath of life is harnessed like a draught animal to a cart nevertheless we need to keep in mind here as in the case of redemption that no matter how great the splendour of oriental exaggeration what this states is basically the same evaluation which was made by that clear cool greekcool but suffering epicurus the hypnotic feeling of nothingness the silence of the deepest sleep in short the loss of sufferingsomething which suffering and fundamentally disgruntled people have to consider their highest good their value of values and which they must appraise as positive and experience as the positive in itself with the same logic of feeling in all pessimistic religions nothingness is called god but against this condition of depression a different and certainly easier training is tried far more often than such a hypnotic collective deadening of the sensibilities of the ability to experience pain for this method requires rare powers above all courage contempt for opinion and intellectual stoicism this different training is mechanical activity theres no doubt whatsoever that this can significantly alleviate a suffering existence today we call this activity somewhat dishonestly the blessings of work the relief comes from the fact that the interest of the suffering person is basically diverted from his suffering that some action and then another action are always entering his consciousness thus leaving little space for suffering for its narrow this room of human consciousness mechanical activity and whats associated with itlike absolute regularity meticulous and mindless obedience a style of life set once and for all filling in time a certain allowance for indeed training in impersonality in forgetting oneself in incuria sui no care for oneself how fundamentally how delicately the ascetic priest knew how to use them in the struggle with suffering especially when it involved the suffering people of the lower classes working slaves or prisoners or women most of whom are simultaneously bothworking slaves and prisoners what was needed was a little more than the minor art of changing names of rechristening so as to make those people in future see a favour some relative good fortune in things they hated the slaves discontent with his lot in any case was not invented by the priests an even more valuable tool in the battle against depression is prescribing a small pleasure which is readily accessible and can be made habitual people frequently use this medication in combination with the one just mentioned the most common form in which pleasure is prescribed in this way as a cure is the pleasure in creating pleasure as in showing kindness giving presents providing relief helping encouraging trusting praising awarding prizes the ascetic priest orders love of ones neighbour in so doing he is basically prescribing an arousal of the strongest most lifeaffirming drive even if only in the most cautious dosesthe will to power the happiness which comes from the smallest feeling of superiority which all doing good being useful helping and awarding prizes brings with it is the most plentiful way of providing consolation which the physiologically impaired habitually use provided that they have been well advised in a different situation they harm each other doing so of course in obedience to the same fundamental instinct if we look for the beginnings of christianity in the roman world we find organizations growing up for mutual support combinations of the poor and sick for burial on the lowest levels of contemporary society in which that major way of combating depression the minor joys which habitually develop out of mutual demonstrations of kindness were consciously employed perhaps at the time this was something new a real discovery such a calling out for the will to mutual assistance for the formation of the herd for a community for a congregation must summon up again if only in the smallest way an aroused will to power and lead to new and much greater outbursts in the fight against depression the development of the herd is an essential step and a victory by growing the community also reinforces in the individual a new interest which often enough raises him up over the most personal features of his bad disposition his dislike of himself geulincxs despectio sui contempt for oneself all sick pathological people in their desire to shake off a stifling lack of enthusiasm and a feeling of weakness instinctively strive for the organization of a herd the ascetic priest senses this instinct and promotes it where there is a herd its the instinct of weakness which has willed the herd and the cleverness of the priest which has organized it we should not overlook the following point through natural necessity strong people strive to separate from each other just as much as weak people strive to be together when the former unite that happens only at the prospect of an aggressive combined action and a collective satisfaction of their will to power but with considerable resistance from the individual conscience by contrast the latter organize themselves collectively taking pleasure precisely in this collective their instinct is satisfied in the same way that the instinct of those born masters ie the solitary man of the predatory animal species is basically irritated and upset by organization under every oligarchyall history teaches usalways is concealed the craving for tyranny every oligarchy is constantly trembling with the tension which every individual in it necessarily has inside him to remain master of this craving that was the case for example with the greeks plato provides evidence of this in a hundred passagesplato who understood his peersand himself the ascetic priests methods which we learned about earlierthe collective deadening of the feeling for life mechanical activity minor joys above all the joy in loving ones neighbour the organization of the herd the awakening of the feeling of power in the community as a result of which the dissatisfaction of the individual with himself is drowned out by his pleasure in the progress of the communitythese things are measured by modern standards his innocent methods in the war against unhappiness but now lets turn our attention to more interesting matters to his guilty methods here there is always only one thing involved some kind of excess of feeling employed as the most effective anaesthetic against stifling crippling enduring pain for that reason the priests powers of innovation have been tireless in addressing this one question in particular how do people reach emotional excess that sounds harsh its clear enough that it would sound more appealing and perhaps please our ears better if i said something like the ascetic priest has always used the enthusiasm which lies in all strong emotional affects but why keep caressing the mollycoddled ears of our modern delicate sensibilities why should we for our part retreat even one step back from the hypocrisy of their vocabulary doing something like that would make us psychologists active hypocritesapart from the fact that it would be disgusting for a psychologist today if he has good taste anywhere others might say honesty its because he detests that disgraceful moralizing way of talking which effectively covers in slime all modern judgments about human beings and things we must not deceive ourselves in this business the most characteristic feature which forms modern souls and modern books is not lying but the ingrained innocence in their moralistic lying to have to discover this innocence all over the place is perhaps the most repellent part of all the by no means harmless tasks which nowadays a psychologist has to undertake it is a part of our great dangera path that perhaps takes us in particular to a great revulsion i have no doubt about what single purpose will be served or can be served in a coming world by everything modern including modern books provided that they last which of course we need not fear and provided that there will one day be a later world with a stronger harder and healthier taste they will serve as emetics thanks to their moralistic sugar and falsity their innermost femininity which likes to call itself idealism and which at all events has faith in idealism today our educated people our good people dont tell lies thats true but thats no reason to respect them the real lie the genuine resolute honest lie people should listen to plato on its value for them would be something far too demanding too strong it would require what people are not allowed to demand of themselves that they opened up their eyes and looked at themselves so that they would know how to differentiate between the true and false in themselves but they are fit only for ignoble lies everyone today who feels that he is a good man is completely incapable of taking a stand on any issue at all other than with dishonest falsenessan abysmal falsity which is however an innocent truehearted blueeyed and virtuous falsity these good peoplecollectively they are now utterly moralized and so far as their honesty is concerned theyve been disgraced and ruined for all eternity who among them could endure even one truth about human beings or to ask the question more precisely who among them could bear a true biography here are a couple of indications lord byron recorded some very personal things about himself but thomas moore was too good for them he burned his friends papers dr gwinner the executor of schopenhauers will is supposed to have done the same for schopenhauer also recorded some things about himself and also against himself eis auton the capable american thayer who wrote beethovens biography all of a sudden stopped his workat some point or other this venerable and nave life reached a point where he could no longer continue moral what intelligent man nowadays would write an honest word about himself he would already have to be a member of the order of daredevils we have been promised an autobiography of richard wagner who has any doubts that it will be a prudent autobiography lets remember again the comical horror which the catholic priest janssen aroused in germany with his incomprehensibly bland and harmless picture of the german reformation how would people react if someone explained this movement differently for once if for once a true psychologist with spiritual strength and not a shrewd indulgence toward strength pictured a true luther for us no longer a man with the moralistic simplicity of a country parson no longer a man with the sweet and considerate modesty of a protestant historian but someone with the fearlessness of a taine parenthetically the germans have finally produced a sufficiently beautiful classical type of such shrewd indulgence they can classify him as one of their own count him as one of their possessionsnamely leopold ranke that born classical advocate of every causa fortior stronger cause the shrewdest of all the shrewd objective realists but you will already have grasped what im getting at all in all thats surely reason enough why we psychologists nowadays cannot rid ourselves of a certain distrust in ourselves we are also probably too good for the work we do we are probably also sacrificial victims and prey made sick by this contemporary taste for moralizing no matter how much we feel were its criticsit probably infects even us as well what was that diplomat warning about when he addressed his colleagues gentlemen let us mistrust our first impulses above all he said they are almost always good thats how every psychologist today should speak to his colleagues and so we come back to our problem which in fact requires a certain rigour from us especially some distrust of our first impulses the ascetic ideal in the service of intentional emotional excesswith these nine words whoever remembers the previous essay will already have a preliminary sense in summary form of the basic content of what im now presenting to remove the human soul for once from its entire frame to immerse it in terror frost glowing embers and joys of that kind so that it rids itself as if with a bolt of lightning of all the petty trivialities of lack of interest apathy and irritation what paths lead to this goal and which of them is the most reliable all the greatest emotional affects basically have this capacity provided they discharge themselves suddenlyanger fear lust revenge hope triumph despair cruelty and the ascetic priest has in fact without a second thought taken the whole pack of wild hounds in human beings into his service and let loose one of them at one time another at another time always for the same purpose to wake human beings up out of their long sadness to chase away at least for a while their stifling pain their tentative misery always covered up in a religious interpretation and justification every emotional excess of this sort demands payment laterthats selfevidentit makes sick people sicker thus this way of providing a remedy for pain measured by modern standards is a guilty method however to be fair we must insist all the more first that it was used in good conscience that the ascetic priest prescribed it with the deepest faith in its utility indeed its indispensabilityhe himself often enough almost fell apart from the misery he createdand second that the vehement physiological revenge of such excesses perhaps even psychic disturbances basically does not really contradict the whole meaning of this kind of medication which as ive pointed out above was not designed to heal sick people but to fight their enervating depression to alleviate and anaesthetize it with this method that goal was attained the main idea which the ascetic priest helps himself to in order to let that kind of disorienting ecstatic music ring out in the human soul as everyone knows stems from the fact that he makes use of the feeling of guilt the previous essay indicated in brief the origin of this feeling as a part of animal psychology nothing more the feeling of guilt we encountered there in its raw state as it were in the hands of the priest this true artist in guilt feelings it first acquired a formand what a form sinfor thats how the priests new interpretation of the animal bad conscience ran cruelty turned back insidehas been the greatest event in the history of the sick soul so far in it we have the most dangerous and the most fateful artistic work of religious interpretation the human being suffering from himself somehowat any rate psychologicallysomething like an animal barred up in a cage confused about why this has happened and what purpose it serves longing for reasonsreasons provide relieflonging also for treatments and for narcotics finally discussed the matter with one who also knew about hidden things then lo and behold he gets a hint he gets the first hint about the cause of his suffering from his magician from the ascetic priest he is to seek this cause in himself in his guilt in a piece of the past he is to understand even his own suffering as a condition of punishment he heard and he understoodthis unfortunate man now things stand with him as with a hen with a line drawn around it hes not coming outside this circular line again the sick man is turned into the sinner and now for a couple of millennia people have not rid themselves of the look of this new sick man the sinner will people ever want to be rid of him no matter where we look we see everywhere the hypnotic glance of the sinner who always moves in one direction in the direction of guilt as the single cause of suffering everywhere the bad conscience this horrifying animal to use luthers words everywhere the past regurgitated the fact distorted the green eye cast on all action everywhere the desire to misunderstand suffering turned into the meaning of life with suffering reinterpreted into feelings of guilt fear and punishment everywhere the scourge the hair shirt the starving body remorse everywhere the sinners breaking himself on the terrible torture wheel of a restless conscience greedy for its own sickness everywhere silent torment extreme fear the agony of the tortured heart spasms of an unknown joy the cry for redemption as a matter of fact with this system of procedures the old depression heaviness and exhaustion were basically overthrown life became very interesting once again lively always lively sleepless glowing charred exhausted and yet not tiredthats how man looked the sinner who was initiated into these mysteries this grand old magician in the war against the lack of excitement the ascetic priesthe had apparently won his kingdom had come now people no longer moaned against pain they longed for pain more pain more painthats been the demanding cry of his disciples and initiates for centuries every excess of feeling which brought grief everything that broke apart knocked over smashed to bits carried away enrapturedthe secrets of the torture chambers the very invention of hellfrom now on everything was discovered surmised put into practice everything now was available for the magicians use everything in future served for the victory of his ideal the ascetic ideal my empire is not of this worldhe says afterwards as he said before does he really have the right to continue speaking in this way goethe asserted that there were only thirtysix tragic situations from that we can surmise if we did not know it anyway that goethe was no ascetic priest heknows more so far as this whole sort of priestly medication is concerned the guilty sort any word of criticism is too much who would really wish to defend the truth of the claim that an excess of feeling of the sort the ascetic priest habitually prescribes for his sick people under the holiest of names as is obvious while convinced of the sanctity of his purpose has truly been of use to some invalid at least we should come to an understanding of that phrase been of use if with those words people wish to assert that such a system of treatment has improved human beings then i wont contradict them i would only add what improved indicates to mesomething like tamed weakened disheartened refined mollycoddled hence almost equivalent to damaged but the main thing to consider about sick upset and depressed people is that such a system even conceding that it makes them better always makes sick people sicker you only have to ask psychiatrists what a methodical application of the torments of repentance remorse and convulsions of redemption always brings with it we should also consult history wherever the ascetic priest has put in place these ways of dealing with the sick illness has always spread far and wide at terrific speed and what has its success always involved a shattered nervous system in the person who was already illand that occurs on the largest and smallest scale among individuals and among masses of people as a consequence of a training in repentance and redemption we witness huge epidemics of epilepsy the greatest known to history as in the st vitus and st johns dances in the middle ages we find its repercussions in other forms of fearful paralysis and enduring depression with which under certain circumstances the temperament of an entire people or city geneva basel is changed into its opposite once and for all with these belong also the witch crazes something related to sleep walking eight major epidemics of this broke out between and among its consequences we also find that deathseeking mass hysteria whose horrific cry eviva la morte long live death was heard far across all of europe interrupted by idiosyncratic outburstssometimes of lust sometimes of destructive frenzies just as the same alternation of emotional affect with the same intermissions and reversals can also be observed nowadays in every case where the ascetic doctrine of sin once again enjoys a great success religious neurosis appears as a form of an evil naturethats indisputable what is it quaeritur thats what we need to ask generally speaking the ascetic ideal and its cult of moral sublimity this supremely clever unthinking and most dangerous systematization of all the ways to promote an excess of emotion under the protection of holy purposes has etched itself into the entire history of human beings in a dreadful and unforgettable mannerand alas not only into their history apart from this ideal theres scarcely anything else i know which had such a destructive effect on the health and racial power of europeans without exaggerating we can call it the true disaster in the history of the health of european people at most the specifically german influence might be comparable i refer to the alcohol poisoning of europe which up to now has marched in step with the political and racial superiority of the germans wherever they have infused their blood they have also infused their vices the third in line would be syphilismagno sed proxima intervallo next in line but after a large gap wherever he achieved mastery the ascetic priest has ruined spiritual health as a result he has also ruined taste in artibus et litteris in arts and letters he is still ruining that as a resulti hope you will concede me this as a result at least i have no desire to demonstrate it a single indication it concerns the fundamental text of christian literature its essential model its book in itself in the middle of the graecoroman magnificence which was also a magnificent time for books faced with a ancient world of writing which had not yet declined and fallen apart an age in which people could still read some books for which one would now exchange half of all literature the simplicity and vanity of christian agitatorswe call them the church fathersdared to proclaim we also have our classical literature we dont need the greeks with that they pointed with pride to books of legends letters of the apostles and little apologetic treatises in somewhat the same way as nowadays the english salvation army with its related literature fights a war against shakespeare and other pagans i dont like the new testamentyou will already have guessed as much it almost disturbs me that i stand so alone in my taste with respect to this most highly regarded and overvalued written work the taste of two thousand years is against me how can i help that here i stand i cant do otherwise i have the courage of my own bad taste the old testamentnow thats something quite different all honour to the old testament in that i find great men a heroic landscape and something of the rarest of all elements on earth the incomparable navet of the strong heart even morei find a people in the new testament by contrast i find nothing but small sectarian households nothing but spiritual rococo nothing but ornament twisty little corners oddities nothing but conventional air not to mention an occasional breeze of bucolic sweet sentimentality which belongs to the age and the roman provincesomething not so much jewish as hellenic humility and pomposity standing shoulder to shoulder a chatting about feelings which are almost stupefying vehement feelings but no passion with awkward gestures here it seems theres a lack of a good upbringing how can people make such a fuss about their small vices the way these devout little men do no oneand certainly not godcould care less about it finally they even want to possess the crown of eternal life all these small people from the provinces but what for what for its impossible to push presumption any further an immortal peterwho could endure him they have an ambition that makes one laugh they spell out their most personal thingstheir stupidity melancholy and their indolent worriesas if the essence of all things had a duty to worry about such things they never get tired of wrapping up god himself in the smallest misery they find themselves in and the most appalling taste of this constant familiarity with god this jewishand not merely jewishexcessive importuning god with mouth and paw there were small despised pagan people in east asia from whom these first christians could have learned something important some tact in their reverence as christian missionaries reveal such people were not generally allowed to utter the name of their god this seems to me sufficiently delicate but it was certainly too delicate for the first christians and not just for them to sense the contrast we should remember something about luther the most eloquent and most presumptuous peasant germany ever had and the tone luther adopted as the one he most preferred in his conversations with god luthers resistance to the interceding saints of the church especially to the devils sow the pope was undoubtedly in the last analysis the resistance of a lout irritated by the good etiquette of the church that etiquette of reverence of the priestly taste which lets only the more consecrated and the more discreet into the holy of holies and shuts the door against the louts who in this particular place are not to be heard but luther the peasant simply wanted something differentthis situation was not german enough for him above all he wanted to speak directly to speak for himself to speak openly with his god so he did it you can conjecture easily enough that there has never been a place anywhere in which the ascetic ideal has been a school of good taste even less of good manners in the best cases it was a school for priestly manners that comes about because it carries something in its own body which is the deadly enemy of all good mannersit lacks moderation it resists moderation it is itself a non plus ultra an ultimate extreme the ascetic ideal has not only ruined health and taste its has also ruined a third fourth fifth and sixth something as well ill be careful not to mention everything when would i come to the end im not going to reveal what this ideal has brought about i would much rather confine myself to what it means what it allows us to surmise what lies hidden behind under and in it what it provisionally and indistinctly expresses overloaded as it is with question marks and misunderstandings and only with this purpose in mind i cannot spare my readers a glimpse into the monstrosity of its effects its disastrous consequences in order to prepare them for the ultimate and most terrifying aspects which the question of the meaning of this ideal has for me what precisely does the power of this ideal mean the monstrous nature of this power why was it given room to grow to such an extent why was there not a more effective resistance the ascetic ideal is the expression of a will where is the opposing will in which an opposing ideal finds its expression the ascetic ideal has a goala goal which is so universal that all other interests in human existence measured against it seem small and narrow it interprets times people and humanity unsparingly with this goal in mind it permits no other interpretation no other goal counts it rejects denies affirms and confirms only through its own interpretative meaning and has there ever been an interpretative system more thoroughly thought through it doesnt submit to any power by contrast it believes in its privileged position in relation to all other powers in its absolutely higher ranking with respect to all other powers it believes that there is no power on earth which does not have to derive its meaning first from it a right to exist a value as a tool in its own work as a way and a means to its own goals to a single goal where is the counterpart to this closed system of will goal and interpretation why is this counterpart missing where is the other single goal but people tell me that counterpart isnt missing claiming that it has not only fought a long and successful war with the ascetic ideal but has also already mastered that ideal on all major points that all our modern scientific knowledge is a testament to thismodern science which as a true philosophy of reality evidently believes only in itself possesses courage and will in itself and has got along up to this point well enough without god a world beyond and virtues which deny however im not impressed with such a fuss and agitprop these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians one can hear well enough that their notes do not sound out of the depths the abyss of scientific conscience does not speak through themfor today scientific knowledge is an abyss the phrase scientific knowledge in such trumpeting mouths is mere fornication an abuse an indecency the truth is precisely the opposite of what is claimed here scientific knowledge nowadays has simply no faith in itself to say nothing of an overarching ideal and where it consists of passion love ardour suffering that doesnt make it the opposite of the ascetic ideal but much rather its newest and most preeminent form does that sound strange to you there are indeed a sufficient number of good and modest working people among scholars nowadays people happy in their little corners for this reason because their work satisfies them from time to time with some presumption they make noises demanding that people today should in general be happy particularly with scientific knowledge there are so many useful things to do i dont deny that the last thing i want to do is to ruin the pleasure these honest labourers take in their handiwork for im happy about their work but the fact that people are working rigorously in science these days and that there are satisfied workers is simply no proof that science today as a totality has a goal a will an ideal a passion in a great faith as ive said the opposite is the case where science is not the most recently appearing form of the ascetic idealand then its a matter of cases too rare noble and exceptional to counter the general judgmentscience today is a hiding place for all kinds of unhappiness disbelief gnawing worms despectio sui selfcontempt bad conscience it is the anxiety of the absence of ideals suffering from the lack of a great love the dissatisfaction with a condition of involuntary modest content oh what nowadays does science not conceal how much at least is it designed to conceal the efficiency of our best scholars their mindless diligence their heads smoking day and night the very mastery of their handiworkhow often has all this derived its meaning from the fact that they dont permit some things to become visible to them any more science as a means of putting themselves to sleep are you acquainted with that now and then people wound scholars to the boneeveryone who associates with them experiences thiswith a harmless word we anger our scholarly friends just when we intend to honour them we drive them wild merely because we were too coarse to figure out the people we are really dealing with suffering people who dont wish to admit to themselves what they are narcotised and mindless people who fear only one thingcoming to consciousness now lets consider on the other hand those rare cases i mentioned the last idealists remaining today among the philosophers and scholars perhaps in them we have the opponents of the ascetic ideal were looking for the opposing idealists in fact thats what they think they are these unbelievers for thats what they are collectively that seems to be their last item of belief that they are opponents of this ideal for they are so serious about this stance their words and gestures are so passionate on this very point but is it therefore necessarily the case that what they believe is true we knowledgeable people are positively suspicious of all forms of belief our suspicion has gradually cultivated the habit in us of concluding the reverse of what people previously concluded that is wherever the strength of a faith steps decisively into the foreground we infer a certain weakness in its ability to demonstrate its truth even the improbability of what it believes we do not deny that the belief makes blessed but for that very reason we deny that the belief proves anything a strong belief which confers blessedness creates doubts about what it has faith in it does not ground truth it grounds a certain probabilitydelusion how do things stand in this casethese people who say no today these outsiders these people who are determined on one point their demand for intellectual probity these hard strong abstemious heroic spirits who constitute the honour of our age all these pale atheists antichristians immoralists nihilists these sceptics ephectics spiritually hectic collectively they are all hectic in some sense or other the last idealists of knowledge the only ones in whom intellectual conscience lives and takes on human form nowadaysthey really do believe that they are as free as possible from the ascetic ideal these free very free spirits and yet i am revealing to them what they cannot see for themselves for they are standing too close to themselves this ascetic ideal is also their very own ideal they themselves represent it today perhaps they are the only ones who do they themselves are its most spiritual offspring the furthest advanced of its troops and its crowd of scouts fighting at the very front its most awkward most delicate most incomprehensibly seductive form if i am any kind of solver of puzzles then i want to be that with this statement they are not free spiritsnot by any stretchfor they still believe in the truth when the christian crusaders in the orient came across that unconquered order of assassins that freespirited order par excellence whose lowest ranks lived a life of obedience of the sort no order of monks attained then they received by some means or other a hint about that symbol and motto which only the highest ranks kept as their secret nothing is true everything is permitted well now that was spiritual freedom with that the very belief in truth was cancelled has a european a christian free spirit ever wandered by mistake into this proposition and its labyrinthine consequences has he come to know the minotaur of this cavern from his own experience i doubt it more that that i know differently nothing is more immediately foreign to people set on one thing these socalled free spirits than freedom and emancipation in this sense in these matters they are more firmly bound because they believe in the truth as no one else does firmly and unconditionally perhaps i understand all this from too close a distance that admirable philosophical abstinence which such a belief requires that intellectual stoicism which ultimately does not permit one to affirm just as strongly as it forbids one to deny that desire to come to a standstill before the facts the factum brutum brute fact that fatalism of the petits faits small facts what i call ce petit faitalisme this small factism that quality with which french science nowadays seeks a sort of moral precedence over german science the attainment of a state where one in general abandons interpretation violating emending abbreviating letting go filling in the cracks composing forging and the other actions which belong to the nature of all interpretation generally speaking this attitude expresses just as much virtuous asceticism as any denial of sensuality basically it is only one mode of this denial however what compels a person to this unconditional will for truth is the faith in the ascetic ideal itself even though it may be for him an unconscious imperative we should not deceive ourselves on this pointit is a belief in a metaphysical value the value of truth in itself something guaranteed and affirmed only in that ideal it stands or falls with that ideal strictly speaking there is no scientific knowledge at all which stands without presuppositions the idea of such a science is unimaginable paralogical a philosophy a belief must always be there first so that with it scientific knowledge can have a direction a sense a border a method a justification an existence whoever thinks the reverse whoever for example is preparing to place philosophy on a strictly scientific foundation first must place not just philosophy but also truth itself on its headthe worst injury to decency one could possibly give to two such venerable women indeed there is no doubt about this matterand here im letting my book the gay science have a word see its fifth book p the truthful person in that daring and ultimate sense which the belief in scientific knowledge presupposes in him affirms a world different from the world of life of nature and of history and to the extent that he affirms this other world must he not in the process deny its opposite this world our world our faith in scientific knowledge always rests on something which is still a metaphysical beliefeven we knowledgeable people of today we godless and antimetaphysical peoplewe still take our fire from that blaze kindled by a thousand years of old belief that faith in christianity which was also platos belief that god is the truth that the truth is divine but how can we do that if this very claim is constantly getting more and more difficult to believe if nothing reveals itself as divine any more unless its error blindness and lies if god himself manifests himself as our oldest lie at this point its necessary to pause and reflect for a while scientific knowledge itself from now on requires some justification by that i dont mean to claim that there is such a justification for it people should examine the oldest and the most recent philosophers on this question they all lack an awareness of the problem of the extent to which the will to truth itself first needs some justificationhere is a hole in every philosophy how does that come about its because the ascetic ideal up to this point has been master of all philosophies because truth has been established as being as god as the highest authority itself because truth was not allowed to be problematic do you understand this allowed the moment where the belief in the god of the ascetic ideal is denied there is a new problem the problem of the value of truththe will to truth requires a critique lets identify our own work with that requirementto place in question as an experiment the value of truth anyone who thinks this has been stated too briefly is urged to read over that section of the gay science pp ff which carries the title the extent to which we also are still devoutor better still the entire fifth book of that work as well as the preface to the dawn no people should not come at me with scientific knowledge when i am looking for the natural antagonist of the ascetic ideal when i ask where is the opposing will in which an opposing ideal expresses itself for that purpose scientific knowledge does not stand sufficiently on its own for that it first requires an ideal value the power to make value in whose service it could have faith in itself but scientific knowledge is never in itself something which creates values its relationship to the ascetic ideal is not inherently antagonistic at all its even more that case that it represents the constantly forward driving force in the inner development of that ideal its resistance and struggle when we inspect more closely are not concerned in any way with the ideal itself but only with its external trappings its clothing its masquerade its temporary hardening and petrifaction into dogma scientific knowledge makes the life of this ideal free again since it denies what is exoteric in it these two things scientific knowledge and the ascetic idealthey really stand on a single foundationive just clarified the point namely that they both stand on the same overvaluing of the truth or more correctly on the same faith in the inestimable value of the truth which for them is beyond criticism in that very claim they are necessarily allies so that if someone is going to fight against them he can only fight them together and place them both in question an appraisal of the value of the ascetic ideal unavoidably also involves an appraisal of the value of scientific knowledge and for that people should take the time to keep their eyes open and their ears alert as for artlet me offer a preliminary remark for ill be coming back to it at some point or other at greater length the very art in which the lie sanctifies itself and the will to deceive has good conscience is much more fundamentally opposed to the ascetic ideal than is science thats what platos instinct experiencedthe greatest enemy of art which europe has produced up to this point plato versus homer thats the entire the real antagonismon one side the beyond of the best will the great slanderer of life on the other side lifes unintentional worshipper the golden nature a artistic bondage in the service of the ascetic ideal is thus essentially the worst corruption of the artist there can be unfortunately its also one of the most common for nothing is more corruptible than an artist physiologically considered scientific knowledge rests on the same foundation as the ascetic ideal a certain impoverishment of life is the precondition for bothemotional affects become cool the tempo slows down dialectic replaces instinct seriousness stamped on faces and gestures seriousness this unmistakable sign of a more laborious metabolism of a life of struggle and hard work just look at those periods in a population when the scholars step up into the foreground they are times of exhaustion often of evening of decline an overflowing force and certainty about life and the future have gone a preponderance of mandarins never indicates anything goodno more than does the arrival of democracy the peaceful tribunal instead of war equal rights for women the religion of pity and all the other things symptomatic of a degenerating life science grasped as a problem what does science meanon this point see the preface to the birth of tragedy no this modern sciencekeep your eyes open at this pointis for the time being the best ally of the ascetic ideal and precisely for this reason it is the most unconscious most involuntary most secret and most subterranean ally they have up to now been playing the same game the poor in spirit and the scientific opponents of this ideal we should be careful incidentally not to think that these opponents are the opposite of that ideal something like the rich in spiritthey are not i call them the hectic in spirit the famous victories of the latterand they have undoubtedly been victoriesbut over what they in no way overcame the ascetic ideal with those victories the ideal rather became stronger that is harder to understand more spiritual more dangerous as scientific knowledge ruthlessly and continually kept breaking off and demolishing a wall an external structure which the ideal had built onto itself and coarsened its appearance do people really think that something like the downfall of theological astronomy indicates the downfall of that ideal because of that have human beings perhaps become less dependent on redemption in a world beyond as a solution for the puzzle of their existence given that existence since that time looks in the visible order of things even more arbitrary indolent and dispensable isnt it the case that since copernicus the selfdiminution of human beings and their will to selfdiminution have made inexorable progress alas the faith in their dignity their uniqueness their irreplaceable position in the chain of being has gone the human being has become an animal not a metaphorical animal but absolutely and unconditionallythe one who in his earlier faith was almost god child of god godman gottmensch since copernicus human beings seem to have reached an inclined plane theyre now rolling at an accelerating rate past the midpoint but where to into nothingness into the penetrating sense of their own nothingness well then wouldnt this be precisely the way into the old ideal all scientific knowledge and not just astronomy whose humbling and destructive effects kant understood remarkably well it destroys my importance all scientific knowledge natural as well as unnatural the name i give to the selfcriticism of knowledge is nowadays keen to talk human beings out of the respect they used to have for themselves as if that was nothing more than a bizarre arrogance about themselves in this matter we could even say scientific knowledge has its own pride its characteristically acrid form of stoical ataraxia indifference this laboriously attained selfcontempt for human beings as its ultimate most serious demand for respect for the right to hold itself erect on its own and in fact thats justified for the one who despises is always still one more person who has not forgotten respect does that really work against the ascetic ideal do people really think in all seriousness as theologians imagined for quite a while that somehow kants victory over dogmatic theological concepts god soul freedom immortality succeeded in breaking up that ideal in asking that question its not our concern at the moment whether kant himself had anything like that in mind what is certain is that all sorts of transcendentalists since kant have once more won the game theyve become emancipated from the theologians what a stroke of luck kant showed them a secret path by which they could now on their own initiative and with the most sincere scientific decency follow their hearts desires and similarly who could now hold anything against the agnostics if they as admirers of what is inherently unknown and secret worship the question mark itself as their god xaver doudan once spoke of the ravages brought on by lhabitude dadmirer linintelligible au lieu de rester tout simplement dans linconnu the habit of admiring the unintelligible instead of simply staying in the unknown he claimed that the ancients had not done this if everything human beings know does not satisfy their wishes and beyond that contradicts them and makes human beings shudder what a divine excuse to be allowed to seek the blame for this not in wishes but in knowledge there is no knowledge consequently there is a godwhat a new elegantia syllogismi syllogistic excellence what a triumph of the ascetic ideal or does modern historical writing collectively perhaps display an attitude more confident about life more confident about ideals its noblest claim nowadays asserts that it is a mirror it eschews all teleology it doesnt want to prove anything any more it spurns playing the role of judge and derives its good taste from that it affirms as little as it denies it establishes the facts it describes all this is ascetic to a high degree however it is also to an even higher degree nihilistic we must not deceive ourselves on this point we see a sad hard but determined gazean eye which looks into the distance the way a solitary traveller at the north pole gazes out perhaps so as not to look inside or behind him here is snow here life is quite silent the final crows that make noise here are called what for in vain and nada nothinghere nothing thrives and grows any moreat most petersburg metapolitics and tolstoian pity but so far as that other style of historian is concerned maybe an even more modern style which is more comfortable and sensual and makes eyes at life as well as at the ascetic idealthis style uses the word artist as a glove and has taken an exclusive lease on the praise of contemplation oh what a thirst these sweet and witty types arouse in people for ascetics and winter landscapes no let these meditative people go to the devil i would much prefer to keep wandering with those historical nihilists through the gloomiest cold gray fog in fact if i had to choose i might find it better to lend a ear to a completely and essentially unhistorical or antihistorical man like that dhrung whose tones intoxicate a species of beautiful souls in germany today people who up to now have been timid and unassuming the species anarchistica the anarchists within the educated proletariat the contemplative ones are a hundred times worse i know nothing that creates so much disgust as such an objective armchair historian such a sweetsmelling man luxuriating in history half cleric half satyr with perfume by renan who reveals at once in the high falsetto of his approval what he lacks where is he deficient where in his case the fates have wielded their dreadful shears with alas so much surgical precision that affronts my taste as well as my patience confronted with such sights let those be patient who have nothing to lose by them such a picture infuriates me such lookers on make me angry with the performance even more than the performance itself history itself you understand seeing that i fall unexpectedly into an anacreontic mood this nature which gave the bull his horns the lion his chasm odonton chasm of teeth why did nature give me a foot to kick with by holy anacreon not merely to run off but also to kick apart these decrepit armchairs this cowardly contemplation this lascivious acting like eunuchs in history the flirting with ascetic ideals the hypocritical justice of impotence i grant all honour to the ascetic ideal insofar as it is honest so long as it believes in itself and does not play games with us but i cant stand all these coquettish insects with their insatiable ambition to smell the infinite until finally the infinite stinks of bugs i cant stand these white sepulchres who treat life as a spectacle i cant stand the tired and useless people who wrap themselves up in wisdom and gaze out objectively i cant stand the agitators who dress themselves up as heroes and who wear a magic hat of ideals on heads stuffed with straw i cant stand the ambitious artists who like to present themselves as ascetics and priests but who are basically tragic clowns and i cant stand these most recent speculators in idealism the antisemites who nowadays roll their eyes in a christianaryanbourgeois way and seek to inflame all the hornedanimal elements among the people by abusing the cheapest forms of agitation in a way that exhausts my patience the fact that every kind of spiritual fraud succeeds in presentday germany is the result of the absolutely undeniable and tangible desolation of the german spirit whose cause i look for in an excessively strict diet limited to newspapers politics beer and wagnerian music together with the preconditions for such a diet first a restricting nationalism and vanity that strong but narrow principle germany germany over everything as well as the paralysis agitans trembling palsy of modern ideas today europe is rich and resourceful above all in ways of arousing people nothing seems to be more important to possess than stimulants and firewater hence the monstrous falsification of ideals the most powerful firewater of the spirit hence also the unfavourable stinking lying pseudoalcoholic air everywhere id like to know how many shiploads of counterfeit idealism of heroic costumes and rattles full of nonsensical big words how many tons of sugary spiritual sympathy its business name la religion de la souffrance the religion of suffering how many stilts of noble indignation to assist the spiritually flatfooted and how many of those play acting the christian moral ideal would have to be exported from europe so that its air might smell cleaner once again obviously as far as this overproduction is concerned a new commercial opportunity has opened up obviously there is new business to be made with small gods of ideals and their accompanying idealists people should not fail to respond to this hint who has the courage for it we have it in our hands to idealize the entire earth but why am i talking about courage only one thing is necessary here just the hand an uninhibited a very uninhibited hand enough enough lets leave these curiosities and complexities of the most modern spirit which inspire as much laughter as irritation our problem can do without them the problem of the meaning of the ascetic ideal what has that to do with yesterday and today i am going to approach these issues more fundamentally and more forcefully in another connection under the title the history of european nihilism i refer to a work which i am preparing the will to power an attempt to reevaluate all values what i have been dealing with here is only the followingto establish that the ascetic ideal has for the time being even in the spiritual sphere only one kind of true enemy who can inflict harm and that enemy is those who playact this idealfor they awaken distrust everywhere else where the spirit nowadays is strong powerful and working without counterfeiting it generally dispenses with the idealthe popular expression for this abstinence is atheism except for its will to truth but this will this remnant of the ideal is if people wish to believe me that very ideal in its strongest most spiritual formulation thoroughly esoteric stripped of all its outer structures and thus nothing except a remnant its kernel consequently absolutely unconditional atheism and thats the only air we breathe we more spiritual men of this age does not stand opposed to this ideal as it appears to do it is much rather only one of its last stages of development one of its concluding forms and innerly logical outcomes it demands reverence this catastrophe of twothousand years of breeding for the truth which concludes by forbidding itself the lie of a faith in god the same process of development in india which was fully independent of europe and therefore proof of somethingthis same ideal forced things to a similar conclusion the decisive point was reached five centuries before the european calendar with buddha or more precisely with the sankhya philosophy for this was popularized by buddha and made into a religion putting the question as forcefully as possible what really triumphed over the christian god the answer stands in my gay science p christian morality itself the increasingly strict understanding of the idea of truthfulness the subtlety of the father confessor of the christian conscience transposed and sublimated into scientific conscience into intellectual cleanliness at any price to look at nature as if it were a proof of the goodness and care of a god to interpret history in such a way as to honour divine reason as a constant testament to a moral world order and moral intentions to interpret ones own experiences as devout men have interpreted them for long enough as if everything was divine providence everything was a sign everything was thought out and sent for the salvation of the soul out of lovenow thats over and done with that has conscience against it among more sensitive consciences that counts as something indecent dishonest as lying feminism weakness cowardice with this rigour if with anything we are good europeans and heirs to europes longest and bravest overcoming of the self all great things destroy themselves by an act of selfcancellation thats what the law of life wills that law of the necessary selfovercoming in the essence of lifeeventually the call always goes out to the lawmaker himself patere legem quam ipse tulisti submit to the law which you yourself have established thats the way christianity was destroyed as dogma by its own morality thats the way christendom as morality must now be destroyed we stand on the threshold of this event after christian truthfulness has come to a series of conclusions it will draw its strongest conclusion its conclusion against itself however this will occur when it poses the question what is the meaning of all will to truth here i move back again to my problem to our problem my unknown friends for i still dont know anything about friends what sense would our whole being have if not for the fact that in us that will to truth became aware of itself as a problem because this will to truth from now on is growing conscious of itself morality undoubtedly dies that great spectacle in one hundred acts which remains reserved for the next two centuries in europe that most fearful most questionable and perhaps also most hopeful of all spectacles if we leave aside the ascetic ideal then man the animal man has had no meaning up to this point his existence on earth has had no purpose why man at all was a question without an answer the will for man and earth was missing behind every great human destiny echoes as refrain an even greater in vain thats just what the ascetic ideal means that something is missing that a huge hole surrounds man he did not know how to justify himself to himself to explain to affirm he suffered from the problem of his being he also suffered in other ways he was for the most part a sick animal the suffering itself was not his problem but rather the fact that he lacked an answer to the question he screamed out why this suffering man the bravest animal the one most accustomed to suffering does not deny suffering in itself he desires it he seeks it out in person provided that people show him a meaning for it the purpose of suffering the curse that earlier spread itself over men was not suffering but the senselessness of sufferingand the ascetic ideal offered him a meaning the ascetic ideal was the only reason offered up to that point any meaning is better than no meaning at all however you look at it the ascetic ideal has so far been a faute de mieux for lack of something better par excellence in it suffering was interpreted the huge hole appeared filled in the door shut against all suicidal nihilism the interpretation undoubtedly brought new suffering with itmore profound more inner more poisonous and more lifegnawing suffering it brought all suffering under the perspective of guilt but nevertheless with it man was saved he had a meaning from that point on he was no longer a leaf in the wind a toy ball of nonsense of without sense he could now will somethingat first it didnt matter where why or how he willed the will itself was saved we simply cannot conceal from ourselves whats really expressed by that total will which received its direction from the ascetic ideal this hate against what is human and even more against animality even more against material thingsthis abhorrence of the senses even of reason this fear of happiness and beauty this longing for the beyond away from all appearance change becoming death desire even longing itselfall this means lets have the courage to understand this a will to nothingness an aversion to life a revolt against the most fundamental preconditions of lifebut it is and remains a will and to repeat at the conclusion what i said at the start man will sooner will nothingness than not will translated by ian johnston of malaspina universitycollege nanaimo bc
