Preface to the First German Edition Marx  
The work the first volume of which I now submit to the public forms the continuation of my Zur 
Kritik  der  Politischen  Oekonomie  A  Contribution  to  the  Criticism  of  Political  Economy 
published in  The long pause between the first part and the continuation is due to an illness 
of many years duration that again and again interrupted my work  
The substance of that earlier work is summarised in the first three chapters of this volume This is 
done  not  merely  for  the  sake  of  connexion  and  completeness  The  presentation  of  the  subject 
matter is improved As far as circumstances in any way permit many points only hinted at in the 
earlier book are here worked out more fully whilst conversely points worked out fully there are 
only  touched  upon  in this volume  The  sections  on  the  history  of  the theories of  value  and  of 
money are now of course left out altogether The reader of the earlier work will find however 
in  the  notes  to  the  first  chapter  additional  sources  of  reference  relative  to  the  history  of  those 
theories  
Every beginning is difficult holds in all sciences To understand the first chapter especially the 
section that contains the analysis of commodities will therefore present the greatest difficulty 
That which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of 
value I have as much as it was possible popularised The valueform whose fully developed 
shape is the moneyform is very elementary and simple Nevertheless the human mind has for 
more than  years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it all whilst on the other hand to the 
successful  analysis  of  much  more  composite  and  complex  forms  there  has  been  at  least  an 
approximation Why Because the body as an organic whole is more easy of study than are the 
cells  of  that  body  In  the  analysis  of  economic  forms  moreover  neither  microscopes  nor 
chemical reagents are of use The force of abstraction must replace both But in bourgeois society 
the commodityform of the product of labour  or valueform of the commodity  is the economic 
cellform To the superficial observer the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae It 
does in fact deal with minutiae but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic 
anatomy  
With the exception of the section on valueform therefore this volume cannot stand accused on 
the score of difficulty I presuppose of course a reader who is willing to learn something new 
and therefore to think for himself  
The physicist either observes physical phenomena where they occur in their most typical form 
and  most  free  from  disturbing  influence  or  wherever  possible  he  makes  experiments  under 
conditions that assure the occurrence of the phenomenon in its normality In this work I have to 
examine  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  and  the  conditions  of  production  and  exchange 
corresponding to that mode Up to the present time their classic ground is England That is the 
reason why England is used as the chief illustration in the development of my theoretical ideas If 
however the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and 
agricultural labourers or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in Germany 
things are not nearly so bad I must plainly tell him De te fabula narratur It is of you that the 
story is told  Horace  
Intrinsically  it  is  not  a  question  of  the  higher  or  lower  degree  of  development  of  the  social 
antagonisms that result from the natural laws of capitalist production It is a question of these 
laws themselves of these tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results The 

 

 

Preface to the First German Edition Marx  
 
country that is more developed industrially only shows to the less developed the image of its 
own future  
But  apart  from  this  Where  capitalist  production  is  fully  naturalised  among  the  Germans  for 
instance in the factories proper the condition of things is much worse than in England because 
the  counterpoise  of  the  Factory  Acts  is  wanting  In  all  other  spheres  we  like  all  the  rest  of 
Continental Western Europe suffer not only from the development of capitalist production but 
also from the incompleteness of that development Alongside the modern evils a whole series of 
inherited evils oppress us arising from the passive survival of antiquated modes of production 
with  their  inevitable  train  of  social  and  political  anachronisms  We  suffer  not  only  from  the 
living but from the dead Le mort saisit le vif The dead holds the living in his grasp  formula 
of French common law  
The social statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe are in comparison 
with those of England wretchedly compiled But they raise the veil just enough to let us catch a 
glimpse of the Medusa head behind it We should be appalled at the state of things at home if as 
in England our governments and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into 
economic conditions if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at 
the truth if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent as free from partisanship 
and  respect  of  persons  as  are  the  English  factoryinspectors  her  medical  reporters  on  public 
health her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation of women and children into housing 
and food Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a makebelieve that there are 
no monsters  
Let us not deceive ourselves on this As in the th century the American war of independence 
sounded the tocsin for the European middle class so that in the th century the American Civil 
War sounded it for the European working class In England the process of social disintegration is 
palpable When it has reached a certain point it must react on the Continent There it will take a 
form more brutal or more humane according to the degree of development of the working class 
itself  Apart  from  higher  motives  therefore  their  own  most  important  interests  dictate  to  the 
classes that are for the nonce the ruling ones the removal of all legally removable hindrances to 
the free development of the working class For this reason as well as others I have given so large 
a space in this volume to the history the details and the results of English factory legislation 
One nation can and should learn from others And even when a society has got upon the right 
track for the discovery of the natural laws of its movement  and it is the ultimate aim of this 
work to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society  it can neither clear by bold 
leaps  nor  remove  by  legal  enactments  the  obstacles  offered  by  the  successive  phases  of  its 
normal development But it can shorten and lessen the birthpangs  
To prevent possible misunderstanding a word I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense 
couleur de rose ie seen through rosetinted glasses But here individuals are dealt with only in 
so far as they are the personifications of economic categories embodiments of particular class
relations and classinterests My standpoint from which the evolution of the economic formation 
of society is viewed as a process of natural history can less than any other make the individual 
responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains however much he may subjectively 
raise himself above them  
In the domain of Political Economy free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as 
in all other domains The peculiar nature of the materials it deals with summons as foes into the 
field of battle the most violent mean and malignant passions of the human breast the Furies of 
private interest The English Established Church eg will more readily pardon an attack on  of 
its  articles than on  of its income Nowadays atheism is culpa levis a relatively slight 
 

 

Preface to the First German Edition Marx  
 
sin cf mortal sin as compared with criticism of existing property relations Nevertheless there 
is an unmistakable advance I refer eg to the Blue book published within the last few weeks 
Correspondence  with  Her  Majestys  Missions  Abroad  regarding  Industrial  Questions  and 
Trades Unions The representatives of the English Crown in foreign countries there declare in 
so many words that in Germany in France to be brief in all the civilised states of the European 
Continent radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour is as evident and 
inevitable as in England At the same time on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean Mr Wade 
vicepresident of the United States declared in public meetings that after the abolition of slavery 
a radical change of the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the 
day These are signs of the times not to be hidden by purple mantles or black cassocks They do 
not  signify  that  tomorrow  a  miracle  will  happen  They  show  that  within  the  ruling  classes 
themselves a foreboding is dawning that the present society is no solid crystal but an organism 
capable of change and is constantly changing  
The second volume of this book will treat of the process of the circulation of capital Book II 
and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course of its development Book III the third 
and last volume Book IV the history of the theory  
Every  opinion  based  on  scientific  criticism  I  welcome  As  to  prejudices  of  socalled  public 
opinion  to  which  I  have  never  made  concessions  now  as  aforetime  the  maxim  of  the  great 
Florentine is mine

  This  is  the  more  necessary  as  even  the  section  of  Ferdinand  Lassalles  work  against  Schulze
Delitzsch in which he professes to give the intellectual quintessence of my explanations on these 
subjects contains important mistakes If  Ferdinand  Lassalle has borrowed almost literally from  my 
writings and without any acknowledgement all the general theoretical propositions in his economic 
works eg those on the historical character of capital on the connexion between the conditions of 
production and the mode of production c c even to the terminology created by me this may 
perhaps be due to purposes of propaganda I am here of course not speaking of his detailed working 
out and application of these propositions with which I have nothing to do 

 

 

Preface to the French Edition Marx  

To the citizen Maurice Lachtre 
Dear Citizen 
I applaud your idea of publishing the translation of Das Kapital as a serial In this form the 
book  will  be  more  accessible  to  the  working  class  a  consideration  which  to  me  outweighs 
everything else 
That  is the  good  side  of  your  suggestion  but  here  is  the  reverse  of  the  medal  the  method  of 
analysis  which  I  have  employed  and  which  had  not  previously  been  applied  to  economic 
subjects  makes  the  reading  of  the  first  chapters  rather  arduous  and it is to  be  feared that  the 
French public always impatient to come to a conclusion eager to know the connexion between 
general  principles  and  the  immediate  questions  that  have  aroused  their  passions  may  be 
disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once 
That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome unless it be by forewarning and forearming 
those readers who zealously seek the truth There is no royal road to science and only those who 
do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits

dear citizen

Afterword to the Second German Edition  
I must start by informing the readers of the first edition about the alterations made in the second 
edition  One  is  struck  at  once  by  the  clearer  arrangement  of  the  book  Additional  notes  are 
everywhere marked as notes to the second edition The following are the most important points 
with regard to the text itself  
In Chapter I Section  the derivation of value from an analysis of the equations by which every 
exchangevalue is expressed has been carried out with greater scientific strictness likewise the 
connexion between the substance of value and the determination of the magnitude of value by 
socially necessary labourtime which was only alluded to in the first edition is now expressly 
emphasised Chapter I Section  the Form of Value has been completely revised a task which 
was made necessary by the double exposition in the first edition if nothing else  Let me remark 
in passing that that double exposition had been occasioned by my friend Dr L Kugelmann in 
Hanover  I  was  visiting  him  in  the  spring  of    when  the  first  proofsheets  arrived  from 
Hamburg  and  he  convinced  me  that  most  readers  needed  a  supplementary  more  didactic 
explanation  of  the  form  of  value    The  last  section  of  the  first  chapter  The  Fetishism  of 
Commodities etc has largely been altered Chapter III Section I The Measure of Value has 
been carefully revised because in the first edition this section had been treated negligently the 
reader  having  been  referred  to  the  explanation  already  given  in  Zur  Kritik  der  Politischen 
Oekonomie Berlin  Chapter VII particularly Part  Eng ed Chapter IX Section  has 
been rewritten to a great extent  
It would be a waste of time to go into all the partial textual changes which were often purely 
stylistic  They  occur  throughout  the  book  Nevertheless  I  find  now  on  revising  the  French 
translation appearing in Paris that several parts of the German original stand in need of rather 
thorough remoulding other parts require rather heavy stylistic editing and still others painstaking 
elimination of occasional slips But there was no time for that For I had been informed only in 
the autumn of  when in the midst of other urgent work that the book was sold out and that 
the printing of the second edition was to begin in January of   
The appreciation which Das Kapital rapidly gained in wide circles of the German working class 
is the best reward of my labours Herr Mayer a Vienna manufacturer who in economic matters 
represents the bourgeois point of view in a pamphlet published during the FrancoGerman War 
aptly  expounded  the  idea  that  the  great  capacity  for  theory  which  used  to  be  considered  a 
hereditary  German  possession  had  almost  completely  disappeared  amongst  the  socalled 
educated classes in Germany but that amongst its working class on the contrary that capacity 
was celebrating its revival  
To the present moment Political Economy in Germany is a foreign science Gustav von Gulich 
in his Historical description of Commerce Industry c   especially in the two first volumes 
published  in    has  examined  at  length  the  historical  circumstances  that  prevented  in 
Germany  the  development  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  and  consequently  the 
development  in  that  country  of  modern  bourgeois  society  Thus  the  soil  whence  Political 
Economy springs was wanting This science had to be imported from England and France as a 
readymade article its German professors remained schoolboys The theoretical expression of a 
foreign  reality  was  turned  in  their  hands  into  a  collection  of  dogmas  interpreted  by  them  in 
terms  of  the  petty  trading  world  around  them  and  therefore  misinterpreted  The  feeling  of 
scientific impotence a feeling not wholly to be repressed and the uneasy consciousness of having 

 

 

Afterword to the Second German Edition  
 
to touch a subject in reality foreign to them was but imperfectly concealed either under a parade 
of literary and historical erudition or by an admixture of extraneous material borrowed from the 
socalled  Kameral  sciences  a  medley  of  smatterings  through  whose  purgatory  the  hopeful 
candidate for the German bureaucracy has to pass  
Since  capitalist production has developed rapidly in Germany and at the present time it is in 
the  full  bloom  of  speculation  and  swindling  But  fate  is  still  unpropitious  to  our  professional 
economists At the time when they were able to deal with Political Economy in a straightforward 
fashion modern economic conditions did not actually exist in Germany And as soon as these 
conditions did come into existence they did so under circumstances that no longer allowed of 
their being really and impartially investigated within the bounds of the bourgeois horizon In so 
far as Political Economy remains within that horizon in so far ie as the capitalist regime is 
looked upon as the absolutely final form of social production instead of as a passing historical 
phase of its evolution Political Economy can remain a science only so long as the class struggle 
is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena  
Let us take England Its Political Economy belongs to the period in which the class struggle was 
as  yet  undeveloped  Its  last  great  representative  Ricardo  in  the  end  consciously  makes  the 
antagonism of class interests of wages and profits of profits and rent the starting point of his 
investigations  naively  taking  this  antagonism  for  a  social  law  of  Nature  But  by  this  start  the 
science of bourgeois economy had reached the limits beyond which it could not pass Already in 
the  lifetime  of  Ricardo  and  in  opposition  to  him  it  was  met  by  criticism  in  the  person  of 
Sismondi  
The succeeding period from  to  was notable in England for scientific activity in the 
domain  of  Political  Economy  It  was  the  time  as  well  of  the  vulgarising  and  extending  of 
Ricardos theory as of the contest of that theory with the old school Splendid tournaments were 
held What was done then is little known to the Continent generally because the polemic is for 
the  most  part  scattered  through  articles  in  reviews  occasional  literature  and  pamphlets  The 
unprejudiced  character  of  this  polemic    although  the  theory  of  Ricardo  already  serves  in 
exceptional  cases  as  a  weapon  of  attack  upon  bourgeois  economy    is  explained  by  the 
circumstances of the time On the one hand modern industry itself was only just emerging from 
the age of childhood as is shown by the fact that with the crisis of  it for the first time opens 
the periodic cycle of its modern life On the other hand the class struggle between capital and 
labour is forced into the background politically by the discord between the governments and the 
feudal aristocracy gathered around the Holy Alliance on the one hand and the popular masses 
led by the bourgeoisie on the other economically by the quarrel between industrial capital and 
aristocratic landed property  a quarrel that in France was concealed by the opposition between 
small and large landed property and that in England broke out openly after the Corn Laws The 
literature  of  Political  Economy  in  England  at  this  time  calls  to  mind  the  stormy  forward 
movement in France after Dr Quesnays death but only as a Saint Martins summer reminds us 
of spring With the year  came the decisive crisis  
In France and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power Thenceforth the class 
struggle practically as well as theoretically took on more and more outspoken and threatening 
forms  It  sounded  the  knell  of  scientific  bourgeois  economy  It  was  thenceforth  no  longer  a 
question whether this theorem or that was true but whether it was useful to capital or harmful 
expedient or inexpedient politically dangerous or not In place of disinterested inquirers there 
were hired prize fighters in place of genuine scientific research the bad conscience and the evil 
intent of apologetic Still even the obtrusive pamphlets with which the AntiCorn Law League 
led by the manufacturers Cobden and Bright deluged the world have a historic interest if no 

 

 

Afterword to the Second German Edition  
 
scientific one on account of their polemic against the landed aristocracy But since then the Free 
Trade legislation inaugurated by Sir Robert Peel has deprived vulgar economy of this its last 
sting 
The  Continental  revolution  of    also  had  its reaction in  England  Men  who  still  claimed 
some scientific standing and aspired to be something more than mere sophists and sycophants of 
the ruling classes tried to harmonise the Political Economy of capital with the claims no longer to 
be ignored of the proletariat Hence a shallow syncretism of which John Stuart Mill is the best 
representative It is a declaration of bankruptcy by bourgeois economy an event on which the 
great Russian scholar and critic N Tschernyschewsky has thrown the light of a master mind in 
his Outlines of Political Economy according to Mill  
In Germany therefore the capitalist mode of production came to a head after its antagonistic 
character  had  already  in  France  and  England  shown  itself  in  a  fierce  strife  of  classes  And 
meanwhile moreover the German proletariat had attained a much more clear classconsciousness 
than the German bourgeoisie Thus at the very moment when a bourgeois science of Political 
Economy seemed at last possible in Germany it had in reality again become impossible  
Under  these  circumstances  its  professors  fell  into  two  groups  The  one  set  prudent  practical 
business  folk  flocked  to  the  banner  of  Bastiat  the  most  superficial  and  therefore  the  most 
adequate representative of the apologetic of vulgar economy the other proud of the professorial 
dignity of their science followed John Stuart Mill in his attempt to reconcile irreconcilables Just 
as in the classical time of bourgeois economy so also in the time of its decline the Germans 
remained mere schoolboys imitators and followers petty retailers and hawkers in the service of 
the great foreign wholesale concern  
The  peculiar  historical  development  of  German  society  therefore  forbids  in  that  country  all 
original  work  in  bourgeois  economy  but  not  the  criticism  of  that  economy  So  far  as  such 
criticism  represents  a  class  it  can  only  represent  the  class  whose  vocation  in  history  is  the 
overthrow  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  and  the  final  abolition  of  all  classes    the 
proletariat  
The  learned  and  unlearned  spokesmen  of  the  German  bourgeoisie  tried  at  first  to  kill  Das 
Kapital by silence as they had managed to do with my earlier writings As soon as they found 
that these tactics no longer fitted in with the conditions of the time they wrote under pretence of 
criticising my book prescriptions for the tranquillisation of the bourgeois mind But they found 
in the workers press  see eg Joseph Dietzgens articles in the   antagonists stronger than 
themselves to whom down to this very day they owe a reply  
An excellent Russian translation of Das Kapital appeared in the spring of  The edition of 
  copies  is  already  nearly  exhausted  As  early  as    N  Sieber  Professor  of  Political 
Economy  in  the  University  of  Kiev  in  his  work  David  Ricardos  Theory  of  Value  and  of 
Capital  referred  to  my  theory  of  value  of  money  and  of  capital  as  in  its  fundamentals  a 
necessary  sequel  to  the  teaching  of  Smith  and  Ricardo  That  which  astonishes  the  Western 
European in the reading of this excellent work is the authors consistent and firm grasp of the 
purely theoretical position   
That the method employed in Das Kapital has been little understood is shown by the various 
conceptions contradictory one to another that have been formed of it  
Thus  the  Paris  Revue  Positiviste  reproaches  me  in  that  on  the  one  hand  I  treat  economics 
metaphysically and on the other hand  imagine  confine myself to the mere critical analysis of 
actual  facts  instead  of  writing  receipts  Comtist  ones  for  the  cookshops  of  the  future  In 
answer to the reproach in re metaphysics Professor Sieber has it 

 

 

 

Afterword to the Second German Edition  

In so far as it deals with actual theory the method of Marx is the deductive 
method of the whole English school a school whose failings and virtues are 
common to the best theoretic economists  

M Block  Les Thoriciens du Socialisme en Allemagne Extrait du Journal des Economistes 
Juillet et Aot   makes the discovery that my method is analytic and says Par cet ouvrage 
M Marx se classe parmi les esprits analytiques les plus eminents German reviews of course 
shriek  out  at  Hegelian  sophistics  The  European  Messenger  of  St  Petersburg  in  an  article 
dealing exclusively with the method of Das Kapital May number  pp  finds 
my method of inquiry severely realistic but my method of presentation unfortunately German
dialectical It says 

At first sight if the judgment is based on the external form of the presentation of 
the subject Marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers always in the German 
ie the bad sense of the word But in point of fact he is infinitely more realistic 
than all his forerunners in the work of economic criticism He can in no sense be 
called an idealist 

I cannot answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from his own criticism which may 
interest some of my readers to whom the Russian original is inaccessible 
After a quotation from the preface to my Criticism of Political Economy Berlin  pp IV
VII where I discuss the materialistic basis of my method the writer goes on  

The one thing which is of moment to Marx is to find the law of the phenomena 
with whose investigation he is concerned and not only is that law of moment to 
him which governs these phenomena in so far as they have a definite form and 
mutual connexion within a given historical period Of still greater moment to him 
is the law of their variation of their development ie of their transition from one 
form into another from one series of connexions into a different one This law 
once discovered he investigates in detail the effects in which it manifests itself in 
social life Consequently Marx only troubles himself about one thing to show by 
rigid scientific investigation the necessity of successive determinate orders of 
social conditions and to establish as impartially as possible the facts that serve 
him for fundamental startingpoints For this it is quite enough if he proves at the 
same time both the necessity of the present order of things and the necessity of 
another order into which the first must inevitably pass over and this all the same 
whether men believe or do not believe it whether they are conscious or 
unconscious of it Marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history 
governed by laws not only independent of human will consciousness and 
intelligence but rather on the contrary determining that will consciousness and 
intelligence  If in the history of civilisation the conscious element plays a part 
so subordinate then it is selfevident that a critical inquiry whose subjectmatter is 
civilisation can less than anything else have for its basis any form of or any 
result of consciousness That is to say that not the idea but the material 
phenomenon alone can serve as its startingpoint Such an inquiry will confine 
itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact not with ideas but with 
another fact For this inquiry the one thing of moment is that both facts be 
investigated as accurately as possible and that they actually form each with 
respect to the other different momenta of an evolution but most important of all 
is the rigid analysis of the series of successions of the sequences and 
concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present

themselves But it will be said the general laws of economic life are one and the 
same no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past This Marx 
directly denies According to him such abstract laws do not exist On the 
contrary in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own  As soon as 
society has outlived a given period of development and is passing over from one 
given stage to another it begins to be subject also to other laws In a word 
economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of evolution in 
other branches of biology The old economists misunderstood the nature of 
economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry A 
more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among 
themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals Nay one and the same 
phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the different 
structure of those organisms as a whole of the variations of their individual 
organs of the different conditions in which those organs function c Marx eg 
denies that the law of population is the same at all times and in all places He 
asserts on the contrary that every stage of development has its own law of 
population  With the varying degree of development of productive power 
social conditions and the laws governing them vary too Whilst Marx sets himself 
the task of following and explaining from this point of view the economic system 
established by the sway of capital he is only formulating in a strictly scientific 
manner the aim that every accurate investigation into economic life must have 
The scientific value of such an inquiry lies in the disclosing of the special laws 
that regulate the origin existence development death of a given social organism 
and its replacement by another and higher one And it is this value that in point of 
fact Marxs book has  

Whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method in this striking and as far as 
concerns  my  own  application  of  it  generous  way  what  else  is  he  picturing  but  the  dialectic 
method  
Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry The latter has to 
appropriate the material in detail to analyse its different forms of development to trace out their 
inner connexion Only after this work is done can the actual movement be adequately described 
If this is done successfully if the life of the subjectmatter is ideally reflected as in a mirror then 
it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction  
My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian but is its direct opposite To Hegel 
the life process of the human brain ie the process of thinking which under the name of the 
Idea he even transforms into an independent subject is the demiurgos of the real world and the 
real world is only the external phenomenal form of the Idea With me on the contrary the 
ideal is  nothing  else  than the  material  world reflected  by  the  human  mind  and  translated  into 
forms of thought  
The mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic I criticised nearly thirty years ago at a time when it was 
still the fashion But just as I was working at the first volume of Das Kapital it was the good 
pleasure of the peevish arrogant mediocre  Epigones  Bchner Dhring and others 
who  now  talk  large  in  cultured  Germany  to  treat  Hegel  in  same  way  as  the  brave  Moses 
Mendelssohn in Lessings time treated Spinoza ie as a dead dog I therefore openly avowed 
myself the pupil of that mighty thinker and even here and there in the chapter on the theory of 
value coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar to him The mystification which dialectic 
suffers in Hegels hands by no means prevents him from being the first to present its general 
 

 

Afterword to the Second German Edition  
 
form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner With him it is standing on its head It 
must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical 
shell  
In its mystified form dialectic became the fashion in Germany because it seemed to transfigure 
and to glorify the existing state of things In its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to 
bourgeoisdom  and  its  doctrinaire  professors  because  it  includes  in  its  comprehension  and 
affirmative recognition of the existing state of things at the same time also the recognition of the 
negation  of  that  state  of  its  inevitable  breaking  up  because  it  regards  every  historically 
developed social form as in fluid movement and therefore takes into account its transient nature 
not less than its momentary existence because it lets nothing impose upon it and is in its essence 
critical and revolutionary  
The contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the 
practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle through which modern 
industry  runs  and  whose  crowning  point  is  the  universal  crisis  That  crisis  is  once  again 
approaching although as yet but in its preliminary stage and by the universality of its theatre and 
the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroomupstarts of 
the new holy PrussoGerman empire

Afterword to the French Edition  

Mr J Roy set himself the task of producing a version that would be as exact and even literal as 
possible and has scrupulously fulfilled it But his very scrupulosity has compelled me to modify 
his text with a view to rendering it more intelligible to the reader These alterations introduced 
from day to day as the book was published in parts were not made with equal care and were 
bound to result in a lack of harmony in style 
Having once undertaken this work of revision I was led to apply it also to the basic original text 
the second German edition to simplify some arguments to complete others to give additional 
historical  or  statistical  material  to  add  critical  suggestions  etc  Hence  whatever  the  literary 
defects of this French edition may be it possesses a scientific value independent of the original 
and should be consulted even by readers familiar with German

Preface to the Third German Edition  

Marx was not destined to get this the third edition ready for press himself The powerful thinker 
to whose greatness even his opponents now make obeisance died on March   
Upon me who in Marx lost the best the truest friend I had  and had for forty years  the friend to 
whom I am more indebted than can be expressed in words  upon me now devolved the duty of 
attending to the publication of this third edition as well as of the second volume which Marx had 
left  behind  in  manuscript  I  must  now  account  here  to  the  reader  for  the  way  in  which  I 
discharged the first part of my duty 
It was Marxs original intention to rewrite a great part of the text of Volume I to formulate many 
theoretical points more exactly insert new ones and bring historical and statistical materials up to 
date But his ailing condition and the urgent need to do the final editing of Volume II induced him 
to give up this scheme Only the most necessary alterations were to be made only the insertions 
which the French edition Le Capital Par Karl Marx Paris Lachtre  already contained 
were to be put in 
Among the books left by Marx there was a German copy which he himself had corrected here and 
there and provided with references to the French edition also a French copy in which he had 
indicated the exact passages to be used These alterations and additions are confined with few 
exceptions to the last Engl ed second last part of the book The Accumulation of Capital 
Here  the  previous  text  followed  the  original  draft  more  closely  than  elsewhere  while  the 
preceding sections had been gone over more thoroughly The style was therefore more vivacious 
more of a single cast but also more careless studded with Anglicisms and in parts unclear there 
were  gaps  here  and  there  in  the  presentation  of  arguments  some  important  particulars  being 
merely alluded to 
With regard to the style Marx had himself thoroughly revised several subsections and thereby 
had indicated to me here as well as in numerous oral suggestions the length to which I could go 
in eliminating English technical terms and other Anglicisms Marx would in any event have gone 
over  the  additions  and  supplemental  texts  and  have  replaced  the  smooth  French  with  his  own 
terse German I had to be satisfied when transferring them with bringing them into maximum 
harmony with the original text 
Thus  not  a  single  word  was  changed  in this  third  edition  without  my  firm  conviction  that  the 
author would have altered it himself It would never occur to me to introduce into Das Kapital 
the current jargon in which German economists are wont to express themselves  that gibberish in 
which for instance one who for cash has others give him their labour is called a labourgiver 
Arbeitgeber and one whose labour is taken away from him for wages is called a labourtaker 
Arbeitnehmer  In  French  too  the  word  travail  is  used  in  everyday  life  in  the  sense  of 
occupation  But  the  French  would  rightly  consider  any  economist  crazy  should  he  call  the 
capitalist a donneur de travail a labourgiver or the worker a receveur de travail a labourtaker 
Nor have I taken the liberty to convert the English coins and moneys measures and weights used 
throughout the text to their newGerman equivalents When the first edition appeared there were 
as many kinds of measures and weights in Germany as there are days in the year Besides there 
were two kinds of marks the Reichsmark existed at the time only in the imagination of Soetbeer 
who  had  invented it in the  late  thirties  two  kinds  of  gulden  and  at  least  three  kinds  of taler 
including one called neues Zweidrittel In the natural sciences the metric system prevailed in the 
world  market    English  measures  and  weights  Under  such  circumstances  English  units  of 
 

 

Preface to the Third German Edition  
 
measure  were  quite  natural  for a  book  which  had to  take  its  factual  proofs  almost  exclusively 
from  British  industrial  relations  The  lastnamed  reason  is  decisive  even  today  especially 
because  the  corresponding  relations  in  the  world  market  have  hardly  changed  and  English 
weights and measures almost completely control precisely the key industries iron and cotton 
In conclusion a few words on Marxs art of quotation which is so little understood When they 
are  pure  statements  of  fact  or  descriptions  the  quotations  from  the  English  Blue  books  for 
example serve of course as simple documentary proof But this is not so when the theoretical 
views of other economists are cited Here the quotation is intended merely to state where when 
and  by  whom  an  economic  idea  conceived  in  the  course  of  development  was  first  clearly 
enunciated Here the only consideration is that the economic conception in question must be of 
some  significance  to  the  history  of  science  that  it  is  the  more  or  less  adequate  theoretical 
expression of the economic situation of its time But whether this conception still possesses any 
absolute or relative validity from the standpoint of the author or whether it already has become 
wholly past history is quite immaterial Hence these quotations are only a running commentary to 
the text a commentary borrowed from the history of economic science and establish the dates 
and originators of certain of the more important advances in economic theory And that was a 
very necessary thing in a science whose historians have so far distinguished themselves only by 
tendentious ignorance  characteristic  of  careerists  It  will  now  be  understandable  why  Marx  in 
consonance with the Afterword to the second edition only in very exceptional cases had occasion 
to quote German economists 
There is hope that the second volume will appear in the course of

Preface to the English Edition Engels  

The publication of an English version of Das Kapital needs no apology On the contrary an 
explanation might be expected why this English version has been delayed until now seeing that 
for some years past the theories advocated in this book have been constantly referred to attacked 
and defended interpreted and misinterpreted in the periodical press and the current literature of 
both England and America 
When soon after the authors death in  it became evident that an English edition of the work 
was  really  required  Mr  Samuel  Moore  for  many  years  a  friend  of  Marx  and  of  the  present 
writer  and than  whom  perhaps  no one is  more  conversant  with  the  book  itself  consented  to 
undertake  the  translation  which  the  literary  executors  of  Marx  were  anxious  to  lay  before  the 
public It was understood that I should compare the MS with the original work and suggest such 
alterations  as  I  might  deem  advisable  When  by  and  by  it  was  found  that  Mr  Moores 
professional  occupations  prevented  him  from  finishing  the  translation  as  quickly  as  we  all 
desired we gladly accepted Dr Avelings offer to undertake a portion of the work at the same 
time Mrs Aveling Marxs youngest daughter offered to check the quotations and to restore the 
original text of the numerous passages taken from English authors and Blue books and translated 
by Marx into German This has been done throughout with but a few unavoidable exceptions 
The following portions of the book have been translated by Dr Aveling I Chapters X The 
Working  day  and  XI  Rate  and  Mass  of  SurplusValue    Part  VI  Wages  comprising 
Chapters XIX to XXII  from Chapter XXIV Section  Circumstances that c to the end 
of the book comprising the latter part of Chapter XXIV Chapter XXV and the whole of Part 
VIII Chapters XXVI to XXXIII  the two Authors prefaces All the rest of the book has 
been done by Mr Moore While thus each of the translators is responsible for his share of the 
work only I bear a joint responsibility for the whole 
The third German edition which has been made the basis of our work throughout was prepared 
by  me  in    with the assistance  of  notes left  by  the  author  indicating  the  passages  of  the 
second edition to be replaced by designated passages from the French text published in  
The alterations thus effected in the text of the second edition generally coincided with changes 
prescribed by Marx in a set of MS instructions for an English translation that was planned about 
ten years ago in America but abandoned chiefly for want of a fit and proper translator This MS 
was placed at our disposal by our old friend Mr F A Sorge of Hoboken N J It designates some 
further  interpolations  from  the  French  edition  but  being  so  many  years  older  than  the  final 
instructions for the third edition I did not consider myself at liberty to make use of it otherwise 
than  sparingly  and  chiefly  in  cases  where  it  helped us  over  difficulties  In  the  same  way  the 
French text  has  been  referred  to  in  most  of  the  difficult  passages  as  an  indicator  of  what  the 
author himself was prepared to sacrifice wherever something of the full import of the original had 
to be sacrificed in the rendering 
There is however one difficulty we could not spare the reader the use of certain terms in a sense 
different from what they have not only in common life but in ordinary Political Economy But 
this was unavoidable Every new aspect of a science involves a revolution in the technical terms 
of that science This is best shown by chemistry where the whole of the terminology is radically 
changed about once in twenty years and where you will hardly find a single organic compound 
that has not gone through a whole series of different names Political Economy has generally been 
content to take just as they were the terms of commercial and industrial life and to operate with 

 

 

Preface to the English Edition Engels  
 
them entirely failing to see that by so doing it confined itself within the narrow circle of ideas 
expressed by those terms Thus though perfectly aware that both profits and rent are but sub
divisions fragments of that unpaid part of the product which the labourer has to supply to his 
employer  its  first  appropriator  though  not  its  ultimate  exclusive  owner  yet  even  classical 
Political Economy never went beyond the received notions of profits and rents never examined 
this unpaid part of the product called by Marx surplusproduct in its integrity as a whole and 
therefore never arrived at a clear comprehension either of its origin and nature or of the laws that 
regulate  the  subsequent  distribution  of  its  value  Similarly  all  industry  not  agricultural  or 
handicraft is indiscriminately comprised in the term of manufacture and thereby the distinction 
is obliterated between two great and essentially different periods of economic history the period 
of manufacture proper based on the division of manual labour and the period of modern industry 
based  on  machinery  It  is  however  self  evident  that  a  theory  which  views  modern  capitalist 
production as a mere passing stage in the economic history of mankind must make use of terms 
different from those habitual to writers who look upon that form of production as imperishable 
and final 
A word respecting the authors  method of quoting may not be out of place In the majority of 
cases the quotations serve in the usual way as documentary evidence in support of assertions 
made in the text But in many instances passages from economic writers are quoted in order to 
indicate  when  where  and  by  whom  a  certain  proposition  was  for  the  first  time  clearly 
enunciated This is done in cases where the proposition quoted is of importance as being a more 
or less adequate expression of the conditions of social production and exchange prevalent at the 
time  and  quite  irrespective  of  Marxs  recognition  or  otherwise  of  its  general  validity  These 
quotations therefore supplement the text by a running commentary taken from the history of the 
science 
Our translation comprises the first book of the work only But this first book is in a great measure 
a  whole  in  itself  and  has for  twenty  years  ranked  as  an  independent  work  The  second  book 
edited in  German  by  me  in   is  decidedly  incomplete  without  the  third which  cannot  be 
published before the end of  When Book III has been brought out in the original German it 
will then be soon enough to think about preparing an English edition of both 
Das  Kapital  is  often  called  on  the  Continent  the  Bible  of  the  working  class  That  the 
conclusions arrived at in this work are daily more and more becoming the fundamental principles 
of the great working class movement not only in Germany and Switzerland but in France in 
Holland and Belgium in America and even in Italy and Spain that everywhere the working class 
more and more recognises in these conclusions the most adequate expression of its condition 
and of its aspirations nobody acquainted with that movement will deny And in England too the 
theories of Marx even at this moment exercise a powerful influence upon the socialist movement 
which is spreading in the ranks of cultured people no less than in those of the working class 
But that is not all The time is rapidly approaching when a thorough examination of Englands 
economic  position  will  impose  itself  as  an  irresistible  national  necessity  The  working  of  the 
industrial  system  of  this  country  impossible  without  a  constant  and  rapid  extension  of 
production and therefore of markets is coming to a dead stop 
Free  Trade  has  exhausted  its  resources  even  Manchester  doubts  this  its  quondam  economic 
gospel  Foreign industry rapidly developing stares English production in the face everywhere 
not only in protected but also in neutral markets and even on this side of the Channel While the 
productive  power  increases  in  a  geometric  the  extension  of  markets  proceeds  at  best  in  an 
arithmetic ratio The decennial cycle of stagnation prosperity overproduction and crisis ever 
recurrent  from    to    seems  indeed  to  have  run  its  course  but  only  to  land  us  in  the

slough of despond of a permanent and chronic depression The sighed for period of prosperity 
will not come as often as we seem to perceive its heralding symptoms so often do they again 
vanish into air Meanwhile each succeeding winter brings up afresh the great question what to 
do with the unemployed but while the number of the unemployed keeps swelling from year to 
year there is nobody to answer that question and we can almost calculate the moment when the 
unemployed  losing  patience  will  take  their  own  fate  into  their  own  hands  Surely  at  such  a 
moment the voice ought to be heard of a man whose whole theory is the result of a lifelong study 
of the economic history and condition of England and whom that study led to the conclusion that 
at least in Europe England is the only country where the inevitable social revolution might be 
effected  entirely  by  peaceful  and  legal  means  He  certainly  never  forgot to add  that  he  hardly 
expected the English ruling classes to submit without a proslavery rebellion to this peaceful 
and legal revolution

Preface to the Fourth German Edition 

Engels  

The fourth edition required that I should establish in final form as nearly as possible both text 
and footnotes The following brief explanation will show how I have fulfilled this task 
After  again  comparing  the  French  edition  and  Marxs  manuscript  remarks  I  have  made  some 
further  additions  to  the  German  text  from  that  translation  They  will  be  found  on  p    rd 
edition p  present edition pp  pp  rd edition pp  present edition 
pp      pp    rd  edition  p    present  edition  pp    pp    rd 
edition p  present edition  and p  rd edition p  present edition p  
in Note  I have also followed the example of the French and English editions by putting the 
long  footnote  on  the  miners  into  the  text  rd  edition  pp    th  edition  pp   
present edition pp  Other small alterations are of a purely technical nature 
Further  I  have  added  a  few  more  explanatory  notes  especially  where  changed  historical 
conditions seemed to demand this All these additional notes are enclosed in square brackets and 
marked either with my initials or D H  
Meanwhile  a  complete  revision  of  the  numerous  quotations  had  been  made  necessary  by  the 
publication of the English edition For this edition Marxs youngest daughter Eleanor undertook 
to compare all the quotations with their originals so that those taken from English sources which 
constitute  the  vast  majority  are  given  there  not  as  retranslations  from  the  German  but  in  the 
original  English  form  In  preparing  the  fourth  edition  it  was  therefore  incumbent  upon  me  to 
consult  this  text  The  comparison  revealed  various  small  inaccuracies  Page  numbers  wrongly 
indicated  due  partly  to  mistakes  in  copying  from  notebooks  and  partly  to  the  accumulated 
misprints  of  three  editions  misplaced  quotation  or  omission  marks  which  cannot  be  avoided 
when a mass of quotations is copied from notebook extracts here and there some rather unhappy 
translation of a word particular passages quoted from the old Paris notebooks of  when 
Marx did not know English and was reading English economists in French translations so that 
the double translation yielded a slightly different shade of meaning eg in the case of Steuart 
Ure  etc  where  the  English  text  had  now  to  be  used    and  other  similar  instances  of  trifling 
inaccuracy or negligence But anyone who compares the fourth edition with the previous ones can 
convince  himself  that  all  this  laborious  process  of  emendation  has  not  produced  the  smallest 
change in the book worth speaking of There was only one quotation which could not be traced  
the one from Richard Jones th edition p  note  Marx probably slipped up when writing 
down the title of the book All the other quotations retain their cogency in full or have enhanced 
it due to their present exact form 
Here however I am obliged to revert to an old story 
I know of only one case in which the accuracy of a quotation given by Marx has been called in 
question But as the issue dragged beyond his lifetime I cannot well ignore it here 
On March   there appeared in the Berlin Concordia organ of the German Manufacturers 
Association an anonymous article entitled How Karl Marx Quotes It was here asserted with 
an  effervescence  of  moral  indignation  and  unparliamentary  language  that  the  quotation  from 
Gladstones  Budget  Speech  of  April      in  the  Inaugural  Address  of  the  International 
Workingmens Association  and repeated in Capital Vol I p  th edition p  
rd edition present edition p  had been falsified that not a single word of the sentence 

 

 

Preface to the Fourth German Edition Engels  
 
this  intoxicating  augmentation  of  wealth  and  power    is    entirely  confined  to  classes  of 
property  was  to  be  found  in  the  semiofficial  stenographic  report  in  Hansard  But  this 
sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstones speech Exactly the opposite is stated there In 
bold type This sentence both in form and substance is a lie inserted by Marx 
Marx to whom the number of Concordia was sent the following May answered the anonymous 
author in the Volksstaat of June st As he could not recall which newspaper report he had used 
for the  quotation  he limited  himself to  citing  first  the  equivalent  quotation from  two  English 
publications and then the report in The Times according to which Gladstone says 
That is the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country I must say for one I should 
look almost with apprehension and with pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and 
power if it were my belief that it was confined to classes who are in easy circumstances This 
takes no cognisance at all of the condition of the labouring population The augmentation I have 
described  and  which  is  founded  I  think  upon  accurate  returns  is  an  augmentation  entirely 
confined to classes possessed of property 
Thus  Gladstone  says  here  that  he  would  be  sorry  if  it  were  so  but  it  is  so  this  intoxicating 
augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property And as to the semi
official  Hansard  Marx  goes  on  to  say  In  the  version  which  he  afterwards  manipulated 
zurechtgestmpert  Mr  Gladstone  was  astute  enough  to  obliterate  wegzupfuschen  this 
passage  which  coming  from  an  English  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer  was  certainly 
compromising  This  by  the  way  is  a  traditional  usage  in  the  English  parliament  and  not  an 
invention gotten up by little Lasker against Bebel 
The anonymous writer gets angrier and angrier In his answer in Concordia July th he sweeps 
aside secondhand sources and demurely suggests that it is the custom to quote parliamentary 
speeches from the stenographic report adding however that The Times report which includes 
the falsified sentence and the Hansard report which omits it are substantially in complete 
agreement  while  The  Times  report  likewise  contains  the  exact  opposite  to  that  notorious 
passage in the Inaugural Address This fellow carefully conceals the fact that The Times report 
explicitly  includes  that  selfsame  notorious  passage  alongside  of  its  alleged  opposite 
Despite all this however the anonymous one feels that he is stuck fast and that only some new 
dodge  can  save  him  Thus  whilst  his  article  bristles  as  we  have  just  shown  with  impudent 
mendacity  and  is  interlarded  with  such  edifying  terms  of  abuse  as  bad  faith  dishonesty 
lying  allegation  that  spurious  quotation  impudent  mendacity  a  quotation  entirely 
falsified this falsification simply infamous etc he finds it necessary to divert the issue to 
another domain and therefore promises to explain in a second article the meaning which we the 
nonmendacious  anonymous  one  attribute  to  the  content  of  Gladstones  words  As  if  his 
particular opinion of no decisive value as it is had anything whatever to do with the matter This 
second article was printed in Concordia on July th 
Marx replied again in the Volksstaat of August th now giving also the reports of the passage in 
question from the Morning Star and the Morning Advertiser of April   According to both 
reports  Gladstone  said  that  he  would  look  with  apprehension  etc  upon  this  intoxicating 
augmentation  of  wealth  and  power  if  he  believed  it  to  be  confined  to  classes  in  easy 
circumstances  But  this  augmentation  was  in  fact  entirely  confined  to  classes  possessed  of 
property  So  these  reports  too  reproduced  word  for  word  the  sentence  alleged  to  have  been 
lyingly inserted Marx further established once more by a comparison of The Times and the 
Hansard texts that this sentence which three newspaper reports of identical content appearing 
independently of one another the next morning proved to have been really uttered was missing 
from the Hansard report revised according to the familiar custom and that Gladstone to use

Marxs words had afterwards conjured it away In conclusion Marx stated that he had no time 
for further intercourse with the anonymous one The latter also seems to have had enough at any 
rate Marx received no further issues of Concordia 
With this the matter appeared to be dead and buried True once or twice later on there reached us 
from persons in touch with the University of Cambridge mysterious rumours of an unspeakable 
literary  crime  which  Marx  was  supposed  to  have  committed  in  Capital  but  despite  all 
investigation nothing more definite could be learned Then on November   eight months 
after Marxs death there appeared in The Times a letter headed Trinity College Cambridge and 
signed Sedley Taylor in which this little man who dabbles in the mildest sort of cooperative 
affairs seizing  upon some  chance  pretext  or  other  at last enlightened  us  not only  concerning 
those vague Cambridge rumours but also the anonymous one in Concordia 
What  appears  extremely  singular  says  the  little  man  from  Trinity  College  is  that  it  was 
reserved for Professor Brentano then of the University of Breslau now of that of Strassburg to 
expose  the  bad  faith  which  had  manifestly  dictated  the  citation  made  from  Mr  Gladstones 
speech in the Inaugural Address Herr Karl Marx who  attempted to defend the citation had 
the hardihood in the deadly shifts to which Brentanos masterly conduct of the attack speedily 
reduced him to assert that Mr Gladstone had manipulated the report of his speech in The Times 
of April   before it appeared in Hansard in order to obliterate a passage which was 
certainly compromising for an English Chancellor of the Exchequer On Brentanos showing by 
a detailed comparison of texts that the reports of The Times and of Hansard agreed in utterly 
excluding  the  meaning  which  craftily  isolated  quotation  had  put  upon  Mr  Gladstones  words 
Marx withdrew from further controversy under the plea of want of time 
So that was at the bottom of the whole business And thus was the anonymous campaign of Herr 
Brentano  in  Concordia  gloriously  reflected  in  the  productively  cooperating  imagination  of 
Cambridge Thus he stood sword in hand and thus he battled in his masterly conduct of the 
attack  this  St  George  of  the  German  Manufacturers  Association  whilst  the infernal  dragon 
Marx in deadly shifts speedily breathed his last at his feet 
All this  Ariostian  battle  scene  however  only  serves to  conceal the  dodges of our  St  George 
Here  there  is  no  longer  talk  of  lying  insertion  or  falsification  but  of  craftily  isolated 
quotation  The  whole  issue  was  shifted  and  St  George  and  his  Cambridge  squire  very  well 
knew why 
Eleanor Marx replied in the monthly journal Today February  as The Times refused to 
publish her letter She once more focussed the debate on the sole question at issue had Marx 
lyingly inserted that sentence or not To this Mr Sedley Taylor answered that the question 
whether a particular sentence did or did not occur in Mr Gladstones speech had been in his 
opinion of very subordinate importance in the BrentanoMarx controversy compared to the 
issue whether the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of conveying or of perverting 
Mr Gladstones meaning He then admits that The Times report contains a verbal contrariety 
but if the context is rightly interpreted ie in the Gladstonian Liberal sense it shows what Mr 
Gladstone  meant  to  say  Today  March    The  most  comic  point  here  is  that  our  little 
Cambridge  man  now  insists  upon  quoting  the  speech  not  from  Hansard  as  according  to  the 
anonymous  Brentano  it  is  customary  to  do  but  from  The  Times  report  which  the  same 
Brentano had characterised as necessarily bungling Naturally so for in Hansard the vexatious 
sentence is missing 
Eleanor Marx had no difficulty in the same issue of Today in dissolving all this argumentation 
into  thin  air  Either  Mr  Taylor  had  read  the  controversy  of    in  which  case  he  was  now 
making not only lying insertions but also lying suppressions or he had not read it and ought 
 

 

Preface to the Fourth German Edition Engels  
 
to remain silent In either case it was certain that he did not dare to maintain for a moment the 
accusation of his friend Brentano that Marx had made a lying addition On the contrary Marx 
it now seems had not lyingly added but suppressed an important sentence But this same sentence 
is quoted on page  of the Inaugural Address a few lines before the alleged lying insertion 
And as to the contrariety in Gladstones speech is it not Marx himself who in Capital p  
rd edition p  note  present edition p  Note  refers to the continual crying 
contradictions in Gladstones Budget speeches of  and  Only he does not presume  la 
Mr  Sedley  Taylor  to  resolve  them  into  complacent  Liberal  sentiments  Eleanor  Marx  in 
concluding her reply finally sums up as follows 
Marx has not suppressed anything worth quoting neither has he lyingly added anything But 
he has restored rescued from oblivion a particular sentence of one of Mr Gladstones speeches 
a sentence which had indubitably been pronounced but which somehow or other had found its 
way  out of Hansard 
With  that  Mr  Sedley  Taylor  too  had  had  enough  and  the  result  of  this  whole  professorial 
cobweb spun out over two decades and two great countries is that nobody has since dared to cast 
any  other  aspersion  upon  Marxs  literary  honesty  whilst  Mr  Sedley  Taylor  no  doubt  will 
hereafter put as little confidence in the literary war bulletins of Herr Brentano as Herr Brentano 
will in the papal infallibility of Hansard

Section  The Two Factors of a Commodity 

UseValue and Value 

The Substance of Value and the Magnitude of Value 

The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails presents itself 
as  an  immense  accumulation  of  commodities  its  unit  being  a  single  commodity  Our 
investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity  
A commodity is in the first place an object outside us a thing that by its properties satisfies 
human wants of some sort or another The nature of such wants whether for instance they spring 
from the stomach or from fancy makes no difference Neither are we here concerned to know 
how the object satisfies these wants whether directly as means of subsistence or indirectly as 
means of production  
Every useful thing as iron paper c may be looked at from the two points of view of quality 
and quantity It is an assemblage of many properties and may therefore be of use in various ways 
To discover the various uses of things is the work of history So also is the establishment of 
sociallyrecognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects The diversity 
of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured partly 
in convention  
The utility of a thing makes it a use value But this utility is not a thing of air Being limited by 
the  physical  properties  of  the  commodity  it  has  no  existence  apart  from  that  commodity  A 
commodity such as iron corn or a diamond is therefore so far as it is a material thing a use 
value something useful This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour 
required to appropriate its useful qualities When treating of use value we always assume to be 
dealing with definite quantities such as dozens of watches yards of linen or tons of iron The use 
values of commodities furnish the material for a special study that of the commercial knowledge 
of commodities Use values become a reality only by use or consumption they also constitute 
the substance of all wealth whatever may be the social form of that wealth In the form of society 
we are about to consider they are in addition the material depositories of exchange value  
Exchange value at first sight presents itself as a quantitative relation as the proportion in which 
values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort a relation constantly changing 
with  time  and  place  Hence  exchange  value  appears  to  be  something  accidental  and  purely 
relative and consequently an intrinsic value ie an exchange value that is inseparably connected 
with inherent in commodities seems a contradiction in terms Let us consider the matter a little 
more closely  
A given commodity eg a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking y silk or z gold c  
in short for other commodities in the most different proportions Instead of one exchange value 
the wheat has therefore a great many But since x blacking y silk or z gold c each represents 
the exchange value of one quarter of wheat x blacking y silk z gold c must as exchange 
values be replaceable by each other or equal to each other Therefore first the valid exchange 
values of a given commodity express something equal secondly exchange value generally is 
only  the  mode  of  expression  the  phenomenal  form  of  something  contained  in  it  yet 
distinguishable from it  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Let  us  take  two  commodities  eg  corn  and  iron  The  proportions  in  which  they  are 
exchangeable whatever those proportions may be can always be represented by an equation in 
which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron eg  quarter corn  x cwt 
iron What does this equation tell us It tells us that in two different things  in  quarter of corn 
and x cwt of iron there exists in equal quantities something common to both The two things 
must therefore be equal to a third which in itself is neither the one nor the other Each of them so 
far as it is exchange value must therefore be reducible to this third  
A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear In order to calculate and compare the areas 
of  rectilinear  figures  we  decompose  them  into  triangles  But  the  area  of  the  triangle  itself  is 
expressed by something totally different from its visible figure namely by half the product of the 
base multiplied by the altitude In the same way the exchange values of commodities must be 
capable  of  being  expressed  in  terms  of  something  common  to  them  all  of  which  thing  they 
represent a greater or less quantity  
This  common  something  cannot  be  either  a  geometrical  a  chemical  or  any  other  natural 
property  of  commodities  Such  properties  claim  our  attention  only  in  so  far  as  they  affect  the 
utility  of  those  commodities  make  them  use  values  But  the  exchange  of  commodities  is 
evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value Then one use value is just as 
good as another provided only it be present in sufficient quantity Or as old Barbon says 

one sort of wares are as good as another if the values be equal There is no 
difference or distinction in things of equal value  An hundred pounds worth of 
lead or iron is of as great value as one hundred pounds worth of silver or gold 

As use values commodities are above all of different qualities but as exchange values they are 
merely different quantities and consequently do not contain an atom of use value  
If then we leave out of consideration the use value of commodities they have only one common 
property left that of being products of labour But even the product of labour itself has undergone 
a change in our hands If we make abstraction from its use value we make abstraction at the same 
time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use value we see in it no 
longer a table a house yarn or any other useful thing Its existence as a material thing is put out 
of  sight  Neither  can  it  any  longer  be  regarded  as  the  product  of  the  labour  of  the  joiner  the 
mason  the  spinner  or  of  any  other  definite  kind  of  productive  labour  Along  with  the  useful 
qualities of the products themselves we put out of sight both the useful character of the various 
kinds of labour embodied in them and the concrete forms of that labour there is nothing left but 
what is common to them all all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour human labour in 
the abstract  
Let us now consider the residue of each of these products it consists of the same unsubstantial 
reality  in  each  a  mere  congelation  of  homogeneous  human  labour  of  labour power  expended 
without regard to the mode of its expenditure All that these things now tell us is that human 
labour  power  has  been  expended  in  their  production  that  human  labour  is  embodied in  them 
When looked at as crystals of this social substance common to them all they are  Values  
We  have  seen  that  when  commodities  are  exchanged  their  exchange  value  manifests  itself  as 
something totally independent of their use value But if we abstract from their use value there 
remains their Value as defined above Therefore the common substance that manifests itself in 
the exchange value of commodities whenever they are exchanged is their value The progress of 
our  investigation  will  show  that  exchange  value  is  the  only  form  in  which  the  value  of 
commodities can manifest itself or be expressed For the present however we have to consider 
the nature of value independently of this its form  

 

 

Chapter  
 
A use value or useful article therefore has value only because human labour in the abstract has 
been embodied or materialised in it How then is the magnitude of this value to be measured 
Plainly by the quantity of the valuecreating substance the labour contained in the article The 
quantity  of  labour  however  is  measured  by  its  duration  and  labour  time  in  its  turn  finds  its 
standard in weeks days and hours  
Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour 
spent on it the more idle and unskilful the labourer the more valuable would his commodity be 
because  more  time  would  be  required  in  its  production  The  labour  however  that  forms  the 
substance of value is homogeneous human labour expenditure of one uniform labour power The 
total labour power of society which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities 
produced  by  that  society  counts  here  as  one  homogeneous  mass  of  human  labour  power 
composed though it be of innumerable individual units Each of these units is the same as any 
other so far as it has the character of the average labour power of society and takes effect as 
such that is so far as it requires for producing a commodity no more time than is needed on an 
average no more than is socially necessary The labour time socially necessary is that required to 
produce an article under the normal conditions of production and with the average degree of skill 
and  intensity  prevalent  at  the  time  The  introduction  of  powerlooms  into  England  probably 
reduced by onehalf the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth The hand
loom weavers as a matter of fact continued to require the same time as before but for all that 
the product of one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hours social 
labour and consequently fell to onehalf its former value  
We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of 
labour  socially  necessary  or  the  labour  time  socially  necessary  for  its  production  Each 
individual commodity in this connexion is to be considered as an average sample of its class 
Commodities  therefore  in  which  equal  quantities  of  labour  are  embodied  or  which  can  be 
produced in the same time have the same value The value of one commodity is to the value of 
any other as the labour time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the 
production of the other As values all commodities are only definite masses of congealed labour 
time 
The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant if the labour time required for its 
production  also  remained  constant  But  the  latter  changes  with  every  variation  in  the 
productiveness of labour This productiveness is determined by various circumstances amongst 
others by the average amount of skill of the workmen the state of science and the degree of its 
practical  application  the  social  organisation  of  production  the  extent  and  capabilities  of  the 
means  of  production  and  by  physical  conditions  For  example  the  same  amount  of  labour  in 
favourable seasons is embodied in  bushels of corn and in unfavourable only in four The same 
labour extracts  from  rich mines  more  metal than from  poor  mines  Diamonds are  of  very  rare 
occurrence on the earths surface and hence their discovery costs on an average a great deal of 
labour time Consequently much labour is represented in a small compass Jacob doubts whether 
gold has ever been paid for at its full value This applies still more to diamonds According to 
Eschwege the total produce of the Brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years ending in  
had  not  realised  the  price  of  oneandahalf  years  average  produce  of  the  sugar  and  coffee 
plantations  of the  same  country  although  the  diamonds  cost  much  more  labour  and therefore 
represented more value With richer mines the same quantity of labour would embody itself in 
more diamonds and their value would fall If we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour 
in converting carbon into diamonds their value might fall below that of bricks In general the 
greater the productiveness of labour the less is the labour time required for the production of an 

 

 

Chapter  
 
article the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article and the less is its value and 
vice vers the less the productiveness of labour the greater is the labour time required for the 
production of an article and the greater is its value The value of a commodity therefore varies 
directly as the quantity and inversely as the productiveness of the labour incorporated in it  
A thing can be a use value without having value This is the case whenever its utility to man is 
not due to labour Such are air virgin soil natural meadows c A thing can be useful and the 
product of human labour without being a commodity Whoever directly satisfies his wants with 
the  produce  of  his  own  labour  creates  indeed  use  values  but  not  commodities  In  order  to 
produce  the  latter  he  must  not  only  produce  use  values  but  use  values  for  others  social  use 
values And not only for others without more The mediaeval peasant produced quitrentcorn 
for his feudal lord and tithecorn for his parson But neither the quitrentcorn nor the tithecorn 
became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others To become a 
commodity a product must be transferred to another whom it will serve as a use value by means 
of an exchange Lastly nothing can have value without being an object of utility If the thing is 
useless so is the labour contained in it the labour does not count as labour and therefore creates 
no value  
Section  The Twofold Character of the Labour Embodied in 

Commodities 

At  first  sight  a  commodity  presented  itself  to  us  as  a  complex  of  two  things    use  value  and 
exchange value Later on we saw also that labour too possesses the same twofold nature for 
so far as it finds expression in value it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it 
as a creator of use values I was the first to point out and to examine critically this twofold nature 
of the labour contained in commodities As this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension 
of political economy turns we must go more into detail  
Let us take two commodities such as a coat and  yards of linen and let the former be double 
the value of the latter so that if  yards of linen  W the coat  W  
The coat is a use value that satisfies a particular want Its existence is the result of a special sort of 
productive  activity  the  nature  of  which  is  determined  by  its  aim  mode  of  operation  subject 
means and result The labour whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product 
or  which  manifests  itself  by  making  its  product  a  use  value  we  call  useful  labour  In  this 
connection we consider only its useful effect  
As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different use values so also are the two forms of 
labour  that  produce  them  tailoring  and  weaving  Were  these  two  objects  not  qualitatively 
different not produced respectively by labour of different quality they could not stand to each 
other  in  the  relation  of  commodities  Coats  are  not  exchanged  for  coats  one  use  value  is  not 
exchanged for another of the same kind  
To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful 
labour classified according to the order genus species and variety to which they belong in the 
social division of labour This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of 
commodities  but  it  does  not  follow  conversely  that  the  production  of  commodities  is  a 
                                                      
 
 The following passage occurred only in the first edition Now we know the substance of value It is labour 
We know the measure of its magnitude It is labour time The form which stamps value as exchangevalue remains to 
be  analysed  But  before  this  we  need  to  develop  the  characteristics  we  have  already  found  somewhat  more  fully 
Taken from the Penguin edition of Capital translated by Ben Fowkes 
 

 

Chapter  
 
necessary condition for the division of labour In the primitive Indian community there is social 
division of labour without production of commodities Or to take an example nearer home in 
every factory the labour is divided according to a system but this division is not brought about by 
the  operatives  mutually  exchanging  their  individual  products  Only  such  products  can  become 
commodities with regard to each other as result from different kinds of labour each kind being 
carried on independently and for the account of private individuals  
To  resume  then  In  the  use  value  of  each  commodity  there  is  contained  useful  labour  ie 
productive  activity  of  a  definite  kind  and  exercised  with  a  definite  aim  Use  values  cannot 
confront each other as commodities unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively 
different in each of them In a community the produce of which in general takes the form of 
commodities ie in a community of commodity producers this qualitative difference between 
the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently by individual producers each on their 
own account develops into a complex system a social division of labour  
Anyhow whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer in either case it operates as a 
use  value  Nor  is  the  relation  between  the  coat  and  the  labour  that  produced  it  altered  by  the 
circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade an independent branch of the social 
division of labour Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it the human race made clothes 
for thousands of years without a single man becoming a tailor But coats and linen like every 
other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature must invariably 
owe their existence to a special productive activity exercised with a definite aim an activity that 
appropriates  particular  naturegiven  materials  to  particular  human  wants  So  far  therefore  as 
labour is a creator of use value is useful labour it is a necessary condition independent of all 
forms of society for the existence of the human race it is an eternal natureimposed necessity 
without which there can be no material exchanges between man and Nature and therefore no life  
The  use  values  coat  linen  c  ie  the  bodies  of  commodities  are  combinations  of  two 
elements  matter and labour If we take away the useful labour expended upon them a material 
substratum is always left which is furnished by Nature without the help of man The latter can 
work only as Nature does that is by changing the form of matter Nay more in this work of 
changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces We see then that labour is not the 
only source of material wealth of use values produced by labour As William Petty puts it labour 
is its father and the earth its mother  
Let us now pass from the commodity considered as a use value to the value of commodities  
By our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as the linen But this is a mere quantitative 
difference which for the present does not concern us We bear in mind however that if the value 
of the coat is double that of  yds of linen  yds of linen must have the same value as one coat 
So  far  as  they  are  values  the  coat  and  the  linen  are  things  of  a  like  substance  objective 
expressions of essentially identical labour But tailoring and weaving are qualitatively different 
kinds  of  labour  There  are  however  states  of  society  in  which  one  and  the  same  man  does 
tailoring and weaving alternately in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications 
of the labour of the same individual and not special and fixed functions of different persons just 
as the coat which our tailor makes one day and the trousers which he makes another day imply 
only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual Moreover we see at a glance that 
in  our  capitalist  society  a  given  portion  of  human  labour  is  in  accordance  with  the  varying 
demand at one time supplied in the form of tailoring at another in the form of weaving This 
change may possibly not take place without friction but take place it must  
Productive  activity  if  we  leave  out  of  sight  its  special  form  viz  the  useful  character  of  the 
labour is  nothing  but the expenditure of  human  labour  power Tailoring  and weaving  though 
 

 

Chapter  
 
qualitatively different productive activities are each a productive expenditure of human brains 
nerves and muscles and in this sense are human labour They are but two different modes of 
expending human labour power Of course this labour power which remains the same under all 
its modifications must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in 
a multiplicity of modes But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract 
the expenditure of human labour in general And just as in society a general or a banker plays a 
great  part  but  mere  man  on  the  other  hand  a  very  shabby  part  so  here  with  mere  human 
labour  It  is  the  expenditure  of  simple  labour  power  ie  of  the  labour  power  which  on  an 
average apart from any special development exists in the organism of every ordinary individual 
Simple average labour it is true varies in character in different countries and at different times 
but in a particular society it is given Skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified or 
rather as multiplied simple labour a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater 
quantity  of  simple  labour  Experience  shows  that  this  reduction  is  constantly  being  made  A 
commodity  may  be  the  product of the  most  skilled labour but its  value  by  equating  it to  the 
product of simple unskilled labour represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone The 
different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their 
standard are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers and 
consequently appear to be fixed by custom For simplicitys sake we shall henceforth account 
every kind of labour to be unskilled simple labour by this we do no more than save ourselves the 
trouble of making the reduction  
Just as therefore in viewing the coat and linen as values we abstract from their different use 
values so it is with the labour represented by those values we disregard the difference between 
its useful forms weaving and tailoring As the use values coat and linen are combinations of 
special productive activities with cloth and yarn while the values coat and linen are on the other 
hand mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour so the labour embodied in these 
latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn but only as being 
expenditure of human labour power Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation 
of  the  use  values  coat  and  linen  precisely  because these  two  kinds  of  labour  are  of  different 
qualities but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities only in so far as 
both  possess  the  same  quality  of  being  human  labour  do  tailoring  and  weaving  form  the 
substance of the values of the same articles  
Coats and linen however are not merely values but values of definite magnitude and according 
to  our  assumption  the  coat  is  worth  twice  as  much  as  the  ten  yards  of  linen  Whence  this 
difference in their values It is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour 
as the coat and consequently that in the production of the latter labour power must have been 
expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former  
While therefore with reference to use value the labour contained in a commodity counts only 
qualitatively with reference to value it counts only quantitatively and must first be reduced to 
human labour pure and simple In the former case it is a question of How and What in the latter 
of How much How long a time Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents 
only the quantity of labour embodied in it it follows that all commodities when taken in certain 
proportions must be equal in value  
If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a 
coat remains unchanged the sum of the values of the coats produced increases with their number 
If one coat represents x days labour two coats represent x days labour and so on But assume 
that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved 
In the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before in the second case two coats 

 

 

Chapter  
 
are  only  worth  as  much  as  one  was  before  although  in  both  cases  one  coat  renders  the  same 
service  as  before  and  the  useful  labour  embodied  in  it  remains  of  the  same  quality  But  the 
quantity of labour spent on its production has altered  
An increase in the quantity of use values is an increase of material wealth With two coats two 
men can be clothed with one coat only one man Nevertheless an increased quantity of material 
wealth  may  correspond  to  a  simultaneous  fall  in  the  magnitude  of  its  value  This  antagonistic 
movement has its origin in the twofold character of labour Productive power has reference of 
course  only  to  labour  of  some  useful  concrete  form  the  efficacy  of  any  special  productive 
activity  during  a  given  time  being  dependent  on  its  productiveness  Useful  labour  becomes 
therefore  a  more  or  less  abundant  source  of  products  in  proportion  to  the  rise  or  fall  of  its 
productiveness  On  the  other  hand  no  change  in  this  productiveness  affects  the  labour 
represented  by  value  Since  productive  power  is  an  attribute  of  the  concrete  useful  forms  of 
labour of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour so soon as we make abstraction 
from those concrete useful forms However then productive power may vary the same labour 
exercised during equal periods of time always yields equal amounts of value But it will yield 
during equal periods of time different quantities of values in use more if the productive power 
rise fewer if it fall The same change in productive power which increases the fruitfulness of 
labour and in consequence the quantity of use values produced by that labour will diminish the 
total value of this increased quantity of use values provided such change shorten the total labour 
time necessary for their production and vice vers  
On the one hand all labour is speaking physiologically an expenditure of human labour power 
and  in  its  character  of  identical  abstract  human  labour  it  creates  and  forms  the  value  of 
commodities On the other hand all labour is the expenditure of human labour power in a special 
form and with a definite aim and in this its character of concrete useful labour it produces use 
values 

Section  The Form of Value or ExchangeValue 

Commodities come  into  the  world in the shape  of  use  values  articles  or  goods  such  as  iron 
linen corn c This is their plain homely bodily form They are however commodities only 
because they are something twofold both objects of utility and at the same time depositories of 
value  They  manifest  themselves  therefore  as  commodities  or  have  the  form  of  commodities 
only in so far as they have two forms a physical or natural form and a value form  
The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly that we dont 
know where to have it The value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse materiality 
of their substance not an atom of matter enters into its composition Turn and examine a single 
commodity by itself as we will yet in so far as it remains an object of value it seems impossible 
to grasp it If however we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality 
and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one 
identical social substance viz human labour it follows as a matter of course that value can only 
manifest  itself  in  the  social  relation  of  commodity  to  commodity  In  fact  we  started  from 
exchange value or the exchange relation of commodities in order to get at the value that lies 
hidden behind it We must now return to this form under which value first appeared to us  
Every one knows if he knows nothing else that commodities have a value form common to them 
all and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use values I mean their 
money form Here however a task is set us the performance of which has never yet even been 
attempted  by  bourgeois  economy  the  task  of  tracing  the  genesis  of  this  money  form  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
developing  the  expression  of  value  implied  in  the  value  relation  of  commodities  from  its 
simplest almost imperceptible outline to the dazzling moneyform By doing this we shall at the 
same time solve the riddle presented by money  
The simplest valuerelation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a 
different kind Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the 
simplest expression of the value of a single commodity  

A Elementary or Accidental Form Of Value  

x commodity A  y commodity B or  
x commodity A is worth y commodity B  
 yards of linen   coat or  
 Yards of linen are worth  coat  

  The two poles of the expression of value Relative form and Equivalent 

form  

The  whole  mystery  of  the  form  of  value  lies  hidden  in  this  elementary  form  Its  analysis 
therefore is our real difficulty  
Here two different kinds of commodities in our example the linen and the coat evidently play 
two different parts The linen expresses its value in the coat the coat serves as the material in 
which that value is expressed The former plays an active the latter a passive part The value of 
the  linen  is  represented  as  relative  value  or  appears  in  relative  form  The  coat  officiates  as 
equivalent or appears in equivalent form  
The relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected mutually dependent and 
inseparable elements of the expression of value but at the same time are mutually exclusive 
antagonistic extremes  ie poles of the same expression They are allotted respectively to the 
two different commodities brought into relation by that expression It is not possible to express 
the value of linen in linen  yards of linen   yards of linen is no expression of value On the 
contrary such an equation merely says that  yards of linen are nothing else than  yards of 
linen a definite quantity of the use value linen The value of the linen can therefore be expressed 
only  relatively    ie  in  some  other  commodity  The  relative  form  of  the  value  of  the  linen 
presupposes therefore the presence of some other commodity  here the coat  under the form of 
an equivalent On the other hand the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same 
time assume the relative form That second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed 
Its  function  is  merely  to  serve  as  the  material  in  which  the  value  of  the  first  commodity  is 
expressed  
No doubt the expression  yards of linen   coat or  yards of linen are worth  coat implies 
the opposite relation  coat   yards of linen or  coat is worth  yards of linen But in that 
case I must reverse the equation in order to express the value of the coat relatively and so soon 
as I do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat A single commodity cannot 
therefore simultaneously assume in the same expression of value both forms The very polarity 
of these forms makes them mutually exclusive  
Whether then a commodity assumes the relative form or the opposite equivalent form depends 
entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of value  that is upon whether it is the 
commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed  
 The Relative Form of value  
a The nature and import of this form  

 

 

Chapter  
 
In order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the 
value relation of two commodities we must in the first place consider the latter entirely apart 
from  its  quantitative  aspect  The  usual  mode  of  procedure  is  generally  the  reverse  and  in  the 
value relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts 
of  commodities  that  are  considered  equal  to  each  other  It  is  apt  to  be  forgotten  that  the 
magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively only when those magnitudes are 
expressed in terms of the same unit It is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the 
same denomination and therefore commensurable 
Whether  yards of linen   coat or   coats or  x coats  that is whether a given quantity of 
linen  is  worth  few  or  many  coats  every  such  statement  implies  that  the  linen  and  coats  as 
magnitudes of value are expressions of the same unit things of the same kind Linen  coat is the 
basis of the equation  
But the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed do not play the same part It 
is  only  the  value  of  the  linen  that  is  expressed  And  how  By  its  reference  to  the  coat  as  its 
equivalent  as  something  that can be exchanged  for it  In  this relation  the  coat  is the  mode  of 
existence of value is value embodied for only as such is it the same as the linen On the other 
hand the linens own value comes to the front receives independent expression for it is only as 
being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value or exchangeable with the 
coat To borrow an illustration from chemistry butyric acid is a different substance from propyl 
formate Yet both are made up of the same chemical substances carbon C hydrogen H and 
oxygen O and that too in like proportions  namely CHO If now we equate butyric acid to 
propyl formate then in the first place propyl formate would be in this relation merely a form of 
existence of CHO and in the second place we should be stating that butyric acid also consists 
of CHO Therefore by thus equating the two substances expression would be given to their 
chemical composition while their different physical forms would be neglected  
If we say that as values commodities are mere congelations of human labour we reduce them by 
our analysis it is true to the abstraction value but we ascribe to this value no form apart from 
their bodily form It is otherwise in the value relation of one commodity to another Here the one 
stands forth in its character of value by reason of its relation to the other  
By making the coat the equivalent of the linen we equate the labour embodied in the former to 
that in the latter Now it is true that the tailoring which makes the coat is concrete labour of a 
different sort from the weaving which makes the linen But the act of equating it to the weaving 
reduces the tailoring to that which is really equal in the two kinds of labour to their common 
character of human labour In this roundabout way then the fact is expressed that weaving also 
in so far as it weaves value has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring and consequently is 
abstract human labour It is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities 
that  alone  brings into relief  the specific  character of valuecreating  labour  and this it  does  by 
actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities 
to their common quality of human labour in the abstract 
There is however something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the 
labour of which the value of the linen consists Human labour power in motion or human labour 
creates value but is not itself value It becomes value only in its congealed state when embodied 
in the form of some object In order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human 
labour  that  value  must  be  expressed  as  having  objective  existence  as  being  a  something 
materially different from the linen itself and yet a something common to the linen and all other 
commodities The problem is already solved  

 

 

Chapter  
 
When occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value the coat ranks qualitatively 
as the equal of the linen as something of the same kind because it is value In this position it is a 
thing in which we see nothing but value or whose palpable bodily form represents value Yet the 
coat itself the body of the commodity coat is a mere use value A coat as such no more tells us it 
is value than does the first piece of linen we take hold of This shows that when placed in value
relation to the linen the coat signifies more than when out of that relation just as many a man 
strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti  
In  the  production  of  the  coat  human  labour  power  in  the  shape  of  tailoring  must  have  been 
actually  expended  Human  labour  is  therefore  accumulated  in  it  In  this  aspect  the  coat  is  a 
depository of value but though worn to a thread it does not let this fact show through And as 
equivalent of the linen in the value equation it exists under this aspect alone counts therefore as 
embodied value as a body that is value A for instance cannot be your majesty to B unless at 
the same time majesty in Bs eyes assumes the bodily form of A and what is more with every 
new father of the people changes its features hair and many other things besides  
Hence in the value equation in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen the coat officiates as 
the  form  of  value  The  value  of  the  commodity  linen  is  expressed  by  the  bodily  form  of  the 
commodity  coat  the  value  of  one  by  the  use  value  of  the  other  As  a  use  value  the  linen  is 
something palpably different from the coat as value it is the same as the coat and now has the 
appearance of a coat Thus the linen acquires a value form different from its physical form The 
fact that it is value is made manifest by its equality with the coat just as the sheeps nature of a 
Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God  
We see then all that our analysis of the value of commodities has already told us is told us by 
the linen itself so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity the coat Only it 
betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar the language of commodities 
In order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour 
it says that the coat in so far as it is worth as much as the linen and therefore is value consists of 
the same labour as the linen In order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same 
as its buckram body it says that value has the appearance of a coat and consequently that so far 
as  the  linen  is  value  it  and  the  coat  are  as  like  as  two  peas  We  may  here  remark  that  the 
language  of  commodities  has  besides  Hebrew  many  other  more  or  less  correct  dialects  The 
German  Wertsein  to  be  worth  for  instance  expresses  in  a  less  striking  manner  than  the 
Romance verbs valere valer valoir that the equating of commodity B to commodity A is 
commodity As own mode of expressing its value Paris vaut bien une messe Paris is certainly 
worth a mass  
By  means  therefore  of  the  valuerelation  expressed  in  our  equation  the  bodily  form  of 
commodity B becomes the value form of commodity A or the body of commodity B acts as a 
mirror to the value of commodity A By putting itself in relation with commodity B as value in 
propri person as the matter of which human labour is made up the commodity A converts the 
value in use B into the substance in which to express its As own value The value of A thus 
expressed in the use value of B has taken the form of relative value  
b Quantitative determination of Relative value  
Every commodity whose value it is intended to express is a useful object of given quantity as  
bushels of corn or  lbs of coffee And a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite 
quantity of human labour The value form must therefore not only express value generally but 
also value in definite quantity Therefore in the value relation of commodity A to commodity B 
of the linen to the coat not only is the latter as value in general made the equal in quality of the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
linen but a definite quantity of coat  coat is made the equivalent of a definite quantity  
yards of linen  
The equation  yards of linen   coat or  yards of linen are worth one coat implies that the 
same  quantity  of  value  substance  congealed  labour  is  embodied  in  both  that  the  two 
commodities have each cost the same amount of labour of the same quantity of labour time But 
the  labour  time  necessary  for  the  production  of    yards  of  linen  or    coat  varies  with  every 
change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring We have now to consider the influence of 
such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value  

I Let the value of the linen vary that of the coat remaining constant If say in consequence 
of the exhaustion of flaxgrowing soil the labour time necessary for the production of the linen 
be doubled the value of the linen will also be doubled Instead of the equation  yards of linen 
  coat we should have  yards of linen   coats since  coat would now contain only half the 
labour  time  embodied  in    yards  of  linen  If  on  the  other  hand  in  consequence  say  of 
improved looms this labour time be reduced by onehalf the value of the linen would fall by 
onehalf  Consequently  we  should  have    yards  of  linen      coat  The  relative  value  of 
commodity A ie its value expressed in commodity B rises and falls directly as the value of A 
the value of B being supposed constant  

II Let the value of  the linen remain constant while the value of the coat varies If under 
these  circumstances  in  consequence  for  instance  of  a  poor  crop  of  wool  the  labour  time 
necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled we have instead of  yards of linen   
coat  yards of linen   coat If on the other hand the value of the coat sinks by onehalf then 
 yards of linen   coats Hence if the value of commodity A remain constant its relative value 
expressed in commodity B rises and falls inversely as the value of B  
If we compare the different cases in I and II we see that the same change of magnitude in relative 
value  may  arise  from  totally  opposite  causes  Thus  the  equation    yards  of  linen      coat 
becomes    yards  of  linen      coats  either  because  the  value  of  the  linen  has  doubled  or 
because the value of the coat has fallen by onehalf and it becomes  yards of linen   coat 
either because the value of the linen has fallen by onehalf or because the value of the coat has 
doubled  

III Let the quantities of labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and 
the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion In this case  
yards  of  linen  continue  equal  to    coat  however  much  their  values  may  have  altered  Their 
change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity whose value has 
remained constant If the values of all commodities rose or fell simultaneously and in the same 
proportion their relative values would remain unaltered Their real change of value would appear 
from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time  

IV The labour time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat and 
therefore the value of these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction but at 
unequal rates or in opposite directions or in other ways The effect of all these possible different 
variations on the relative value of a commodity may be deduced from the results of I II and III  
Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected 
in their relative expression that is in the equation expressing the magnitude of relative value The 
relative value of a commodity may vary although its value remains constant Its relative value 
may  remain  constant  although  its  value  varies  and  finally  simultaneous  variations  in  the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in 
amount 
 The Equivalent form of value 
We  have  seen  that  commodity  A  the  linen  by  expressing  its  value  in  the  use  value  of  a 
commodity differing in kind the coat at the same time impresses upon the latter a specific form 
of value namely that of the equivalent The commodity linen manifests its quality of having a 
value by the fact that the coat without having assumed a value form different from its bodily 
form is equated to the linen The fact that the latter therefore has a value is expressed by saying 
that the coat is directly exchangeable with it Therefore when we say that a commodity is in the 
equivalent form we express the fact that it is directly exchangeable with other commodities  
When one commodity such as a coat serves as the equivalent of another such as linen and coats 
consequently acquire the characteristic property of being directly exchangeable with linen we are 
far  from  knowing  in  what  proportion  the  two  are  exchangeable  The  value  of  the  linen  being 
given in magnitude that proportion depends on the value of the coat Whether the coat serves as 
the equivalent and the linen as relative value or the linen as the equivalent and the coat as relative 
value the magnitude of the coats value is determined independently of its value form by the 
labour time necessary for its production But whenever the coat assumes in the equation of value 
the  position  of  equivalent  its  value  acquires  no  quantitative  expression  on  the  contrary  the 
commodity coat now figures only as a definite quantity of some article  
For instance  yards of linen are worth  what  coats Because the commodity coat here plays 
the  part  of  equivalent  because  the  usevalue  coat  as  opposed  to  the  linen  figures  as  an 
embodiment of value therefore a definite number of coats suffices to express the definite quantity 
of value in the linen Two coats may therefore express the quantity of value of  yards of linen 
but they can never express the quantity of their own value A superficial observation of this fact 
namely that in the equation of value the equivalent figures exclusively as a simple quantity of 
some article of some use value has misled Bailey as also many others both before and after 
him into seeing in the expression of value merely a quantitative relation The truth being that 
when a commodity acts as equivalent no quantitative determination of its value is expressed  
The first peculiarity that strikes us in considering the form of the equivalent is this use value 
becomes the form of manifestation the phenomenal form of its opposite value  
The bodily form of the commodity becomes its value form But mark well that this quid pro quo 
exists in the case of any commodity B only when some other commodity A enters into a value 
relation with it and then only within the limits of this relation Since no commodity can stand in 
the relation of equivalent to itself and thus turn its own bodily shape into the expression of its 
own value every commodity is compelled to choose some other commodity for its equivalent 
and to accept the use value that is to say the bodily shape of that other commodity as the form of 
its own value  
One  of  the  measures that we  apply  to  commodities as  material  substances as use  values  will 
serve to illustrate this point A sugarloaf being a body is heavy and therefore has weight but we 
can neither see nor touch this weight We then take various pieces of iron whose weight has been 
determined beforehand The iron as iron is no more the form of manifestation of weight than is 
the sugarloaf Nevertheless in order to express the sugarloaf as so much weight we put it into a 
weightrelation with the iron In this relation the iron officiates as a body representing nothing 
but weight A certain quantity of iron therefore serves as the measure of the weight of the sugar 
and  represents  in  relation  to  the  sugarloaf  weight  embodied  the  form  of  manifestation  of 
weight This part is played by the iron only within this relation into which the sugar or any other 

 

 

Chapter  
 
body whose weight has to be determined enters with the iron Were they not both heavy they 
could not enter into this relation and the one could therefore not serve as the expression of the 
weight of the other When we throw both into the scales we see in reality that as weight they are 
both the same and that therefore when taken in proper proportions they have the same weight 
Just as the substance iron as a measure of weight represents in relation to the sugarloaf weight 
alone so in our expression of value the material object coat in relation to the linen represents 
value alone  
Here however the analogy ceases The iron in the expression of the weight of the sugarloaf 
represents a natural property common to both bodies namely their weight but the coat in the 
expression  of  value  of  the  linen  represents  a  nonnatural  property  of  both  something  purely 
social namely their value  
Since the relative form of value of a commodity  the linen for example  expresses the value of 
that commodity as being something wholly different from its substance and properties as being 
for instance coatlike we see that this expression itself indicates that some social relation lies at 
the bottom of it With the equivalent form it is just the contrary The very essence of this form is 
that the material commodity itself  the coat  just as it is expresses value and is endowed with 
the form of value by Nature itself Of course this holds good only so long as the value relation 
exists in which the coat stands in the position of equivalent to the linen Since however the 
properties of a thing are not the result of its relations to other things but only manifest themselves 
in such relations the coat seems to be endowed with its equivalent form its property of being 
directly exchangeable just as much by Nature as it is endowed with the property of being heavy 
or the capacity to keep us warm Hence the enigmatical character of the equivalent form which 
escapes the notice of the bourgeois political economist until this form completely developed 
confronts him in the shape of money He then seeks to explain away the mystical character of 
gold and silver by substituting for them less dazzling commodities and by reciting with ever 
renewed satisfaction the catalogue of all possible commodities which at one time or another have 
played the part of equivalent He has not the least suspicion that the most simple expression of 
value such as  yds of linen   coat already propounds the riddle of the equivalent form for 
our solution  
The body of the commodity that serves as the equivalent figures as the materialisation of human 
labour in the abstract and is at the same time the product of some specifically useful concrete 
labour  This  concrete  labour  becomes  therefore  the  medium  for  expressing  abstract  human 
labour If on the one hand the coat ranks as nothing but the embodiment of abstract human labour 
so on the other hand the tailoring which is actually embodied in it counts as nothing but the 
form  under  which  that  abstract  labour  is  realised  In  the  expression  of  value  of  the  linen  the 
utility of the tailoring consists not in making clothes but in making an object which we at once 
recognise to be Value and therefore to be a congelation of labour but of labour indistinguishable 
from that realised in the value of the linen In order to act as such a mirror of value the labour of 
tailoring must reflect nothing besides its own abstract quality of being human labour generally  
In tailoring as well as in weaving human labour power is expended Both therefore possess the 
general  property  of  being  human  labour  and  may  therefore  in  certain  cases  such  as  in  the 
production of value have to be considered under this aspect alone There is nothing mysterious in 
this But in the expression of value there is a complete turn of the tables For instance how is the 
fact to be expressed that weaving creates the value of the linen not by virtue of being weaving as 
such  but  by  reason  of  its  general  property  of  being  human  labour  Simply  by  opposing  to 
weaving that other particular form of concrete labour in this instance tailoring which produces 
the  equivalent  of  the  product  of  weaving  Just  as  the  coat  in  its  bodily  form  became  a  direct 

 

 

Chapter  
 
expression of value so now does tailoring a concrete form of labour appear as the direct and 
palpable embodiment of human labour generally  
Hence the second peculiarity of the equivalent form is that concrete labour becomes the form 
under which its opposite abstract human labour manifests itself  
But because this concrete labour tailoring in our case ranks as and is directly identified with 
undifferentiated  human  labour  it  also  ranks  as  identical  with  any  other  sort  of  labour  and 
therefore  with  that  embodied  in  the  linen  Consequently  although  like  all  other  commodity
producing labour it is the labour of private individuals yet at the same time it ranks as labour 
directly social in its character This is the reason why it results in a product directly exchangeable 
with other commodities We have then a third peculiarity of the equivalent form namely that the 
labour of private individuals takes the form of its opposite labour directly social in its form  
The two latter peculiarities of the equivalent form will become more intelligible if we go back to 
the  great  thinker  who  was  the  first  to  analyse  so  many  forms  whether  of  thought  society  or 
Nature and amongst them also the form of value I mean Aristotle  
In the first place he clearly enunciates that the money form of commodities is only the further 
development of the simple form of value  ie of the expression of the value of one commodity 
in some other commodity taken at random for he says  
 beds   house      

is not to be distinguished from  

 beds  so much money          

that  such  unlike 

impossible       

He further sees that the value relation which gives rise to this expression makes it necessary that 
the  house  should  qualitatively  be  made  the  equal  of  the  bed  and  that  without  such  an 
equalisation  these  two  clearly  different  things  could  not  be  compared  with  each  other  as 
commensurable  quantities  Exchange  he  says  cannot  take  place  without  equality  and 
equality  not  without  commensurability        Here  however 
he comes to a stop and gives up the further analysis of the form of value It is however in 
reality 
things  can  be 
commensurable  ie qualitatively equal Such an equalisation can only be something foreign to 
their real nature consequently only a makeshift for practical purposes  
Aristotle therefore himself tells us what barred the way to his further analysis it was the absence 
of any concept of value What is that equal something that common substance which admits of 
the  value  of  the  beds  being  expressed  by  a  house  Such  a  thing  in  truth  cannot  exist  says 
Aristotle And why not Compared with the beds the house does represent something equal to 
them in so far as it represents what is really equal both in the beds and the house And that is  
human labour  
There was however an important fact which prevented Aristotle from seeing that to attribute 
value  to  commodities  is  merely  a  mode  of  expressing  all  labour  as  equal  human  labour  and 
consequently  as  labour  of  equal  quality  Greek  society  was  founded  upon  slavery  and  had 
therefore for its natural basis the inequality of men and of their labour powers The secret of the 
expression of value namely that all kinds of labour are equal and equivalent because and so far 
as they are human labour in general cannot be deciphered until the notion of human equality has 
already acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice This however is possible only in a society in 
which  the  great  mass  of  the  produce  of  labour  takes  the  form  of  commodities  in  which 
consequently the dominant relation between man and man is that of owners of commodities The 
brilliancy of Aristotles genius is shown by this alone that he discovered in the expression of the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
value of commodities a relation of equality The peculiar conditions of the society in which he 
lived alone prevented him from discovering what in truth was at the bottom of this equality  
 The Elementary Form of value considered as a whole  
The elementary form of value of a commodity is contained in the equation expressing its value 
relation to another commodity of a different kind or in its exchange relation to the same The 
value  of  commodity  A  is  qualitatively  expressed  by  the  fact  that  commodity  B  is  directly 
exchangeable with it Its value is quantitatively expressed by the fact that a definite quantity of B 
is exchangeable with a definite quantity of A In other words the value of a commodity obtains 
independent  and  definite  expression  by  taking  the  form  of  exchange  value  When  at  the 
beginning of this chapter we said in common parlance that a commodity is both a use value and 
an exchange value we were accurately speaking wrong A commodity is a use value or object of 
utility and a value It manifests itself as this twofold thing that it is as soon as its value assumes 
an independent form  viz the form of exchange value It never assumes this form when isolated 
but only when placed in a value or exchange relation with another commodity of a different kind 
When  once  we  know  this  such  a  mode  of  expression  does  no  harm  it  simply  serves  as  an 
abbreviation  
Our analysis has shown that the form or expression of the value of a commodity originates in the 
nature of value and not that value and its magnitude originate in the mode of their expression as 
exchange  value  This  however  is  the  delusion  as  well  of  the  mercantilists  and  their  recent 
revivers  Ferrier  Ganilh  and  others as also  of  their antipodes the  modern  bagmen  of  Free
trade  such  as  Bastiat  The  mercantilists  lay  special  stress  on  the  qualitative  aspect  of  the 
expression of value and consequently on the equivalent form of commodities which attains its 
full perfection in money The modern hawkers of Freetrade who must get rid of their article at 
any price on the other hand lay most stress on the quantitative aspect of the relative form of 
value For them there consequently exists neither value nor magnitude of value anywhere except 
in its expression by means of the exchange relation of commodities that is in the daily list of 
prices current Macleod who has taken upon himself to dress up the confused ideas of Lombard 
Street in the most learned finery is a successful cross between the superstitious mercantilists and 
the enlightened Freetrade bagmen  
A  close scrutiny  of  the expression of  the  value  of  A  in  terms  of  B  contained in  the  equation 
expressing the value relation of A to B has shown us that within that relation the bodily form of 
A  figures only  as  a  use  value the  bodily  form  of  B  only  as  the  form  or  aspect  of  value The 
opposition  or  contrast  existing  internally  in  each  commodity  between  use  value  and  value  is 
therefore  made  evident  externally  by  two  commodities  being  placed  in  such  relation  to  each 
other  that  the  commodity  whose  value  it  is  sought  to  express  figures  directly  as  a  mere  use 
value  while  the  commodity  in  which  that  value  is  to  be  expressed  figures  directly  as  mere 
exchange value Hence the elementary form of value of a commodity is the elementary form in 
which the contrast contained in that commodity between use value and value becomes apparent  
Every product of labour is in all states of society a use value but it is only at a definite historical 
epoch in a societys development that such a product becomes a commodity viz at the epoch 
when  the  labour  spent  on  the  production  of  a  useful  article  becomes  expressed  as  one  of  the 
objective qualities of that article ie as its value It therefore follows that the elementary value 
form  is  also  the  primitive  form  under  which  a  product  of  labour  appears  historically  as  a 
commodity and that the gradual transformation of such products into commodities proceeds pari 
passu with the development of the value form  

 

 

Chapter  
 
We perceive at first sight the deficiencies of the elementary form of value it is a mere germ 
which must undergo a series of metamorphoses before it can ripen into the price form  
The  expression  of  the  value  of  commodity  A  in  terms  of  any  other  commodity  B  merely 
distinguishes the value from the use value of A and therefore places A merely in a relation of 
exchange with a single different commodity B but it is still far from expressing As qualitative 
equality and quantitative proportionality to all commodities To the elementary relative value 
form  of  a  commodity  there  corresponds  the  single  equivalent  form  of  one  other  commodity 
Thus in the relative expression of value of the linen the coat assumes the form of equivalent or 
of being directly exchangeable only in relation to a single commodity the linen  
Nevertheless  the  elementary  form  of  value  passes  by  an  easy  transition  into a  more  complete 
form  It  is  true  that  by  means  of  the  elementary  form  the  value  of  a  commodity  A  becomes 
expressed in terms of one and only one other commodity But that one may be a commodity of 
any kind coat iron corn or anything else Therefore according as A is placed in relation with 
one or the other we get for one and the same commodity different elementary expressions of 
value The number of such possible expressions is limited only by the number of the different 
kinds  of  commodities  distinct  from  it  The  isolated  expression  of  As  value  is  therefore 
convertible into a series prolonged to any length of the different elementary expressions of that 
value

 The Expanded Relative form of value  
The value of a single commodity the linen for example is now expressed in terms of numberless 
other elements of the world of commodities Every other commodity now becomes a mirror of the 
linens  value  It  is  thus  that  for  the  first  time  this  value  shows  itself  in  its  true  light  as  a 
congelation of undifferentiated human labour For the labour that creates it now stands expressly 
revealed as labour that ranks equally with every other sort of human labour no matter what its 
form whether tailoring ploughing mining c and no matter therefore whether it is realised in 
coats corn iron or gold The linen by virtue of the form of its value now stands in a social 
relation  no  longer  with  only  one  other  kind  of  commodity  but  with  the  whole  world  of 
commodities As a commodity it is a citizen of that world At the same time the interminable 
series  of  value  equations  implies  that  as  regards  the  value  of  a  commodity  it  is  a  matter  of 
indifference under what particular form or kind of use value it appears  
In the first form  yds of linen   coat it might for ought that otherwise appears be pure 
accident that these two commodities are exchangeable in definite quantities In the second form 
on the contrary we perceive at once the background that determines and is essentially different 
from this accidental appearance The value of the linen remains unaltered in magnitude whether 
expressed  in  coats  coffee  or  iron  or  in  numberless  different commodities  the  property  of  as 
many  different  owners  The  accidental  relation  between  two  individual  commodityowners 
disappears  It  becomes  plain  that  it  is  not  the  exchange  of  commodities  which  regulates  the 
magnitude  of  their  value  but  on  the  contrary  that  it  is  the  magnitude  of  their  value  which 
controls their exchange proportions  

 

 

Chapter  

 
 The particular Equivalent form 
Each commodity such as coat tea corn iron c figures in the expression of value of the linen 
as an equivalent and consequently as a thing that is value The bodily form of each of these 
commodities figures now as a particular equivalent form one out of many In the same way the 
manifold concrete useful kinds of labour embodied in these different commodities rank now as 
so many different forms of the realisation or manifestation of undifferentiated human labour  
 Defects of the Total or Expanded form of value 
In the first place the relative expression of value is incomplete because the series representing it 
is interminable The chain of which each equation of value is a link is liable at any moment to be 
lengthened by each new kind of commodity that comes into existence and furnishes the material 
for a fresh expression of value In the second place it is a manycoloured mosaic of disparate and 
independent expressions of value And lastly if as must be the case the relative value of each 
commodity in turn becomes expressed in this expanded form we get for each of them a relative 
value  form  different  in  every  case  and  consisting  of  an  interminable  series  of  expressions  of 
value  The  defects  of  the  expanded  relative  value  form  are  reflected  in  the  corresponding 
equivalent  form  Since  the  bodily  form  of  each  single  commodity  is  one  particular  equivalent 
form  amongst  numberless  others  we  have  on  the  whole  nothing  but  fragmentary  equivalent 
forms  each  excluding  the  others  In  the  same  way  also  the  special  concrete  useful  kind  of 
labour embodied in each particular equivalent is presented only as a particular kind of labour 
and therefore not as an exhaustive representative of human labour generally The latter indeed 
gains adequate manifestation in the totality of its manifold particular concrete forms But in that 
case its expression in an infinite series is ever incomplete and deficient in unity  
The  expanded  relative  value  form  is  however  nothing  but  the  sum  of  the  elementary  relative 
expressions or equations of the first kind such as  

 yards of linen   coat 
 yards of linen   lbs of tea etc  

Each of these implies the corresponding inverted equation  

 coat   yards of linen  
 lbs of tea   yards of linen etc  

In fact when a person exchanges his linen for many other commodities and thus expresses its 
value in a series of other commodities it necessarily follows that the various owners of the latter 
exchange them for the linen and consequently express the value of their various commodities in 
one and the same third commodity the linen If then we reverse the series  yards of linen   
coat or   lbs of tea etc that is to say if we give expression to the converse relation already 
implied in the series we get

 The altered character of the form of value  
All  commodities  now  express  their  value    in  an  elementary  form  because  in  a  single 
commodity    with  unity  because  in  one  and  the  same  commodity  This  form  of  value  is 
elementary and the same for all therefore general  
The forms A and B were fit only to express the value of a commodity as something distinct from 
its use value or material form  
The first form A furnishes such equations as the following   coat   yards of linen  lbs 
of tea   a ton of iron The value of the coat is equated to linen that of the tea to iron But to be 
equated to linen and again to iron is to be as different as are linen and iron This form it is plain 
occurs  practically  only  in  the  first  beginning  when  the  products  of  labour  are  converted  into 
commodities by accidental and occasional exchanges  
The  second  form  B  distinguishes  in  a  more  adequate  manner  than  the  first  the  value  of  a 
commodity  from  its  use  value  for  the  value  of  the  coat  is  there  placed  in  contrast  under  all 
possible shapes with the bodily form of the coat it is equated to linen to iron to tea in short to 
everything else only not to itself the coat On the other hand any general expression of value 
common to all is directly excluded for in the equation of value of each commodity all other 
commodities now appear only under the form of equivalents The expanded form of value comes 
into actual existence for the first time so soon as a particular product of labour such as cattle is 
no longer exceptionally but habitually exchanged for various other commodities  
The third and lastly developed form expresses the values of the whole world of commodities in 
terms of a single commodity set apart for the purpose namely the linen and thus represents to us 
their  values  by  means  of  their  equality  with  linen  The  value  of  every  commodity  is  now  by 
being  equated  to  linen  not  only  differentiated  from  its  own  use  value  but  from  all  other  use 
values generally and is by that very fact expressed as that which is common to all commodities 
By  this  form  commodities  are  for  the  first  time  effectively  brought  into  relation  with  one 
another as values or made to appear as exchange values  
The two earlier forms either express the value of each commodity in terms of a single commodity 
of a different kind or in a series of many such commodities In both cases it is so to say the 
special business of each single commodity to find an expression for its value and this it does 
without the help of the others These others with respect to the former play the passive parts of 
equivalents The general form of value C results from the joint action of the whole world of 
commodities and from that alone A commodity can acquire a general expression of its value 
only  by  all  other  commodities  simultaneously  with  it  expressing  their  values  in  the  same 
equivalent and every new commodity must follow suit It thus becomes evident that since the 
existence of commodities as values is purely social this social existence can be expressed by the 
totality of their social relations alone and consequently that the form of their value must be a 
socially recognised form  
All  commodities  being  equated  to  linen  now  appear  not  only  as  qualitatively  equal  as  values 
generally  but  also  as  values  whose  magnitudes  are capable  of  comparison  By  expressing  the 
magnitudes  of  their  values  in  one  and  the  same  material  the  linen  those  magnitudes  are  also 
compared with each other For instance  lbs of tea   yards of linen and  lbs of coffee  
 yards of linen Therefore  lbs of tea   lbs of coffee In other words there is contained in 
 lb of coffee only onefourth as much substance of value  labour  as is contained in  lb of tea  
The  general  form  of  relative  value  embracing  the  whole  world  of  commodities  converts  the 
single commodity that is excluded from the rest and made to play the part of equivalent  here 
the linen  into the universal equivalent The bodily form of the linen is now the form assumed in 

 

 

Chapter  
 
common by the values of all commodities it therefore becomes directly exchangeable with all 
and every of them The substance linen becomes the visible incarnation the social chrysalis state 
of  every  kind  of  human  labour  Weaving  which  is  the  labour  of  certain  private  individuals 
producing a particular article linen acquires in consequence a social character the character of 
equality with all other kinds of labour The innumerable equations of which the general form of 
value  is composed  equate  in  turn the  labour embodied  in the  linen  to  that  embodied in  every 
other  commodity  and  they  thus  convert  weaving  into  the  general  form  of  manifestation  of 
undifferentiated human labour In this manner the labour realised in the values of commodities is 
presented not only under its negative aspect under which abstraction is made from every concrete 
form  and  useful  property  of  actual  work  but  its  own  positive  nature  is  made  to  reveal  itself 
expressly The general value form is the reduction of all kinds of actual labour to their common 
character of being human labour generally of being the expenditure of human labour power  
The  general  value  form  which  represents  all  products  of  labour  as  mere  congelations  of 
undifferentiated human labour shows by its very structure that it is the social resum of the world 
of  commodities  That  form  consequently  makes  it  indisputably  evident  that  in  the  world  of 
commodities the character possessed by all labour of being human labour constitutes its specific 
social character  
 The Interdependent Development of the Relative Form of Value and of 

the Equivalent Form  

The degree of development of the relative form of value corresponds to that of the equivalent 
form  But  we  must  bear  in  mind  that  the  development of  the latter is  only the  expression and 
result of the development of the former  
The primary or isolated relative form of value of one commodity converts some other commodity 
into an isolated equivalent The expanded form of relative value which is the expression of the 
value of one commodity in terms of all other commodities endows those other commodities with 
the  character  of  particular  equivalents  differing  in  kind  And  lastly  a  particular  kind  of 
commodity acquires the character of universal equivalent because all other commodities make it 
the material in which they uniformly express their value  
The antagonism between the relative form of value and the equivalent form the two poles of the 
value form is developed concurrently with that form itself  
The first form  yds of linen  one coat already contains this antagonism without as yet fixing 
it According as we read this equation forwards or backwards the parts played by the linen and 
the coat are different In the one case the relative value of the linen is expressed in the coat in the 
other  case  the  relative  value  of  the  coat  is  expressed  in  the  linen  In  this  first  form  of  value 
therefore it is difficult to grasp the polar contrast  
Form B shows that only one single commodity at a time can completely expand its relative value 
and that it acquires this expanded form only because and in so far as all other commodities are 
with respect to it equivalents Here we cannot reverse the equation as we can the equation  yds 
of linen   coat without altering its general character and converting it from the expanded form 
of value into the general form of value  
Finally the form C gives to the world of commodities a general social relative form of value 
because and in so far as thereby all commodities with the exception of one are excluded from 
the  equivalent  form  A  single  commodity  the  linen  appears  therefore  to  have  acquired  the 
character of direct exchangeability with every other commodity because and in so far as this 
character is denied to every other commodity 

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  commodity  that  figures  as  universal  equivalent  is  on  the  other  hand  excluded  from  the 
relative value form If the linen or any other commodity serving as universal equivalent were at 
the same time to share in the relative form of value it would have to serve as its own equivalent 
We should then have  yds of linen   yds of linen this tautology expresses neither value nor 
magnitude of value In order to express the relative value of the universal equivalent we must 
rather reverse the form C This equivalent has no relative form of value in common with other 
commodities but its value is relatively expressed by a never ending series of other commodities 
Thus the expanded form of relative value or form B now shows itself as the specific form of 
relative value for the equivalent commodity  
 Transition from the General form of value to the Money form  
The universal equivalent form is a form of value in general It can therefore be assumed by any 
commodity  On  the  other  hand  if  a  commodity  be  found  to  have  assumed  the  universal 
equivalent form form C this is only because and in so far as it has been excluded from the rest 
of all other commodities as their equivalent and that by their own act And from the moment that 
this exclusion becomes finally restricted to one particular commodity from that moment only the 
general form of relative value of the world of commodities obtains real consistence and general 
social validity  
The particular commodity with whose bodily form the equivalent form is thus socially identified 
now becomes the money commodity or serves as money It becomes the special social function 
of  that  commodity  and  consequently  its  social  monopoly  to  play  within  the  world  of 
commodities the part of the universal equivalent Amongst the commodities which in form B 
figure  as  particular  equivalents  of the  linen  and in  form  C  express in  common  their  relative 
values in linen this foremost place has been attained by one in particular  namely gold If then 
in form C we replace the linen by gold we get  

D The MoneyForm 

  

      ounces of gold 

  yards of linen   
 
  coat 
 
  lbs of tea 
  lbs of coffee 
 
  quarter of corn   
  ounces of gold   
  a ton of iron 
 
x  Commodity A   
In passing from form A to form B and from the latter to form C the changes are fundamental On 
the other hand there is no difference between forms C and D except that in the latter gold has 
assumed the equivalent form in the place of linen Gold is in form D what linen was in form C  
the  universal  equivalent  The  progress  consists  in  this  alone  that  the  character  of  direct  and 
universal  exchangeability    in  other  words  that  the  universal  equivalent  form    has  now  by 
social custom become finally identified with the substance gold  
Gold is now money with reference to all other commodities only because it was previously with 
reference to them a simple commodity Like all other commodities it was also capable of serving 
as an equivalent either as simple equivalent in isolated exchanges or as particular equivalent by 
the side of others Gradually it began to serve within varying limits as universal equivalent So 
soon as it monopolises this position in the expression of value for the world of commodities it 

 

 

Chapter  
 
becomes the money commodity and then and not till then does form D become distinct from 
form C and the general form of value become changed into the money form  
The elementary expression of the relative value of a single commodity such as linen in terms of 
the commodity such as gold that plays the part of money is the price form of that commodity 
The price form of the linen is therefore  

 

 yards of linen   ounces of gold or if  ounces of gold when  

coined are   yards of linen   

The difficulty in forming  a concept of the money form consists in clearly comprehending the 
universal equivalent form and as a necessary corollary the general form of value form C The 
latter is deducible from form B the expanded form of value the essential component element of 
which we saw is form A  yards of linen   coat or x commodity A  y commodity B The 
simple commodity form is therefore the germ of the money form  

Section  The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret 

Thereof 

A commodity appears at first sight a very trivial thing and easily understood Its analysis shows 
that  it  is  in  reality  a  very  queer  thing  abounding  in  metaphysical  subtleties  and  theological 
niceties So far as it is a value in use there is nothing mysterious about it whether we consider it 
from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants or from the 
point that those properties are the product of human labour It is as clear as noonday that man 
by his industry changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature in such a way as to make 
them useful to him The form of wood for instance is altered by making a table out of it Yet 
for all that the table continues to be that common everyday thing wood But so soon as it steps 
forth as a commodity it is changed into something transcendent It not only stands with its feet on 
the ground but in relation to all other commodities it stands on its head and evolves out of its 
wooden brain grotesque ideas far more wonderful than tableturning ever was a 
The mystical character of commodities does not originate therefore in their use value Just as 
little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value For in the first place 
however varied the useful kinds of labour or productive activities may be it is a physiological 
fact that they are functions of the human organism and that each such function whatever may be 
its nature or form is essentially the expenditure of human brain nerves muscles c Secondly 
with  regard  to  that  which  forms  the  groundwork  for  the  quantitative  determination  of  value 
namely the duration of that expenditure or the quantity of labour it is quite clear that there is a 
palpable difference between its quantity and quality In all states of society the labour time that it 
costs to produce the means of subsistence must necessarily be an object of interest to mankind 
though not of equal interest in different stages of development And lastly from the moment 
that men in any way work for one another their labour assumes a social form  
Whence then arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour so soon as it assumes the 
form of commodities Clearly from this form itself The equality of all sorts of human labour is 
expressed objectively by their products all being equally values the measure of the expenditure 
of labour power by the duration of that expenditure takes the form of the quantity of value of the 
products  of  labour  and  finally  the  mutual  relations  of  the  producers  within  which  the  social 
character of their labour affirms itself take the form of a social relation between the products  
A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing simply because in it the social character of mens 
labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour because 
the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social 
 

 

Chapter  
 
relation existing not between themselves but between the products of their labour This is the 
reason why the products of labour become commodities social things whose qualities are at the 
same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses In the same way the light from an object 
is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve but as the objective form of 
something outside the eye itself But in the act of seeing there is at all events an actual passage 
of light from one thing to another from the external object to the eye There is a physical relation 
between physical things But it is different with commodities There the existence of the things 
qu commodities and the value relation between the products of labour which stamps them as 
commodities have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material 
relations arising therefrom There it is a definite social relation between men that assumes in 
their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between things In order therefore to find an analogy 
we must have recourse to the mistenveloped regions of the religious world In that world the 
productions of the human  brain appear as independent beings endowed with life and entering 
into relation both with one another and the human race So it is in the world of commodities with 
the products of mens hands This I call the Fetishism  which attaches itself to the products of 
labour so soon as they are produced as commodities and which is therefore inseparable from the 
production of commodities  
This Fetishism of commodities has its origin as the foregoing analysis has already shown in the 
peculiar social character of the labour that produces them  
As a general rule articles of utility become commodities only because they are products of the 
labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of 
each other The sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour 
of  society  Since  the  producers  do  not  come  into  social  contact  with  each  other  until  they 
exchange their products the specific social character of each producers labour does not show 
itself except in the act of exchange In other words the labour of the individual asserts itself as a 
part of the labour of society only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes 
directly between the products and indirectly through them between the producers To the latter 
therefore the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear not as 
direct social relations between individuals at work but as what they really are material relations 
between  persons  and  social  relations  between  things  It  is  only  by  being  exchanged  that  the 
products of labour acquire as values one uniform social status distinct from their varied forms 
of  existence  as  objects  of  utility  This  division  of  a  product  into  a  useful  thing  and  a  value 
becomes practically important only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful 
articles  are  produced  for  the  purpose  of  being  exchanged  and  their  character  as  values  has 
therefore to be taken into account beforehand during production From this moment the labour 
of the individual producer acquires socially a twofold character On the one hand it must as a 
definite useful kind of labour satisfy a definite social want and thus hold its place as part and 
parcel of the collective labour of all as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up 
spontaneously On the other hand it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer 
himself only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an 
established  social  fact  and  therefore  the  private  useful  labour  of  each  producer  ranks  on  an 
equality with that of all others The equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the 
result  only  of  an  abstraction  from  their  inequalities  or  of  reducing  them  to  their  common 
denominator viz expenditure of human labour power or human labour in the abstract The two
fold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him when reflected in his brain 
only  under  those  forms  which  are  impressed  upon  that  labour  in  everyday  practice  by  the 
exchange of products In this way the character that his own labour possesses of being socially 

 

 

Chapter  
 
useful takes the form of the condition that the product must be not only useful but useful for 
others  and  the  social  character  that  his  particular  labour  has  of  being  the  equal  of  all  other 
particular  kinds  of  labour  takes  the  form  that  all  the  physically  different  articles  that  are  the 
products of labour have one common quality viz that of having value  
Hence when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values it is not 
because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour Quite the 
contrary whenever by an exchange we equate as values our different products by that very act 
we also equate as human labour the different kinds of labour expended upon them We are not 
aware  of  this  nevertheless  we  do  it  Value  therefore  does  not  stalk  about  with  a  label 
describing what it is It is value rather that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic 
Later on we try to decipher the hieroglyphic to get behind the secret of our own social products 
for to stamp  an  object  of utility  as a  value  is just  as  much  a  social product  as  language  The 
recent scientific discovery that the products of labour so far as they are values are but material 
expressions of the human labour spent in their production marks indeed an epoch in the history 
of the development of the human race but by no means dissipates the mist through which the 
social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves 
The fact that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing viz the production 
of commodities the specific social character of private labour carried on independently consists 
in the equality of every kind of that labour by virtue of its being human labour which character 
therefore  assumes  in  the  product  the  form  of  value    this  fact  appears  to  the  producers 
notwithstanding the discovery above referred to to be just as real and final as the fact that after 
the discovery by science of the component gases of air the atmosphere itself remained unaltered  
What first of all practically concerns producers when they make an exchange is the question 
how much of some other product they get for their own in what proportions the products are 
exchangeable When these proportions have by custom attained a certain stability they appear 
to result from the nature of the products so that for instance one ton of iron and two ounces of 
gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of 
their  different  physical  and  chemical  qualities  appear  to  be  of  equal  weight  The  character  of 
having value when once impressed upon products obtains fixity only by reason of their acting 
and  reacting  upon  each  other  as  quantities  of  value  These  quantities  vary  continually 
independently of the will foresight and action of the producers To them their own social action 
takes the form of the action of objects which rule the producers instead of being ruled by them It 
requires  a  fully  developed  production  of  commodities  before  from  accumulated  experience 
alone the scientific conviction springs up that all the different kinds of private labour which are 
carried on independently of each other and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social 
division of labour are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society 
requires  them  And  why  Because  in  the  midst  of  all  the  accidental  and  ever  fluctuating 
exchange relations between the products the labour time socially necessary for their production 
forcibly asserts itself like an overriding law of Nature The law of gravity thus asserts itself when 
a  house falls about  our ears  The  determination of  the  magnitude  of  value  by  labour  time  is 
therefore a secret hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities 
Its discovery while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the 
magnitude of the values of products yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination 
takes place  
Mans  reflections  on  the  forms  of  social  life  and  consequently  also  his  scientific  analysis  of 
those  forms  take  a  course  directly  opposite  to  that  of  their  actual  historical  development  He 
begins post festum with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him The

characters  that  stamp  products  as  commodities  and  whose  establishment  is  a  necessary 
preliminary to the circulation of commodities have already acquired the stability of natural self
understood forms of social life before man seeks to decipher not their historical character for in 
his eyes they are immutable but their meaning Consequently it was the analysis of the prices of 
commodities  that  alone  led  to  the  determination  of  the  magnitude  of  value  and  it  was  the 
common  expression  of  all  commodities  in  money  that  alone  led  to  the  establishment  of  their 
characters as values It is however just this ultimate money form of the world of commodities 
that actually conceals instead of disclosing the social character of private labour and the social 
relations between the individual producers When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to 
linen  because  it  is  the  universal  incarnation  of  abstract  human  labour  the  absurdity  of  the 
statement  is  selfevident  Nevertheless  when  the  producers  of  coats  and  boots  compare  those 
articles with linen or what is the same thing with gold or silver as the universal equivalent they 
express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the 
same absurd form  
The  categories  of  bourgeois  economy  consist  of  such  like  forms  They  are  forms  of  thought 
expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite historically determined 
mode of production viz the production of commodities The whole mystery of commodities all 
the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of 
commodities vanishes therefore so soon as we come to other forms of production  
Since  Robinson  Crusoes  experiences  are  a  favourite  theme  with  political  economists  let  us 
take a look at him on his island Moderate though he be yet some few wants he has to satisfy and 
must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts such as making tools and furniture taming 
goats fishing and hunting Of his prayers and the like we take no account since they are a source 
of pleasure to him and he looks upon them as so much recreation In spite of the variety of his 
work  he  knows  that  his  labour  whatever  its  form  is  but  the  activity  of  one  and  the  same 
Robinson  and  consequently  that  it  consists  of  nothing  but  different  modes  of  human  labour 
Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work 
Whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another depends on the 
difficulties greater or less as the case may be to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed 
at This our friend Robinson soon learns by experience and having rescued a watch ledger and 
pen  and  ink  from  the  wreck  commences  like  a  trueborn  Briton to  keep  a  set  of  books  His 
stockbook contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him of the operations necessary 
for their production and lastly of the labour time that definite quantities of those objects have on 
an average cost him All the relations between Robinson and the objects that form this wealth of 
his own creation are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion even to Mr 
Sedley Taylor And yet those relations contain all that is essential to the determination of value  
Let us now transport ourselves from Robinsons island bathed in light to the European middle 
ages shrouded in darkness Here instead of the independent man we find everyone dependent 
serfs and lords vassals and suzerains laymen and clergy Personal dependence here characterises 
the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the 
basis of that production But for the very reason that personal dependence forms the groundwork 
of society there is no necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different 
from  their  reality  They  take  the  shape  in  the  transactions  of  society  of  services  in  kind  and 
payments in kind Here the particular and natural form of labour and not as in a society based on 
production  of  commodities  its  general  abstract  form  is  the  immediate  social  form  of  labour 
Compulsory  labour  is just  as  properly  measured  by time  as  commodityproducing  labour  but 
every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord is a definite quantity of his own

personal  labour  power  The  tithe  to  be  rendered  to  the  priest  is  more  matter  of  fact  than  his 
blessing No matter then what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people 
themselves in this society the social relations between individuals in the performance of their 
labour appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations and are not disguised under the 
shape of social relations between the products of labour  
For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour we have no occasion to go 
back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all 
civilised races We have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family that 
produces  corn  cattle  yarn  linen  and  clothing  for  home  use  These  different  articles  are  as 
regards  the  family  so  many  products  of  its  labour  but  as  between  themselves  they  are  not 
commodities The different kinds of labour such as tillage cattle tending spinning weaving and 
making  clothes  which result in  the  various  products  are in  themselves  and  such  as they  are 
direct social functions because functions of the family which just as much as a society based on 
the  production  of  commodities  possesses  a  spontaneously  developed  system  of  division  of 
labour The distribution of the work within the family and the regulation of the labour time of the 
several  members  depend  as  well  upon  differences  of  age  and  sex  as  upon  natural  conditions 
varying with the seasons The labour power of each individual by its very nature operates in this 
case  merely  as  a  definite  portion  of  the  whole  labour  power  of  the  family  and  therefore  the 
measure of the expenditure of individual labour power by its duration appears here by its very 
nature as a social character of their labour  
Let us now picture to ourselves by way of change a community of free individuals carrying on 
their  work  with  the  means  of  production  in  common  in  which  the  labour  power  of  all  the 
different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community All 
the characteristics of Robinsons labour are here repeated but with this difference that they are 
social instead of individual Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own 
personal  labour  and  therefore  simply  an  object  of  use  for  himself  The  total  product  of  our 
community  is  a  social  product  One  portion  serves  as  fresh  means  of  production  and  remains 
social But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence A distribution 
of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary The mode of this distribution will vary 
with  the  productive  organisation  of  the  community  and  the  degree  of  historical  development 
attained  by  the  producers  We  will  assume  but  merely  for  the  sake  of  a  parallel  with  the 
production of commodities that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence 
is  determined  by  his  labour  time  Labour  time  would  in  that  case  play  a  double  part  Its 
apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between 
the different  kinds  of  work  to  be  done  and the  various  wants  of  the community  On  the  other 
hand it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual 
and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption The social 
relations of the individual producers with regard both to their labour and to its products are in 
this case perfectly simple and intelligible and that with regard not only to production but also to 
distribution  
The  religious  world  is  but  the  reflex  of  the  real  world  And  for  a  society  based  upon  the 
production of commodities in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one 
another  by  treating  their  products  as  commodities  and  values  whereby  they  reduce  their 
individual  private  labour  to  the  standard  of  homogeneous  human  labour    for  such  a  society 
Christianity  with  its  cultus  of  abstract  man  more  especially  in  its  bourgeois  developments 
Protestantism Deism c is the most fitting form of religion In the ancient Asiatic and other 
ancient  modes  of  production  we  find  that  the  conversion  of  products  into  commodities  and 

 

 

Chapter  
 
therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities holds a subordinate place which 
however  increases  in  importance  as  the  primitive  communities  approach  nearer  and  nearer  to 
their  dissolution  Trading  nations  properly  so  called  exist  in  the  ancient  world  only  in  its 
interstices  like  the  gods  of  Epicurus  in  the  Intermundia  or  like  Jews  in  the  pores  of  Polish 
society Those ancient social organisms of production are as compared with bourgeois society 
extremely simple and transparent But they are founded either on the immature development of 
man individually who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen 
in a primitive tribal community or upon direct relations of subjection They can arise and exist 
only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage 
and when therefore the social relations within the sphere of material life between man and man 
and  between  man  and  Nature are  correspondingly  narrow This  narrowness  is reflected  in  the 
ancient worship of Nature and in the other elements of the popular religions The religious reflex 
of the real world can in any case only then finally vanish when the practical relations of every
day life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his 
fellowmen and to Nature  
The lifeprocess of society which is based on the process of material production does not strip 
off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men and is consciously 
regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan This however demands for society a certain 
material groundwork or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous 
product of a long and painful process of development  
Political  Economy  has  indeed  analysed  however incompletely  value  and  its magnitude and 
has  discovered  what  lies  beneath  these  forms  But  it  has  never  once  asked  the  question  why 
labour is represented by the value of its product and labour time by the magnitude of that value 
These formul which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a 
state of society in which the process of production has the mastery over man instead of being 
controlled by him such formul appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a selfevident 
necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself Hence forms of social production that 
preceded the bourgeois form are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the Fathers 
of the Church treated preChristian religions 
To what extent some economists are misled by the Fetishism inherent in commodities or by the 
objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour is shown amongst other ways by the 
dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange value Since 
exchange value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon an 
object Nature has no more to do with it than it has in fixing the course of exchange  
The  mode  of  production  in  which  the  product  takes  the  form  of  a  commodity  or  is  produced 
directly for exchange is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production It 
therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history though not in the same predominating 
and characteristic manner as nowadays Hence its Fetish character is comparatively easy to be 
seen  through  But  when  we  come  to  more  concrete  forms  even  this  appearance  of  simplicity 
vanishes Whence arose the illusions of the monetary system To it gold and silver when serving 
as money did not represent a social relation between producers but were natural objects with 
strange  social  properties  And  modern  economy  which  looks  down  with  such  disdain  on  the 
monetary system does not its superstition come out as clear as noonday whenever it treats of 
capital How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion that rents grow out of 
the soil and not out of society  
But  not  to  anticipate  we  will  content  ourselves  with  yet  another  example  relating  to  the 
commodity form Could commodities themselves speak they would say Our use value may be a 
 

Chapter  
 
thing  that  interests  men  It  is  no  part  of  us  as  objects  What  however  does  belong  to  us  as 
objects is our value Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it In the eyes of each other 
we are nothing but exchange values Now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth 
of the economist 

 

Value  ie exchange value is a property of things riches  ie use value 
of man Value in this sense necessarily implies exchanges riches do not  
Riches use value are the attribute of men value is the attribute of 
commodities A man or a community is rich a pearl or a diamond is valuable 
A pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or a diamond 

So  far  no  chemist  has  ever  discovered  exchange  value  either  in  a  pearl  or  a  diamond  The 
economic  discoverers  of  this  chemical  element  who  bythebye  lay  special  claim  to  critical 
acumen  find  however  that  the  use  value  of  objects  belongs  to  them  independently  of  their 
material properties while their value on the other hand forms a part of them as objects What 
confirms them in this view is the peculiar circumstance that the use value of objects is realised 
without exchange by means of a direct relation between the objects and man while on the other 
hand their value is realised only by exchange that is by means of a social process Who fails 
here to call to mind our good friend Dogberry who informs neighbour Seacoal that To be a 
wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but reading and writing comes by Nature

 The reader must note that we are not speaking here of the wages or value that the labourer gets for a 
given labour time but of the value of the commodity in which that labour time is materialised Wages 
is a category that as yet has no existence at the present stage of our investigation 
 In order to prove that labour alone is that allsufficient and real measure by which at all times the 
value  of  all  commodities  can  be  estimated  and  compared  Adam  Smith  says  Equal  quantities  of 
labour must at all times and in all places have the same value for the labourer In his normal state of 
health strength and activity and with the average degree of skill that he may possess he must always 
give up the same portion of his rest his freedom and his happiness Wealth of Nations b I ch 
V On the one hand Adam Smith here but not everywhere confuses the determination of value by 
means of the quantity of labour expended in the production of commodities with the determination of 
the values of commodities by means of the value of labour and seeks in consequence to prove that 
equal quantities of labour have always the same value On the other hand he has a presentiment that 
labour so far as it manifests itself in the value of commodities counts only as expenditure of labour 
power but he treats this expenditure as the mere sacrifice of rest freedom and happiness not as at the 
same time the normal activity of living beings But then he has the modern wagelabourer in his eye 
Much more aptly the anonymous predecessor of Adam Smith quoted above in note  this chapter 
says one man has employed himself a week in providing this necessary of life  and he that gives 
him some other in exchange cannot make a better estimate of what is a proper equivalent than by

qualitatively  is  Work  as  distinguished  from  Labour  that  which  creates  Value  and  counts 
quantitatively is Labour as distinguished from Work  Engels 
 The few economists amongst whom is S Bailey who have occupied themselves with the analysis 
of the form of value have been unable to arrive at any result first because they confuse the form of 
value  with  value  itself  and  second  because  under  the  coarse  influence  of  the  practical  bourgeois 
they  exclusively  give  their  attention  to  the  quantitative  aspect  of  the  question  The  command  of 
quantity  constitutes value Money and its Vicissitudes London  p  By S Bailey 
 The celebrated Franklin one of the first economists after Wm Petty who saw through the nature of 
value says Trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labour for labour the value of all 
things  is    most  justly  measured  by  labour  The  works  of  B  Franklin  c  edited  by  Sparks 
Boston  Vol II p  Franklin is unconscious that by estimating the value of everything in 
labour he makes abstraction from any difference in the sorts of labour exchanged and thus reduces 
them all to equal human labour But although ignorant of this yet he says it He speaks first of the 
one labour then of the other labour and finally of labour without further qualification as the 
substance of the value of everything 
 In a sort of way it is with man as with commodities Since he comes into the world neither with a 
looking glass in his hand nor as a Fichtian philosopher to whom I am I is sufficient man first sees 
and  recognises  himself  in  other  men  Peter  only  establishes  his  own  identity  as  a  man  by  first 
comparing himself with Paul as being of like kind And thereby Paul just as he stands in his Pauline 
personality becomes to Peter the type of the genus homo 
  Value  is  here  as  occasionally  in  the  preceding  pages  used  in  sense  of  value  determined  as  to 
quantity or of magnitude of value 
 This incongruity between the magnitude of value and its relative expression has with customary 
ingenuity been exploited by vulgar economists For example  Once admit that A falls because B 
with which it is exchanged rises while no less labour is bestowed in the meantime on A and your 
general  principle  of  value  falls  to  the  ground  If  he  Ricardo  allowed  that  when  A  rises  in  value 
relatively to B B falls in value relatively to A he cut away the ground on which he rested his grand 
proposition that the value of a commodity is ever determined by the labour embodied in it for if a 
change in the cost of A alters not only its own value in relation to B for which it is exchanged but 
also the value of B relatively to that of A though no change has taken place in the quantity of labour 
to produce B then not only the doctrine falls to the ground which asserts that the quantity of labour 
bestowed on an article regulates its value but also that which affirms the cost of an article to regulate 
its value J Broadhurst Political Economy London  pp  and  Mr Broadhurst might 
just as well say consider the fractions    c the number  remains unchanged 
and  yet  its  proportional  magnitude  its  magnitude  relatively  to  the  numbers        c 
continually diminishes Therefore the great principle that the magnitude of a whole number such as 
  is  regulated by  the  number  of  times  unity  is  contained  in  it  falls  to  the  ground  The  author

  Such  expressions  of  relations  in  general  called  by  Hegel  reflex  categories  form  a  very  curious 
class For instance one man is king only because other men stand in the relation of subjects to him 
They on the contrary imagine that they are subjects because he is king

 For this reason we can speak of the coat value of the linen when its value is expressed in coats or

in England fancied that by thus pointing out the various relative expressions of one and the same 
value he had proved the impossibility of any determination of the concept of value However narrow

 It is by no means selfevident that this character of direct and universal exchangeability is so to 
speak  a  polar  one  and  as  intimately  connected  with  its  opposite  pole  the  absence  of  direct 
exchangeability as the positive pole of the magnet is with its negative counterpart It may therefore be 
imagined that all commodities can simultaneously have this character impressed upon them just as it 
can be imagined that all Catholics can be popes together It is of course highly desirable in the eyes 
of  the  petit  bourgeois  for  whom  the  production  of  commodities  is  the  nec  plus  ultra  of  human

 The insufficiency of Ricardos analysis of the magnitude of value and his analysis is by far the best 
will appear from the rd and th books of this work As regards value in general it is the weak point 
of the classical school of Political Economy that it nowhere expressly and with full consciousness 
distinguishes between labour as it appears in the value of a product and the same labour as it appears 
in the use value of that product Of course the distinction is practically made since this school treats 
labour at one time under its quantitative aspect at another under its qualitative aspect But it has not 
the  least  idea  that  when  the  difference  between  various  kinds  of  labour  is  treated  as  purely 
quantitative their qualitative unity or equality and therefore their reduction to abstract human labour 
is implied For instance Ricardo declares that he agrees with Destutt de Tracy in this proposition As 
it  is  certain  that  our  physical  and  moral  faculties  are  alone  our  original  riches  the  employment  of 
those  faculties  labour  of  some  kind  is  our  only  original  treasure  and  it  is  always  from  this 
employment  that all those things are created which we call riches It  is certain too that all those 
things only represent the labour which has created them and if they have a value or even two distinct 
values  they  can  only  derive  them  from  that  the  value  of  the  labour  from  which  they  emanate 
Ricardo The Principles of Pol Econ  Ed Lond  p  We would here only point out 
that Ricardo puts his own  more profound interpretation upon the words of Destutt What the latter 
really says is that on the one hand all things which constitute wealth represent the labour that creates 
them but that on the other hand they acquire their two different values use value and exchange 
value from the value of labour He thus falls into the commonplace error of the vulgar economists 
who assume the value of one commodity in this case labour in order to determine the values of the 
rest But Ricardo reads him as if he had said that labour not the value of labour is embodied both in 
use value and exchange value Nevertheless Ricardo himself pays so little attention to the twofold 
character of the labour which has a twofold embodiment that he devotes the whole of his chapter on 
Value and Riches Their Distinctive Properties to a laborious examination of the trivialities of a JB 
Say And at the finish he is quite astonished to find that Destutt on the one hand agrees with him as to 
labour being the source of value and on the other hand with J B Say as to the notion of value 
  It  is  one  of  the  chief  failings  of  classical  economy  that  it  has  never  succeeded  by  means  of  its 
analysis of commodities and in particular of their value in discovering that form under which value 
becomes exchange value Even Adam Smith and Ricardo the best representatives of the school treat

the form of value as a thing of no importance as having no connection with the inherent nature of 
commodities  The  reason  for  this  is  not  solely  because  their  attention  is  entirely  absorbed  in  the 
analysis of the magnitude of value It lies deeper The value form of the product of labour is not only 
the most abstract but is also the most universal form taken by the product in bourgeois production 
and stamps that production as a particular species of social production and thereby gives it its special 
historical character If then we treat this mode of production as one eternally fixed by Nature for every 
state of society we necessarily overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value form and 
consequently of the commodity form and of its further developments money form capital form c 
We consequently find that economists who are thoroughly agreed as to labour time being the measure 
of the magnitude of value have the most strange and contradictory ideas of money the perfected form 
of  the  general  equivalent  This  is  seen  in  a  striking  manner  when  they  treat  of  banking  where  the 
commonplace  definitions  of  money  will  no  longer  hold  water  This  led  to  the  rise  of  a  restored 
mercantile  system  Ganilh  c  which  sees  in  value  nothing  but  a  social  form  or  rather  the 
unsubstantial ghost of that form Once for all I may here state that by classical Political Economy I 
understand  that  economy  which  since  the  time  of  W  Petty  has  investigated  the  real  relations  of 
production in bourgeois society in contradistinction to vulgar economy which deals with appearances 
only ruminates without ceasing on the materials long since provided by scientific economy and there 
seeks  plausible explanations  of  the  most  obtrusive  phenomena  for  bourgeois  daily  use  but  for  the 
rest confines itself to systematising in a pedantic way and proclaiming for everlasting truths the trite 
ideas held by the selfcomplacent bourgeoisie with regard to their own world to them the best of all 
possible worlds

p    Truly  comical  is  M  Bastiat  who  imagines  that  the  ancient  Greeks  and  Romans  lived  by 
plunder alone But when people plunder for centuries there must always be something at hand for 
them to seize the objects of plunder must be continually reproduced It would thus appear that even 
Greeks and Romans had some process of production consequently an economy which just as much 
constituted  the  material  basis  of  their  world  as  bourgeois  economy  constitutes  that  of  our  modern 
world Or perhaps Bastiat means that a mode of production based on slavery is based on a system of 
plunder  In  that  case  he  treads  on  dangerous  ground  If  a  giant  thinker  like  Aristotle  erred  in  his 
appreciation of slave labour why should a dwarf economist like Bastiat be right in his appreciation of 
wage labour I seize this opportunity of shortly answering an objection taken by a German paper in 
America to my work Zur Kritik der Pol Oekonomie  In the estimation of that paper my 
view that each special mode of production and the social relations corresponding to it in short that 
the economic structure of society is the real basis on which the juridical and political superstructure is 
raised  and  to  which  definite  social  forms  of  thought  correspond  that  the  mode  of  production 
determines the character of the social political and intellectual life generally all this is very true for

they gained a livelihood that explains why here politics and there Catholicism played the chief part

  The  author  of  Observations  and  S  Bailey  accuse  Ricardo  of  converting  exchange  value  from 
something relative into something absolute The opposite is the fact He has explained the apparent 
relation  between  objects  such  as  diamonds  and  pearls  in  which  relation  they  appear  as  exchange 
values and disclosed the true relation hidden behind the appearances namely their relation to each 
other  as  mere  expressions  of  human  labour  If  the  followers  of  Ricardo  answer  Bailey  somewhat 
rudely and by no means convincingly the reason is to be sought in this that they were unable to find 
in Ricardos own works any key to the hidden relations existing between value and its form exchange

Chapter  Exchange 

It is plain that commodities cannot go to market and make exchanges of their own account We 
must  therefore  have  recourse  to  their  guardians  who  are  also  their  owners Commodities are 
things and therefore without power of resistance against man If they are wanting in docility he 
can use force in other words he can take possession of them In order that these objects may 
enter  into  relation  with  each  other  as  commodities  their  guardians  must  place  themselves  in 
relation to one another as persons whose will resides in those objects and must behave in such a 
way that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other and part with his own except by 
means of an act done by mutual consent They must therefore mutually recognise in each other 
the rights of private proprietors This juridical relation which thus expresses itself in a contract 
whether such contract be part of a developed legal system or not is a relation between two wills 
and is but the reflex of the real economic relation between the two It is this economic relation 
that determines the subjectmatter comprised in each such juridical act 
The  persons  exist  for  one  another  merely  as  representatives  of  and  therefore  as  owners  of 
commodities In the course of our investigation we shall find in general that the characters who 
appear  on  the  economic  stage  are  but  the  personifications  of  the  economic  relations  that  exist 
between them  
What chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact that it looks upon every other 
commodity  as  but  the  form  of  appearance  of  its  own  value  A  born  leveller  and  a  cynic  it  is 
always ready to exchange not only soul but body with any and every other commodity be the 
same more repulsive than Maritornes herself The owner makes up for this lack in the commodity 
of a sense of the concrete by his own five and more senses His commodity possesses for himself 
no  immediate  usevalue  Otherwise  he  would  not  bring  it  to  the  market  It  has  usevalue  for 
others but for himself its only direct usevalue is that of being a depository of exchangevalue 
and consequently a means of exchange    Therefore he makes up his mind to part with it for 
commodities  whose  value in  use  is  of  service to  him  All commodities  are  nonusevalues  for 
their owners and usevalues for their nonowners Consequently they must all change hands But 
this change of hands is what constitutes their exchange and the latter puts them in relation with 
each other as values and realises them as values Hence commodities must be realised as values 
before they can be realised as usevalues  
On the other hand they must show that they are usevalues before they can be realised as values 
For the labour spent upon them counts effectively only in so far as it is spent in a form that is 
useful for others Whether that labour is useful for others and its product consequently capable of 
satisfying the wants of others can be proved only by the act of exchange  
Every  owner  of  a  commodity  wishes  to  part  with  it  in  exchange  only  for  those  commodities 
whose usevalue satisfies some want of his Looked at in this way exchange is for him simply a 
private transaction On the other hand he desires to realise the value of his commodity to convert 
it into any other suitable commodity of equal value irrespective of whether his own commodity 
has or has not any usevalue for the owner of the other From this point of view exchange is for 
him a social transaction of a general character But one and the same set of transactions cannot be 
simultaneously for all owners of commodities both exclusively private and exclusively social and 
general  
Let us look at the matter a little closer To the owner of a commodity every other commodity is 
in  regard  to  his  own  a  particular  equivalent  and  consequently  his  own  commodity  is  the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
universal equivalent for all the others But since this applies to every owner there is in fact no 
commodity  acting  as universal  equivalent and the relative  value of  commodities  possesses  no 
general form under which they can be equated as values and have the magnitude of their values 
compared So far therefore they do not confront each other as commodities but only as products 
or usevalues In their difficulties our commodity owners think like Faust Im Anfang war die 
Tat In the beginning was the deed  Goethe Faust They therefore acted and transacted 
before  they  thought  Instinctively  they  conform  to  the  laws  imposed  by  the  nature  of 
commodities  They  cannot  bring  their  commodities  into  relation  as  values  and  therefore  as 
commodities  except  by  comparing  them  with  some  one  other  commodity  as  the  universal 
equivalent That we saw from the analysis of a commodity But a particular commodity cannot 
become the universal equivalent except by a social act The social action therefore of all other 
commodities  sets  apart  the  particular  commodity  in  which  they  all  represent  their  values 
Thereby the bodily form of this commodity becomes the form of the socially recognised universal 
equivalent To be the universal equivalent becomes by this social process the specific function 
of  the  commodity  thus  excluded  by  the  rest  Thus  it  becomes    money  Illi  unum  consilium 
habent et virtutem et potestatem suam bestiae tradunt Et ne quis possit emere aut vendere nisi 
qui habet characterem aut nomen bestiae aut numerum nominis ejus These have one mind 
and shall give their power and strength unto the beast Revelations  And that no man 
might  buy  or  sell  save  he  that  had  the  mark  or  the  name  of  the  beast  or  the  number  of  his 
name Revelations  Apocalypse  
Money is a crystal formed of necessity in the course of the exchanges whereby different products 
of labour are practically equated to one another and thus by practice converted into commodities 
The historical progress and extension of exchanges develops the contrast latent in commodities 
between usevalue and value The necessity for giving an external expression to this contrast for 
the purposes of commercial intercourse urges on the establishment of an independent form of 
value and finds no rest until it is once for all satisfied by the differentiation of commodities into 
commodities and money At the same rate then as the conversion of products into commodities 
is being accomplished so also is the conversion of one special commodity into money  
The direct barter of products attains the elementary form of the relative expression of value in one 
respect but not in another That form is x Commodity A  y Commodity B The form of direct 
barter  is  x  usevalue  A    y  usevalue  B  The  articles  A  and  B  in  this  case  are  not  as  yet 
commodities but become so only by the act of barter The first step made by an object of utility 
towards  acquiring  exchangevalue  is  when  it  forms  a  nonusevalue  for  its  owner  and  that 
happens when it forms a superfluous portion of some article required for his immediate wants 
Objects in themselves are external to man and consequently alienable by him In order that this 
alienation may be reciprocal it is only necessary for men by a tacit understanding to treat each 
other as private owners of those alienable objects and by implication as independent individuals 
But  such  a  state  of  reciprocal  independence  has  no  existence  in  a  primitive  society  based  on 
property in common whether such a society takes the form of a patriarchal family an ancient 
Indian community or a Peruvian Inca State The exchange of commodities therefore first begins 
on the boundaries of such communities at their points of contact with other similar communities 
or with members of the latter So soon however as products once become commodities in the 
external relations of a community they also by reaction become so in its internal intercourse 
The proportions in which they are exchangeable are at first quite a matter of chance What makes 
them exchangeable is the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them Meantime the need for 
foreign objects of utility gradually establishes itself The constant repetition of exchange makes it 
a  normal  social  act  In  the  course  of  time  therefore  some  portion  at  least  of  the  products  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour  must  be  produced  with  a  special  view  to  exchange  From  that  moment  the  distinction 
becomes firmly established between the utility of an object for the purposes of consumption and 
its utility for the purposes of exchange Its usevalue becomes distinguished from its exchange
value  On  the  other  hand  the  quantitative  proportion  in  which  the  articles  are  exchangeable 
becomes  dependent  on  their  production  itself  Custom  stamps  them  as  values  with  definite 
magnitudes  
In the direct barter of products each commodity is directly a means of exchange to its owner and 
to all other persons an equivalent but that only in so far as it has usevalue for them At this 
stage therefore the articles exchanged do not acquire a valueform independent of their own use
value or of the individual needs of the exchangers The necessity for a valueform grows with the 
increasing  number  and  variety  of  the  commodities  exchanged  The  problem  and  the  means  of 
solution arise simultaneously Commodityowners never equate their own commodities to those 
of others and exchange them on a large scale without different kinds of commodities belonging 
to different owners being exchangeable for and equated as values to one and the same special 
article Such lastmentioned article by becoming the equivalent of various other commodities 
acquires at once though within narrow limits the character of a general social equivalent This 
character  comes  and  goes  with  the  momentary  social  acts  that  called  it  into  life  In  turns  and 
transiently it attaches itself first to this and then to that commodity But with the development of 
exchange it fixes itself firmly and exclusively to particular sorts of commodities and becomes 
crystallised by assuming the moneyform The particular kind of commodity to which it sticks is 
at first a matter of accident Nevertheless there are two circumstances whose influence is decisive 
The moneyform attaches itself either to the most important articles of exchange from outside 
and these in fact are primitive and natural forms in which the exchangevalue of home products 
finds expression or else it attaches itself to the object of utility that forms like cattle the chief 
portion  of  indigenous  alienable  wealth  Nomad  races  are  the  first  to  develop  the  moneyform 
because all their worldly goods consist of moveable objects and are therefore directly alienable 
and  because  their  mode  of  life  by  continually  bringing  them  into  contact  with  foreign 
communities solicits the exchange of products Man has often made man himself under the form 
of slaves serve as the primitive material of money but has never used land for that purpose Such 
an idea could only spring up in a bourgeois society already well developed It dates from the last 
third of the th century and the first attempt to put it in practice on a national scale was made a 
century afterwards during the French bourgeois revolution  
In proportion as exchange bursts its local bonds and the value of commodities more and more 
expands into an embodiment of human labour in the abstract in the same proportion the character 
of money attaches itself to commodities that are by Nature fitted to perform the social function of 
a universal equivalent Those commodities are the precious metals  
The truth of the proposition that although gold and silver are not by Nature money money is by 
Nature gold and silver is shown by the fitness of the physical properties of these metals for the 
functions  of  money  Up  to  this  point  however  we  are  acquainted  only  with  one  function  of 
money  namely  to  serve  as  the  form  of  manifestation  of  the  value  of  commodities  or  as  the 
material  in  which  the  magnitudes  of  their  values  are  socially  expressed  An  adequate  form  of 
manifestation of value a fit embodiment of abstract undifferentiated and therefore equal human 
labour that material alone can be whose every sample exhibits the same uniform qualities On the 
other  hand  since  the  difference  between  the  magnitudes  of  value  is  purely  quantitative  the 
money  commodity  must  be  susceptible  of  merely  quantitative  differences  must  therefore  be 
divisible at will and equally capable of being reunited Gold and silver possess these properties 
by Nature  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The usevalue of the moneycommodity becomes twofold In addition to its special usevalue as 
a  commodity  gold  for  instance  serving  to  stop  teeth  to  form  the  raw  material  of  articles  of 
luxury c it acquires a formal usevalue originating in its specific social function  
Since all commodities are merely particular equivalents of money the latter being their universal 
equivalent they with regard to the latter as the universal commodity play the parts of particular 
commodities   
We have seen that the moneyform is but the reflex thrown upon one single commodity of the 
value relations between all the rest That money is a commodity is therefore a new discovery 
only  for  those  who  when  they  analyse  it  start  from  its  fully  developed  shape  The  act  of 
exchange gives to the commodity converted into money not its value but its specific valueform 
By confounding these two distinct things some writers have been led to hold that the value of 
gold and silver is imaginary The fact that money can in certain functions be replaced by mere 
symbols  of  itself  gave  rise  to  that  other  mistaken  notion  that  it  is  itself  a  mere  symbol 
Nevertheless under this error lurked a presentiment that the moneyform of an object is not an 
inseparable  part  of  that  object  but  is  simply  the  form  under  which  certain  social  relations 
manifest themselves In this sense every commodity is a symbol since in so far as it is value it is 
only  the  material  envelope  of  the  human  labour  spent  upon  it  But  if  it  be  declared  that  the 
social characters  assumed  by  objects  or  the  material  forms  assumed  by  the social  qualities  of 
labour under the rgime of a definite mode of production are mere symbols it is in the same 
breath  also  declared  that  these  characteristics  are  arbitrary  fictions sanctioned by  the  socalled 
universal  consent  of  mankind  This  suited  the  mode  of  explanation  in  favour  during  the  th 
century  Unable  to  account  for  the  origin  of  the  puzzling  forms  assumed  by  social  relations 
between man and man people sought to denude them of their strange appearance by ascribing to 
them a conventional origin  
It has already been remarked above that the equivalent form of a commodity does not imply the 
determination of the magnitude of its value Therefore although we may be aware that gold is 
money  and  consequently  directly  exchangeable  for  all  other  commodities  yet  that  fact  by  no 
means tells how much  lbs for instance of gold is worth Money like every other commodity 
cannot express the magnitude of its value except relatively in other commodities This value is 
determined by the labourtime required for its production and is expressed by the quantity of any 
other commodity that costs the same amount of labourtime  Such quantitative determination of 
its relative value takes place at the source of its production by means of barter When it steps into 
circulation as money its value is already given  In the last decades of the th century it had 
already  been  shown  that  money  is  a  commodity  but  this  step  marks  only  the  infancy  of  the 
analysis The difficulty lies not in comprehending that money is a commodity but in discovering 
how why and by what means a commodity becomes money 
We  have  already  seen  from  the  most  elementary  expression  of  value  x  commodity  A    y 
commodity  B  that  the  object  in  which  the  magnitude  of  the  value  of  another  object  is 
represented  appears  to  have  the  equivalent  form  independently  of  this  relation  as  a  social 
property given to it by Nature We followed up this false appearance to its final establishment 
which is complete so soon as the universal equivalent form becomes identified with the bodily 
form  of  a  particular  commodity  and  thus  crystallised  into  the  moneyform  What  appears  to 
happen  is  not  that  gold  becomes  money  in  consequence  of  all  other  commodities  expressing 
their values in it but on the contrary that all other commodities universally express their values 
in gold because it is money The intermediate steps of the process vanish in the result and leave 
no trace behind Commodities find their own value already completely represented without any 
initiative on their part in another commodity existing in company with them These objects gold

behaviour of men in the social process of production is purely atomic Hence their relations to

 Proudhon begins by taking his ideal of Justice of justice ternelle from the juridical relations that 
correspond to the production of commodities thereby it may be noted he proves to the consolation 
of  all  good  citizens  that  the  production  of  commodities  is  a  form  of  production  as  everlasting  as 
justice Then he turns round and seeks to reform the actual production of commodities and the actual 
legal system corresponding thereto in accordance with this ideal What opinion should we have of a 
chemist who instead of studying the actual laws of the molecular changes in the composition and 
decomposition  of  matter  and  on  that  foundation  solving  definite  problems  claimed  to  regulate  the 
composition  and  decomposition  of  matter  by  means  of  the  eternal  ideas  of  naturalit  and 
affinit Do we really know any more about usury when we say it contradicts justice ternelle 
quit ternelle mutualit ternelle and other vrits ternelles than the fathers of the church 
did when they said it was incompatible with grce ternelle foi ternelle and la volont ternelle

 From this we may form an estimate of the shrewdness of the petitbourgeois socialism which while 
perpetuating the production of commodities aims at abolishing the antagonism between money and 
commodities and consequently since money exists only by virtue of this antagonism at abolishing 
money itself We might just as well try to retain Catholicism without the Pope For more on this point

Chapter  Money Or the Circulation of 

Commodities 

Section  The Measure of Values 

Throughout this work I assume for the sake of simplicity gold as the moneycommodity  
The first chief function of money is to supply commodities with the material for the expression of 
their values or to represent their values as magnitudes of the same denomination qualitatively 
equal and quantitatively comparable It thus serves as a universal measure of value And only by 
virtue of this function does gold the equivalent commodity par excellence become money  
It  is  not  money  that  renders  commodities  commensurable  Just  the  contrary  It  is  because  all 
commodities  as  values  are  realised  human  labour  and  therefore  commensurable  that  their 
values can be measured by one and the same special commodity and the latter be converted into 
the  common  measure  of  their  values  ie  into  money  Money  as  a  measure  of  value  is  the 
phenomenal form that must of necessity be assumed by that measure of value which is immanent 
in commodities labourtime 
The expression of the value of a commodity in gold  x commodity A  y moneycommodity  is 
its moneyform or price A single equation such as  ton of iron   ounces of gold now suffices 
to express the value of the iron in a socially valid manner There is no longer any need for this 
equation  to  figure  as  a  link  in  the  chain  of  equations  that  express  the  values  of  all  other 
commodities  because  the  equivalent  commodity  gold  now  has  the  character  of  money  The 
general form of relative value has resumed its original shape of simple or isolated relative value 
On the other hand the expanded expression of relative value the endless series of equations has 
now become the form peculiar to the relative value of the moneycommodity The series itself 
too is now given and has social recognition in the prices of actual commodities We have only to 
read  the  quotations  of  a  pricelist  backwards  to  find  the  magnitude  of  the  value  of  money 
expressed in all sorts of commodities But money itself has no price In order to put it on an equal 
footing with all other commodities in this respect we should be obliged to equate it to itself as its 
own equivalent  
The  price  or  moneyform  of  commodities  is  like  their  form  of  value  generally  a  form  quite 
distinct from their palpable bodily form it is therefore a purely ideal or mental form Although 
invisible the value of iron linen and corn has actual existence in these very articles it is ideally 
made perceptible by their equality with gold a relation that so to say exists only in their own 
heads Their owner must therefore lend them his tongue or hang a ticket on them before their 
prices  can  be  communicated  to  the  outside  world  Since  the  expression  of  the  value  of 
commodities in gold is a merely ideal act we may use for this purpose imaginary or ideal money 
Every  trader  knows  that  he  is  far  from  having  turned  his  goods  into  money  when  he  has 
expressed their value in a price or in imaginary money and that it does not require the least bit of 
real gold to estimate in that metal millions of pounds worth of goods When therefore money 
serves as a measure of value it is employed only as imaginary or ideal money This circumstance 
has given rise to the wildest theories But although the money that performs the functions of a 
measure of value is only ideal money price depends entirely upon the actual substance that is 
money The value or in other words the quantity of human labour contained in a ton of iron is 
expressed  in  imagination  by  such  a  quantity  of  the  moneycommodity  as  contains  the  same 
amount  of  labour  as  the  iron  According  therefore as  the  measure  of  value is  gold  silver  or 
 

 

Chapter  
 
copper  the  value  of  the  ton  of  iron  will  be  expressed  by  very  different  prices  or  will  be 
represented by very different quantities of those metals respectively  
If therefore two different commodities such as gold and silver are simultaneously measures of 
value all commodities have two prices  one a goldprice the other a silverprice These exist 
quietly side by side so long as the ratio of the value of silver to that of gold remains unchanged 
say at  Every change in their ratio disturbs the ratio which exists between the goldprices 
and the silverprices of commodities and thus proves by facts that a double standard of value is 
inconsistent with the functions of a standard  
Commodities with definite prices present themselves under the form a commodity A  x gold b 
commodity B  z gold c commodity C  y gold c where a b c represent definite quantities 
of  the  commodities  A  B  C  and  x  z  y  definite  quantities  of  gold  The  values  of  these 
commodities  are  therefore  changed  in  imagination  into  so  many  different  quantities  of  gold 
Hence  in  spite  of  the  confusing  variety  of  the  commodities  themselves  their  values  become 
magnitudes  of  the  same  denomination  goldmagnitudes  They  are  now  capable  of  being 
compared  with  each  other  and  measured  and  the  want  becomes  technically  felt  of  comparing 
them with some fixed quantity of gold as a unit measure This unit by subsequent division into 
aliquot parts becomes itself the standard or scale Before they become money gold silver and 
copper already possess such standard measures in their standards of weight so that for example 
a pound weight while serving as the unit is on the one hand divisible into ounces and on the 
other  may  be  combined  to  make  up  hundredweights  It  is  owing  to  this  that  in  all  metallic 
currencies the names given to the standards of money or of price were originally taken from the 
preexisting names of the standards of weight  
As  measure  of  Value  and  as  standard  of  price  money  has  two  entirely  distinct  functions  to 
perform It is the measure of value inasmuch as it is the socially recognised incarnation of human 
labour it is the standard of price inasmuch as it is a fixed weight of metal As the measure of 
value it serves to convert the values of all the manifold commodities into prices into imaginary 
quantities of gold as the standard of price it measures those quantities of gold The measure of 
values  measures  commodities  considered  as  values  the  standard  of  price  measures  on  the 
contrary quantities of gold by a unit quantity of gold not the value of one quantity of gold by the 
weight of another In order to make gold a standard of price a certain weight must be fixed upon 
as the unit In this case as in all cases of measuring quantities of the same denomination the 
establishment of an unvarying unit of measure is allimportant Hence the less the unit is subject 
to variation so much the better does the standard of price fulfil its office But only in so far as it 
is  itself  a  product  of  labour  and  therefore  potentially  variable  in  value  can  gold  serve  as  a 
measure of value  
It is in the first place quite clear that a change in the value of gold does not in any way affect its 
function  as  a  standard  of  price  No  matter  how  this  value  varies  the  proportions  between  the 
values of different quantities of the metal remain constant However great the fall in its value  
ounces of gold still have  times the value of  ounce and in prices the only thing considered is 
the relation between different quantities of gold Since on the other hand no rise or fall in the 
value of an ounce of gold can alter its weight no alteration can take place in the weight of its 
aliquot  parts  Thus  gold  always  renders  the  same  service  as  an  invariable  standard  of  price 
however much its value may vary  
In  the  second  place  a  change  in  the  value  of  gold  does  not  interfere  with  its  functions  as  a 
measure  of  value  The  change  affects  all  commodities  simultaneously  and  therefore  caeteris 
paribus leaves their relative values inter se unaltered although those values are now expressed 
in higher or lower goldprices  
 

 

Chapter  
 
Just as when we estimate the value of any commodity by a definite quantity of the usevalue of 
some other commodity so in estimating the value of the former in gold we assume nothing more 
than that the production of a given quantity of gold costs at the given period a given amount of 
labour As regards the fluctuations of prices generally they are subject to the laws of elementary 
relative value investigated in a former chapter  
A general rise in the prices of commodities can result only either from a rise in their values  the 
value  of  money  remaining  constant    or  from  a  fall  in  the  value  of  money  the  values  of 
commodities remaining constant On the other hand a general fall in prices can result only either 
from a fall in the values of commodities  the value of money remaining constant  or from a rise 
in the value of money the values of commodities remaining constant It therefore by no means 
follows that a rise in the value of money necessarily implies a proportional fall in the prices of 
commodities  or  that  a  fall  in  the  value  of  money  implies  a  proportional  rise  in  prices  Such 
change of price holds good only in the case of commodities whose value remains constant With 
those for example whose value rises simultaneously with and proportionally to that of money 
there is no alteration in price And if their value rise either slower or faster than that of money the 
fall or rise in their prices will be determined by the difference between the change in their value 
and that of money and so on  
Let us now go back to the consideration of the priceform  
By degrees there arises a discrepancy between the current moneynames of the various weights of 
the  precious  metal  figuring  as  money  and  the  actual  weights  which  those  names  originally 
represented This discrepancy is the result of historical causes among which the chief are   
The importation of foreign money into an imperfectly developed community This happened in 
Rome in its early days where gold and silver coins circulated at first as foreign commodities The 
names of these foreign coins never coincide with those of the indigenous weights  As wealth 
increases the less precious metal is thrust out by the more precious from its place as a measure of 
value  copper  by  silver  silver  by  gold  however  much  this  order  of  sequence  may  be  in 
contradiction  with  poetical  chronology  The  word  pound  for  instance  was  the  moneyname 
given to an actual pound weight of silver When gold replaced silver as a measure of value the 
same name was applied according to the ratio between the values of silver and gold to perhaps 
th of a pound of gold The word pound as a moneyname thus becomes differentiated from the 
same word as a weightname  The debasing of money carried on for centuries by kings and 
princes to such an extent that of the original weights of the coins nothing in fact remained but 
the names 
These historical causes convert the separation of the moneyname from the weightname into an 
established habit with the community Since the standard of money is on the one hand purely 
conventional and must on the other hand find general acceptance it is in the end regulated by 
law  A  given  weight  of  one  of  the  precious  metals  an  ounce  of  gold  for  instance  becomes 
officially  divided  into  aliquot  parts  with  legally  bestowed  names  such  as  pound  dollar  c 
These aliquot parts which thenceforth serve as units of money are then subdivided into other 
aliquot  parts  with  legal  names  such  as  shilling  penny  c  But  both  before  and  after  these 
divisions  are  made  a  definite  weight  of  metal  is  the  standard  of  metallic  money  The  sole 
alteration consists in the subdivision and denomination  
The prices or quantities of gold into which the values of commodities are ideally changed are 
therefore now expressed in the names of coins or in the legally valid names of the subdivisions of 
the gold standard Hence instead of saying A quarter of wheat is worth an ounce of gold we say 
it is worth  s  d In this way commodities express by their prices how much they are 

 

 

Chapter  
 
worth and money serves as money of account whenever it is a question of fixing the value of an 
article in its moneyform  
The name of a thing is something distinct from the qualities of that thing I know nothing of a 
man by knowing that his name is Jacob In the same way with regard to money every trace of a 
valuerelation disappears in the names pound dollar franc ducat c The confusion caused by 
attributing  a  hidden  meaning  to  these  cabalistic  signs  is  all  the  greater  because  these  money
names express both the values of commodities and at the same time aliquot parts of the weight 
of the metal that is the standard of money On the other hand it is absolutely necessary that 
value in order that it may be distinguished from the varied bodily forms of commodities should 
assume this material and unmeaning but at the same time purely social form  
Price  is  the  moneyname  of  the  labour  realised  in  a  commodity  Hence  the  expression  of  the 
equivalence of a commodity with the sum of money constituting its price is a tautology  just as 
in general the expression of the relative value of a commodity is a statement of the equivalence of 
two  commodities  But  although  price  being  the  exponent  of  the  magnitude  of  a  commoditys 
value is the exponent of its exchangeratio with money it does not follow that the exponent of 
this  exchangeratio  is  necessarily  the  exponent  of  the  magnitude  of  the  commoditys  value 
Suppose  two  equal  quantities  of  socially  necessary  labour  to  be  respectively  represented  by   
quarter of wheat and  nearly  oz of gold  is the expression in money of the magnitude 
of the value of the quarter of wheat or is its price If now circumstances allow of this price being 
raised to  or compel it to be reduced to  then although  and  may be too small or too 
great properly to express the magnitude of the wheats value nevertheless they are its prices for 
they are in the first place the form under which its value appears ie money and in the second 
place the exponents of its exchangeratio with money If the conditions of production in other 
words if the productive power of labour remain constant the same amount of social labourtime 
must both before and after the change in price be expended in the reproduction of a quarter of 
wheat This circumstance depends neither on the will of the wheat producer nor on that of the 
owners of other commodities  
Magnitude  of  value  expresses  a  relation  of  social  production  it  expresses  the  connexion  that 
necessarily  exists  between  a  certain  article  and  the  portion  of  the  total  labourtime  of  society 
required to produce it As soon as magnitude of value is converted into price the above necessary 
relation takes the shape of a more or less accidental exchangeratio between a single commodity 
and  another  the  moneycommodity  But  this  exchangeratio  may  express  either  the  real 
magnitude  of  that  commoditys  value  or  the  quantity  of  gold  deviating  from  that  value  for 
which  according  to  circumstances  it  may  be  parted  with  The  possibility  therefore  of 
quantitative  incongruity  between  price  and  magnitude  of  value  or  the  deviation  of  the  former 
from  the  latter  is  inherent  in  the  priceform  itself  This  is  no  defect  but  on  the  contrary 
admirably adapts the priceform to a mode of production whose inherent laws impose themselves 
only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities that compensate one another  
The priceform however is not only compatible with the possibility of a quantitative incongruity 
between magnitude of value and price ie between the former and its expression in money but it 
may also conceal a qualitative inconsistency so much so that although money is nothing but the 
valueform of commodities price ceases altogether to express value Objects that in themselves 
are no commodities such as conscience honour c are capable of being offered for sale by 
their  holders  and  of  thus  acquiring  through  their  price  the  form  of  commodities  Hence  an 
object may have a price without having value The price in that case is imaginary like certain 
quantities in mathematics On the other hand the imaginary priceform may sometimes conceal 

 

 

Chapter  
 
either a direct or indirect real valuerelation for instance the price of uncultivated land which is 
without value because no human labour has been incorporated in it  
Price like relative value in general expresses the value of a commodity eg a ton of iron by 
stating that a given quantity of the equivalent eg an ounce of gold is directly exchangeable for 
iron But it by no means states the converse that iron is directly exchangeable for gold In order 
therefore  that a  commodity  may  in  practice  act  effectively  as  exchangevalue  it  must  quit its 
bodily  shape  must  transform  itself  from  mere  imaginary  into  real  gold  although  to  the 
commodity  such  transubstantiation  may  be  more  difficult  than  to  the  Hegelian  concept  the 
transition  from  necessity  to  freedom  or  to  a  lobster  the  casting  of  his  shell  or  to  Saint 
Jerome the putting off of the old Adam Though a commodity may side by side with its actual 
form iron for instance take in our imagination the form of gold yet it cannot at one and the 
same  time  actually  be  both  iron  and  gold  To  fix  its  price  it  suffices  to  equate  it  to  gold  in 
imagination But to enable it to render to its owner the service of a universal equivalent it must 
be  actually  replaced  by  gold  If  the  owner  of  the  iron  were  to  go  to  the  owner  of  some  other 
commodity offered for exchange and were to refer him to the price of the iron as proof that it was 
already money he would get the same answer as St Peter gave in heaven to Dante when the 
latter recited the creed   

Assad bene e trascorsa  
Desta moneta gia la lega el peso  
Ma dimmi se tu lhai nella tua borsa  

A price therefore implies both that a commodity is exchangeable for money and also that it must 
be so exchanged On the other hand gold serves as an ideal measure of value only because it has 
already in the process of exchange established itself as the moneycommodity Under the ideal 
measure of values there lurks the hard cash  

Section  The Medium of Circulation 

A The Metamorphosis of Commodities 
We saw in a former chapter that the exchange of commodities implies contradictory and mutually 
exclusive conditions The differentiation of commodities into commodities and money does not 
sweep away these inconsistencies but develops a modus vivendi a form in which they can exist 
side by side This is generally the way in which real contradictions are reconciled For instance it 
is a contradiction to depict one body as constantly falling towards another and as at the same 
time constantly flying away from it The ellipse is a form of motion which while allowing this 
contradiction to go on at the same time reconciles it  
In so far as exchange is a process by which commodities are transferred from hands in which 
they are nonusevalues to hands in which they become usevalues it is a social circulation of 
matter  The  product  of  one  form  of  useful  labour  replaces  that  of  another  When  once  a 
commodity has found a restingplace where it can serve as a usevalue it falls out of the sphere 
of exchange into that of consumption But the former sphere alone interests us at present We 
have therefore now to consider exchange from a formal point of view to investigate the change 
of form or metamorphosis of commodities which effectuates the social circulation of matter  
The  comprehension  of  this  change  of  form  is  as  a  rule  very  imperfect  The  cause  of  this 
imperfection  is  apart  from  indistinct  notions  of  value  itself  that  every  change  of  form  in  a 
commodity  results  from  the  exchange  of  two  commodities  an  ordinary  one  and  the  money
commodity If we keep in view the material fact alone that a commodity has been exchanged for 
gold we overlook the very thing that we ought to observe  namely what has happened to the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
form of the commodity We overlook the facts that gold when a mere commodity is not money 
and that when other commodities express their prices in gold this gold is but the moneyform of 
those commodities themselves  
Commodities first of all enter into the process of exchange just as they are The process then 
differentiates  them  into  commodities  and  money  and  thus  produces  an  external  opposition 
corresponding to the internal opposition inherent in them as being at once usevalues and values 
Commodities as usevalues now stand opposed to money as exchangevalue On the other hand 
both opposing sides are commodities unities of usevalue and value But this unity of differences 
manifests itself at two opposite poles and at each pole in an opposite way Being poles they are 
as  necessarily  opposite  as  they  are  connected  On  the  one  side  of  the  equation  we  have  an 
ordinary  commodity  which  is  in  reality  a  usevalue  Its  value  is  expressed  only  ideally  in  its 
price by which it is equated to its opponent the gold as to the real embodiment of its value On 
the other hand the gold in its metallic reality ranks as the embodiment of value as money Gold 
as gold is exchangevalue itself As to its usevalue that has only an ideal existence represented 
by  the  series  of  expressions  of  relative  value  in  which  it  stands  face  to  face  with  all  other 
commodities  the  sum  of  whose  uses  makes  up  the  sum  of  the  various  uses  of  gold  These 
antagonistic  forms  of  commodities  are  the  real  forms  in  which  the  process  of  their  exchange 
moves and takes place  
Let us now accompany the owner of some commodity  say our old friend the weaver of linen  
to the scene of action the market His  yards of linen has a definite price  He exchanges it 
for the  and then like a man of the good old stamp that he is he parts with the  for a family 
Bible of the same price The linen which in his eyes is a mere commodity a depository of value 
he alienates in exchange for gold which is the linens valueform and this form he again parts 
with for another commodity the Bible which is destined to enter his house as an object of utility 
and  of  edification  to  its  inmates  The  exchange  becomes  an  accomplished  fact  by  two 
metamorphoses of opposite yet supplementary character  the conversion of the commodity into 
money  and  the  reconversion  of  the  money  into  a  commodity    The  two  phases  of  this 
metamorphosis are both of them distinct transactions of the weaver  selling or the exchange of 
the commodity for money buying or the exchange of the money for a commodity and the unity 
of the two acts selling in order to buy  
The  result  of  the  whole  transaction  as  regards  the  weaver  is  this  that  instead  of  being  in 
possession  of  the  linen  he  now  has  the  Bible  instead  of  his  original  commodity  he  now 
possesses another of the same value but of different utility In like manner he procures his other 
means  of  subsistence  and  means  of  production  From  his  point  of  view  the  whole  process 
effectuates nothing more than the exchange of the product of his labour for the product of some 
one elses nothing more than an exchange of products  
The exchange of commodities is therefore accompanied by the following changes in their form  

Commodity  Money  Commodity 

C M C 

The result of the whole process is so far as concerns the objects themselves C  C the exchange 
of one commodity for another the circulation of materialised social labour When this result is 
attained the process is at an end  
C  M First metamorphosis or sale 
The leap taken by value from the body of the commodity into the body of the gold is as I have 
elsewhere  called  it  the  salto  mortale  of  the  commodity  If  it  falls  short  then  although  the 
commodity itself is not harmed its owner decidedly is The social division of labour causes his 
 

 

Chapter  
 
labour  to  be  as  onesided  as  his  wants  are  manysided  This  is  precisely  the  reason  why  the 
product of his labour serves him solely as exchangevalue But it cannot acquire the properties of 
a socially recognised universal equivalent except by being converted into money That money 
however  is  in  some  one  elses  pocket  In  order  to  entice  the  money  out  of  that  pocket  our 
friends commodity must above all things be a usevalue to the owner of the money For this it 
is necessary that the labour expended upon it be of a kind that is socially useful of a kind that 
constitutes  a  branch  of  the  social  division  of  labour  But  division  of  labour  is  a  system  of 
production  which  has  grown  up  spontaneously  and  continues  to  grow  behind the  backs  of  the 
producers The commodity to be exchanged may possibly be the product of some new kind of 
labour  that  pretends  to  satisfy  newly  arisen  requirements  or  even  to  give  rise  itself  to  new 
requirements  A  particular  operation  though  yesterday  perhaps  forming  one  out  of  the  many 
operations conducted by one producer in creating a given commodity may today separate itself 
from  this  connexion  may  establish  itself  as  an  independent  branch  of  labour  and  send  its 
incomplete product to market as an independent commodity The circumstances may or may not 
be ripe for such a separation Today the product satisfies a social want Tomorrow the article 
may either altogether or partially be superseded by some other appropriate product Moreover 
although our weavers labour may be a recognised branch of the social division of labour yet that 
fact is by no means sufficient to guarantee the utility of his  yards of linen If the communitys 
want of linen and such a want has a limit like every other want should already be saturated by 
the products of rival weavers our friends product is superfluous redundant and consequently 
useless Although people do not look a gifthorse in the mouth our friend does not frequent the 
market for the purpose of making presents But suppose his product turn out a real usevalue and 
thereby attracts money The question arises how much will it attract No doubt the answer is 
already anticipated in the price of the article in the exponent of the magnitude of its value We 
leave out of consideration here any accidental miscalculation of value by our friend a mistake 
that  is  soon  rectified  in  the  market  We  suppose  him  to  have  spent  on  his  product  only  that 
amount  of  labourtime  that  is  on  an  average  socially  necessary  The  price  then  is  merely  the 
moneyname of the quantity of social labour realised in his commodity But without the leave 
and behind the back of our weaver the oldfashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change The 
labourtime that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of 
linen ceases to be so today a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from 
the prices quoted by our friends competitors Unluckily for him weavers are not few and far 
between Lastly suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labourtime 
than  is  socially  necessary  In  spite  of  this  all  these  pieces  taken  as  a  whole  may  have  had 
superfluous labourtime spent upon them If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the 
normal price of  shillings a yard this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the 
community  has  been  expended  in  the  form  of  weaving  The  effect  is  the  same  as  if  each 
individual  weaver  had  expended  more  labourtime  upon  his  particular  product  than  is  socially 
necessary Here we may say with the German proverb caught together hung together All the 
linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce of which each piece is only an aliquot 
part And as a matter of fact the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the 
same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour  
We see then commodities are in love with money  but the course of true love never did run 
smooth The quantitative division of labour is brought about in exactly the same spontaneous 
and accidental manner as its qualitative division The owners of commodities therefore find out 
that the same division of labour that turns them into independent private producers also frees the 
social process of production and the relations of the individual producers to each other within that 
process  from  all  dependence  on  the  will  of  those  producers  and  that  the  seeming  mutual 
 

 

Chapter  
 
independence of the individuals is supplemented by a system of general and mutual dependence 
through or by means of the products  
The  division  of  labour  converts  the  product  of  labour  into  a  commodity  and  thereby  makes 
necessary its further conversion into money At the same time it also makes the accomplishment 
of  this  transubstantiation  quite  accidental  Here  however  we  are  only  concerned  with  the 
phenomenon in its integrity and we therefore assume its progress to be normal Moreover if the 
conversion  take  place  at  all  that  is  if  the  commodity  be  not  absolutely  unsaleable  its 
metamorphosis does take place although the price realised may be abnormally above or below the 
value  
The seller has his commodity replaced by gold the buyer has his gold replaced by a commodity 
The fact which here stares us in the face is that a commodity and gold  yards of linen and  
have changed hands and places in other words that they have been exchanged But for what is 
the commodity exchanged For the shape assumed by its own value for the universal equivalent 
And for what is the gold exchanged For a particular form of its own usevalue Why does gold 
take  the  form  of  money  face  to  face  with  the  linen  Because  the  linens  price  of    its 
denomination  in  money  has  already  equated  the  linen  to  gold  in  its  character  of  money  A 
commodity strips off its original commodityform on being alienated ie on the instant its use
value actually attracts the gold that before existed only ideally in its price The realisation of a 
commoditys price or of its ideal valueform is therefore at the same time the realisation of the 
ideal  usevalue  of  money  the  conversion  of  a  commodity  into  money  is  the  simultaneous 
conversion of money into a commodity The apparently single process is in reality a double one 
From the pole of the commodityowner it is a sale from the opposite pole of the moneyowner it 
is a purchase In other words a sale is a purchase CM is also MC 
Up  to  this  point  we  have  considered  men  in  only  one  economic  capacity  that  of  owners  of 
commodities  a  capacity  in  which  they  appropriate  the  produce  of  the  labour  of  others  by 
alienating that of their own labour Hence for one commodityowner to meet with another who 
has money it is necessary either that the product of the labour of the latter person the buyer 
should  be  in  itself  money  should  be  gold  the  material  of  which  money  consists  or  that  his 
product should already have changed its skin and have stripped off its original form of a useful 
object In order that it may play the part of money gold must of course enter the market at some 
point or other This point is to be found at the source of production of the metal at which place 
gold is bartered as the immediate product of labour for some other product of equal value From 
that  moment  it  always  represents  the  realised  price  of  some  commodity    Apart  from  its 
exchange for other commodities at the source of its production gold in whosesoever hands it 
may be is the transformed shape of some commodity alienated by its owner it is the product of a 
sale or of the first metamorphosis CM Gold as we saw became ideal money or a measure of 
values in consequence of all commodities measuring their values by it and thus contrasting it 
ideally with their natural shape as useful objects and making it the shape of their value It became 
real  money  by  the  general  alienation  of  commodities  by  actually  changing  places  with  their 
natural  forms  as  useful  objects  and  thus  becoming  in  reality  the  embodiment  of  their  values 
When they assume this moneyshape commodities strip off every trace of their natural usevalue 
and  of  the  particular  kind  of  labour  to  which  they  owe  their  creation  in  order  to  transform 
themselves into the uniform socially recognised incarnation of homogeneous human labour We 
cannot tell from the mere look of a piece of money for what particular commodity it has been 
exchanged  Under  their  moneyform  all  commodities  look  alike  Hence  money  may  be  dirt 
although dirt is not money We will assume that the two gold pieces in consideration of which 
our weaver has parted with his linen are the metamorphosed shape of a quarter of wheat The 

 

 

Chapter  
 
sale of the linen CM is at the same time its purchase MC But the sale is the first act of a 
process that ends with a transaction of an opposite nature namely the purchase of a Bible the 
purchase of the linen on the other hand ends a movement that began with a transaction of an 
opposite nature namely with the sale of the wheat CM linenmoney which is the first phase 
of CMC linenmoneyBible is also MC moneylinen the last phase of another movement 
CMC  wheatmoneylinen  The  first  metamorphosis  of  one  commodity  its  transformation 
from a commodity into money is therefore also invariably the second metamorphosis of some 
other commodity the retransformation of the latter from money into a commodity 
MC or purchase  

The second and concluding metamorphosis of a commodity 

Because money is the metamorphosed shape of all other commodities the result of their general 
alienation for this reason it is alienable itself without restriction or condition It reads all prices 
backwards and thus so to say depicts itself in the bodies of all other commodities which offer 
to it the material for the realisation of its own usevalue At the same time the prices wooing 
glances cast at money by commodities define the limits of its convertibility by pointing to its 
quantity  Since  every  commodity  on  becoming  money  disappears  as  a  commodity  it  is 
impossible to tell from the money itself how it got into the hands of its possessor or what article 
has been changed into it Non olet from whatever source it may come Representing on the one 
hand a sold commodity it represents on the other a commodity to be bought  
MC  a  purchase  is  at  the  same  time  CM  a  sale  the  concluding  metamorphosis  of  one 
commodity  is  the  first  metamorphosis  of  another  With  regard  to  our  weaver  the  life  of  his 
commodity ends with the Bible into which he has reconverted his  But suppose the seller of 
the Bible turns the  set free by the weaver into brandy MC the concluding phase of CMC 
linenmoneyBible  is  also  CM  the  first  phase  of  CMC  Biblemoneybrandy  The 
producer of a particular commodity has that one article alone to offer this he sells very often in 
large quantities but his many and various wants compel him to split up the price realised the sum 
of money set free into numerous purchases Hence a sale leads to many purchases of various 
articles The concluding metamorphosis of a commodity thus constitutes an aggregation of first 
metamorphoses of various other commodities  
If we now consider the completed metamorphosis of a commodity as a whole it appears in the 
first place that it is made up of two opposite and complementary movements CM and MC 
These two antithetical transmutations of a commodity are brought about by two antithetical social 
acts on the part of the owner and these acts in their turn stamp the character of the economic 
parts played by him As the person who makes a sale he is a seller as the person who makes a 
purchase he is a buyer But just as upon every such transmutation of a commodity its two forms 
commodityform and moneyform exist simultaneously but at opposite poles so every seller has 
a  buyer  opposed  to  him  and  every  buyer  a  seller  While  one  particular  commodity  is  going 
through its two transmutations in succession from a commodity into money and from money into 
another  commodity  the  owner  of  the  commodity  changes  in  succession  his  part  from  that  of 
seller to that of buyer These characters of seller and buyer are therefore not permanent but attach 
themselves in turns to the various persons engaged in the circulation of commodities  
The complete metamorphosis of a commodity in its simplest form implies four extremes and 
three dramatic personae First a commodity comes face to face with money the latter is the form 
taken by the value of the former and exists in all its hard reality in the pocket of the buyer A 
commodityowner is thus brought into contact with a possessor of money So soon now as the 
commodity has been changed into money the money becomes its transient equivalentform the 
usevalue of which equivalentform is to be found in the bodies of other commodities Money the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
final term of the first transmutation is at the same time the startingpoint for the second The 
person who is a seller in the first transaction thus becomes a buyer in the second in which a third 
commodityowner appears on the scene as a seller 
The  two  phases  each  inverse  to  the  other  that  make  up  the  metamorphosis  of  a  commodity 
constitute together a circular movement a circuit commodityform stripping off of this form 
and return to the commodityform No doubt the commodity appears here under two different 
aspects At the startingpoint it is not a usevalue to its owner at the finishing point it is So too 
the  money  appears  in  the  first  phase  as  a  solid  crystal  of  value  a  crystal  into  which  the 
commodity eagerly solidifies and in the second dissolves into the mere transient equivalentform 
destined to be replaced by a usevalue  
The  two  metamorphoses  constituting  the  circuit  are  at  the  same  time  two  inverse  partial 
metamorphoses of two other commodities One and the same commodity the linen opens the 
series of its own metamorphoses and completes the metamorphosis of another the wheat In the 
first phase or sale the linen plays these two parts in its own person But then changed into gold 
it completes its own second and final metamorphosis and helps at the same time to accomplish 
the first metamorphosis of a third commodity Hence the circuit made by one commodity in the 
course of its metamorphoses is inextricably mixed up with the circuits of other commodities The 
total of all the different circuits constitutes the circulation of commodities  
The circulation of commodities differs from the direct exchange of products barter not only in 
form but in substance Only consider the course of events The weaver has as a matter of fact 
exchanged his linen for a Bible his own commodity for that of some one else But this is true 
only so far as he himself is concerned The seller of the Bible who prefers something to warm his 
inside no more thought of exchanging his Bible for linen than our weaver knew that wheat had 
been exchanged for his linen Bs commodity replaces that of A but A and B do not mutually 
exchange  those  commodities  It  may  of  course  happen  that  A  and  B  make  simultaneous 
purchases  the  one  from  the  other  but  such  exceptional  transactions  are  by  no  means  the 
necessary result of the general conditions of the circulation of commodities We see here on the 
one  hand  how  the  exchange  of  commodities  breaks  through  all  local  and  personal  bounds 
inseparable from direct barter and develops the circulation of the products of social labour and 
on  the  other  hand  how  it  develops  a  whole  network  of  social  relations  spontaneous  in  their 
growth and entirely beyond the control of the actors It is only because the farmer has sold his 
wheat that the weaver is enabled to sell his linen only because the weaver has sold his linen that 
our  Hotspur  is  enabled  to  sell  his  Bible  and  only  because  the  latter  has  sold  the  water  of 
everlasting life that the distiller is enabled to sell his eaudevie and so on  
The process of circulation therefore does not like direct barter of products become extinguished 
upon the usevalues changing places and hands The money does not vanish on dropping out of 
the circuit of the metamorphosis of a given commodity It is constantly being precipitated into 
new  places  in  the  arena  of  circulation  vacated  by  other  commodities  In  the  complete 
metamorphosis  of  the  linen  for  example  linen    money    Bible  the  linen  first  falls  out  of 
circulation  and  money  steps  into  its  place  Then  the  Bible  falls  out  of  circulation  and  again 
money  takes  its  place  When  one  commodity  replaces  another  the  moneycommodity  always 
sticks to the hands of some third person  Circulation sweats money from every pore  
Nothing can be more childish than the dogma that because every sale is a purchase and every 
purchase a sale therefore the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium of 
sales  and  purchases  If  this  means  that  the  number  of  actual  sales  is  equal  to  the  number  of 
purchases it is mere tautology But its real purport is to prove that every seller brings his buyer to 
market with him Nothing of the kind The sale and the purchase constitute one identical act an 
 

 

Chapter  
 
exchange between a commodityowner and an owner of money between two persons as opposed 
to each other as the two poles of a magnet They form two distinct acts of polar and opposite 
characters when performed by one single person Hence the identity of sale and purchase implies 
that the commodity is useless if on being thrown into the alchemistical retort of circulation it 
does not come out again in the shape of money if in other words it cannot be sold by its owner 
and  therefore  be  bought  by  the  owner  of  the  money  That  identity  further  implies  that  the 
exchange if it does take place constitutes a period of rest an interval long or short in the life of 
the commodity Since the first metamorphosis of a commodity is at once a sale and a purchase it 
is  also  an  independent  process  in  itself  The  purchaser  has  the  commodity  the  seller  has  the 
money ie a commodity ready to go into circulation at any time No one can sell unless some 
one  else  purchases  But  no  one  is  forthwith  bound  to  purchase  because  he  has  just  sold 
Circulation bursts through all restrictions as to time  place and individuals imposed by direct 
barter and this it effects by splitting up into the antithesis of a sale and a purchase the direct 
identity that in barter does exist between the alienation of ones own and the acquisition of some 
other  mans  product To  say  that  these  two independent  and  antithetical  acts have  an  intrinsic 
unity are essentially one is the same as to say that this intrinsic oneness expresses itself in an 
external antithesis If the interval in time between the two complementary phases of the complete 
metamorphosis of a commodity become too great if the split between the sale and the purchase 
become  too  pronounced the  intimate  connexion  between  them  their  oneness  asserts  itself  by 
producing  a crisis The antithesis usevalue and value the contradictions that private labour is 
bound to manifest itself as direct social labour that a particularised concrete kind of labour has to 
pass for abstract human labour the contradiction between the personification of objects and the 
representation of persons by things all these antitheses and contradictions which are immanent 
in commodities assert themselves and develop their modes of motion in the antithetical phases 
of the metamorphosis of a commodity These modes therefore imply the possibility and no more 
than the possibility of crises The conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of 
a long series of relations that from our present standpoint of simple circulation have as yet no 
existence  

B The currency  of money 

The  change  of  form  CMC  by  which  the  circulation  of  the  material  products  of  labour  is 
brought about requires that a given value in the shape of a commodity shall begin the process 
and shall also in the shape of a commodity end it The movement of the commodity is therefore 
a circuit On the other hand the form of this movement precludes a circuit from being made by 
the money The result is not the return of the money but its continued removal further and further 
away  from  its  startingpoint  So  long  as  the  seller  sticks  fast  to  his  money  which  is  the 
transformed  shape  of  his  commodity  that  commodity  is  still  in  the  first  phase  of  its 
metamorphosis and has completed only half its course But so soon as he completes the process 
so  soon  as  he  supplements  his  sale  by  a  purchase  the  money  again  leaves  the  hands  of  its 
possessor It is true that if the weaver after buying the Bible sell more linen money comes back 
into his hands But this return is not owing to the circulation of the first  yards of linen that 
circulation resulted in the money getting into the hands of the seller of the Bible The return of 
money  into  the  hands  of the  weaver is  brought  about  only  by  the renewal or repetition  of  the 
process of circulation with a fresh commodity which renewed process ends with the same result 
as  its  predecessor  did  Hence  the  movement  directly  imparted  to  money  by  the  circulation  of 
commodities takes the form of a constant motion away from its startingpoint of a course from 
the  hands  of  one  commodityowner  into  those  of  another  This  course  constitutes  its  currency 
cours de la monnaie  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  currency  of  money  is  the  constant  and  monotonous  repetition  of  the  same  process  The 
commodity is always in the hands of the seller the money as a means of purchase always in the 
hands  of  the  buyer  And  money  serves  as  a  means  of  purchase  by  realising  the  price  of  the 
commodity This realisation transfers the commodity from the seller to the buyer and removes the 
money from the hands of the buyer into those of the seller where it again goes through the same 
process with another commodity That this onesided character of the moneys motion arises out 
of the twosided character of the commoditys motion is a circumstance that is veiled over The 
very  nature  of  the  circulation  of  commodities  begets  the  opposite  appearance  The  first 
metamorphosis of a commodity is visibly not only the moneys movement but also that of the 
commodity itself in the second metamorphosis on the contrary the movement appears to us as 
the movement of the money alone In the first phase of its circulation the commodity changes 
place with the money Thereupon the commodity under its aspect of a useful object falls out of 
circulation into  consumption  In  its  stead  we  have  its  valueshape   the  money  It  then  goes 
through the second phase of its circulation not under its own natural shape but under the shape 
of money The continuity of the movement is therefore kept up by the money alone and the same 
movement that as regards the commodity consists of two processes of an antithetical character is 
when considered as the movement of the money always one and the same process a continued 
change of places with ever fresh commodities Hence the result brought about by the circulation 
of  commodities  namely  the  replacing  of  one  commodity  by  another  takes  the  appearance  of 
having been effected not by means of the change of form of the commodities but rather by the 
money  acting  as  a  medium  of  circulation  by  an  action  that  circulates  commodities  to  all 
appearance motionless in themselves and transfers them from hands in which they are nonuse
values to hands in which they are usevalues and that in a direction constantly opposed to the 
direction of the money The latter is continually withdrawing commodities from circulation and 
stepping  into  their  places  and  in  thus  way  continually  moving  further  and  further  from  its 
startingpoint  Hence  although  the  movement  of  the  money  is  merely  the  expression  of  the 
circulation of commodities yet the contrary appears to be the actual fact and the circulation of 
commodities seems to be the result of the movement of the money 
Again money functions as a means of circulation only because in it the values of commodities 
have independent reality Hence its movement as the medium of circulation is in fact merely 
the movement of commodities while changing their forms This fact must therefore make itself 
plainly  visible  in  the  currency  of  money  Thus  the  linen  for  instance  first  of  all  changes  its 
commodityform  into  its  moneyform  The  second  term  of  its  first  metamorphosis  CM  the 
money form then becomes the first term of its final metamorphosis MC its reconversion into 
the  Bible  But  each  of  these  two  changes  of  form  is  accomplished  by  an  exchange  between 
commodity and money by their reciprocal displacement The same pieces of coin come into the 
sellers hand as the alienated form of the commodity and leave it as the absolutely alienable form 
of the commodity They are displaced twice The first metamorphosis of the linen puts these coins 
into the weavers pocket the second draws them out of it The two inverse changes undergone by 
the same commodity are reflected in the displacement twice repeated but in opposite directions 
of the same pieces of coin  
If on the contrary only one phase of the metamorphosis is gone through if there are only sales or 
only purchases then a given piece of money changes its place only once Its second change of 
place  always  expresses  the  second  metamorphosis  of  the  commodity  its  reconversion  from 
money The frequent repetition of the displacement of the same coins reflects not only the series 
of  metamorphoses  that  a  single  commodity  has  gone  through  but  also  the  intertwining  of  the 
innumerable metamorphoses in the world of commodities in general It is a matter of course that 

 

 

Chapter  
 
all this is applicable to the simple circulation of commodities alone the only form that we are 
now considering  
Every commodity when it first steps into circulation and undergoes its first change of form does 
so only to fall out of circulation again and to be replaced by other commodities Money on the 
contrary  as the  medium  of  circulation  keeps continually  within the  sphere  of circulation  and 
moves  about  in  it  The  question  therefore  arises  how  much  money  this  sphere  constantly 
absorbs  
In  a  given  country  there  take  place  every  day  at  the  same  time  but  in  different  localities 
numerous  onesided  metamorphoses  of  commodities  or  in  other  words  numerous  sales  and 
numerous purchases The commodities are equated beforehand in imagination by their prices to 
definite  quantities  of  money  And  since  in  the  form  of  circulation  now  under  consideration 
money and commodities always come bodily face to face one at the positive pole of purchase 
the  other  at  the  negative  pole  of  sale  it  is  clear  that  the  amount  of  the  means  of  circulation 
required is determined beforehand by the sum of the prices of all these commodities As a matter 
of fact the money in reality represents the quantity or sum of gold ideally expressed beforehand 
by the sum of the prices of the commodities The equality of these two sums is therefore self
evident We know however that the values of commodities remaining constant their prices vary 
with  the  value  of  gold  the  material  of  money  rising  in  proportion  as  it  falls  and  falling  in 
proportion as it rises Now if in consequence of such a rise or fall in the value of gold the sum of 
the prices of commodities fall or rise the quantity of money in currency must fall or rise to the 
same  extent  The  change  in  the  quantity  of  the  circulating  medium  is  in  this  case  it  is  true 
caused by the money itself yet not in virtue of its function as a medium of circulation but of its 
function as a measure of value First the price of the commodities varies inversely as the value of 
the money and then the quantity of the medium of circulation varies directly as the price of the 
commodities Exactly the same thing would happen if for instance instead of the value of gold 
falling gold were replaced by silver as the measure of value or if instead of the value of silver 
rising gold were to thrust silver out from being the measure of value In the one case more silver 
would be current than gold was before in the other case less gold would be current than silver 
was before In each case the value of the material of money ie the value of the commodity that 
serves as the measure of value would have undergone a change and therefore so too would the 
prices of commodities which express their values in money and so too would the quantity of 
money current whose function it is to realise those prices We have already seen that the sphere 
of circulation has an opening through which gold or the material of money generally enters into 
it as a commodity with a given value Hence when money enters on its functions as a measure of 
value when it expresses prices its value is already determined If now its value fall this fact is 
first evidenced by a change in the prices of those commodities that are directly bartered for the 
precious  metals  at  the  sources  of  their  production  The  greater  part  of  all  other  commodities 
especially in the imperfectly developed stages of civil society will continue for a long time to be 
estimated by the former antiquated and illusory value of the measure of value Nevertheless one 
commodity infects another through their common valuerelation so that their prices expressed in 
gold  or  in  silver  gradually  settle  down  into  the  proportions  determined  by  their  comparative 
values until finally the values of all commodities are estimated in terms of the new value of the 
metal  that  constitutes  money  This  process  is  accompanied  by  the  continued  increase  in  the 
quantity of the precious metals an increase caused by their streaming in to replace the articles 
directly bartered for them at their sources of production In proportion therefore as commodities 
in general acquire their true prices in proportion as their values become estimated according to 
the fallen value of the precious metal in the same proportion the quantity of that metal necessary

for realising those new prices is provided beforehand A onesided observation of the results that 
followed upon the discovery of fresh supplies of gold and silver led some economists in the th 
and particularly in the th century to the false conclusion that the prices of commodities had 
gone  up  in  consequence  of  the  increased  quantity  of  gold  and  silver  serving  as  means  of 
circulation  Henceforth  we  shall  consider  the  value  of  gold  to  be  given  as  in  fact  it  is 
momentarily whenever we estimate the price of a commodity 
On this supposition then the quantity of the medium of circulation is determined by the sum of 
the prices that have to be realised If now we further suppose the price of each commodity to be 
given the sum of the prices clearly depends on the mass of commodities in circulation It requires 
but little racking of brains to comprehend that if one quarter of wheat costs  quarters will 
cost   quarters  and so on that consequently the quantity of money that changes 
place with the wheat when sold must increase with the quantity of that wheat  
If the mass of commodities remain constant the quantity of circulating money varies with the 
fluctuations in the prices of those commodities It increases and diminishes because the sum of 
the prices increases or diminishes in consequence of the change of price To produce this effect it 
is by no means requisite that the prices of all commodities should rise or fall simultaneously A 
rise or a fall in the prices of a number of leading articles is sufficient in the one case to increase 
in the other to diminish the sum of the prices of all commodities and therefore to put more or 
less  money  in  circulation  Whether  the  change  in  the  price  correspond  to  an  actual  change  of 
value in the commodities or whether it be the result of mere fluctuations in marketprices the 
effect  on  the  quantity  of  the  medium  of  circulation  remains  the  same  Suppose  the  following 
articles  to  be  sold  or  partially  metamorphosed  simultaneously  in  different  localities  say  one 
quarter of wheat  yards of linen one Bible and  gallons of brandy If the price of each article 
be  and the sum of the prices to be realised be consequently  it follows that  in money 
must go into circulation If on the other hand these same articles are links in the following chain 
of metamorphoses  quarter of wheat     yards of linen     Bible     gallons of 
brandy      a  chain  that  is  already  well  known  to  us  in  that  case  the    cause  the  different 
commodities  to  circulate  one  after  the  other  and  after  realising  their  prices  successively  and 
therefore the sum of those prices  they come to rest at last in the pocket of the distiller The  
thus make four moves This repeated change of place of the same pieces of money corresponds to 
the double change in form of the commodities to their motion in opposite directions through two 
stages  of  circulation  and  to  the  interlacing  of  the  metamorphoses  of  different  commodities 
These antithetic and complementary phases of which the process of metamorphosis consists are 
gone through not simultaneously but successively Time is therefore required for the completion 
of the series Hence the velocity of the currency of money is measured by the number of moves 
made by a given piece of money in a given time Suppose the circulation of the  articles takes a 
day The sum of the prices to be realised in the day is  the number of moves of the two pieces 
of money is four and the quantity of money circulating is  Hence for a given interval of time 
during  the  process  of  circulation  we  have  the  following  relation  the  quantity  of  money 
functioning  as  the  circulating  medium  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  prices  of  the  commodities 
divided  by  the  number  of  moves  made  by  coins  of  the  same  denomination  This  law  holds 
generally  
The total circulation of commodities in a given country during a given period is made up on the 
one hand of numerous isolated and simultaneous partial metamorphoses sales which are at the 
same time purchases in which each coin changes its place only once or makes only one move 
on the other hand of numerous distinct series of metamorphoses partly running side by side and 
partly coalescing with each other in each of which series each coin makes a number of moves 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the number being greater or less according to circumstances The total number of moves made by 
all the circulating coins of one denomination being given we can arrive at the average number of 
moves made by a single coin of that denomination or at the average velocity of the currency of 
money  The  quantity  of  money  thrown  into  the  circulation  at  the  beginning  of  each  day  is  of 
course determined by the sum of the prices of all the commodities circulating simultaneously side 
by side But once in circulation coins are so to say made responsible for one another If the one 
increase its velocity the other either retards its own or altogether falls out of circulation for the 
circulation can absorb only such a quantity of gold as when multiplied by the mean number of 
moves made by one single coin or element is equal to the sum of the prices to be realised Hence 
if the number of moves made by the separate pieces increase the total number of those pieces in 
circulation diminishes If the number of the moves diminish the total number of pieces increases 
Since the quantity of money capable of being absorbed by the circulation is given for a given 
mean velocity of currency all that is necessary in order to abstract a given number of sovereigns 
from the circulation is to throw the same number of onepound notes into it a trick well known to 
all bankers  
Just  as  the  currency  of  money  generally  considered  is  but  a  reflex  of  the  circulation  of 
commodities  or  of  the  antithetical  metamorphoses  they  undergo  so  too  the  velocity  of  that 
currency  reflects  the  rapidity  with  which  commodities  change  their  forms  the  continued 
interlacing of one series of metamorphoses with another the hurried social interchange of matter 
the  rapid  disappearance  of  commodities  from  the  sphere  of  circulation  and  the  equally  rapid 
substitution of fresh ones in their places Hence in the velocity of the currency we have the fluent 
unity  of  the  antithetical  and  complementary  phases  the  unity  of  the  conversion  of  the  useful 
aspect of commodities into their valueaspect and their reconversion from the latter aspect to the 
former or the unity of the two processes of sale and purchase On the other hand the retardation 
of  the  currency  reflects  the  separation  of  these  two  processes  into  isolated  antithetical  phases 
reflects the stagnation in the change of form and therefore in the social interchange of matter 
The circulation itself of course gives no clue to the origin of this stagnation it merely puts in 
evidence the phenomenon itself The general public who simultaneously with the retardation of 
the  currency  see  money  appear  and  disappear  less  frequently  at  the  periphery  of  circulation 
naturally attribute this retardation to a quantitative deficiency in the circulating medium  
The  total  quantity  of  money  functioning  during  a  given  period  as  the  circulating  medium  is 
determined on the one hand by the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities and on the 
other hand by the rapidity with which the antithetical phases of the metamorphoses follow one 
another On this rapidity depends what proportion of the sum of the prices can on the average be 
realised by each single coin But the sum of the prices of the circulating commodities depends on 
the quantity as well as on the prices of the commodities These three factors however state of 
prices  quantity  of  circulating  commodities  and  velocity  of  moneycurrency  are  all  variable 
Hence  the  sum  of  the  prices  to  be  realised  and  consequently  the  quantity  of  the  circulating 
medium depending on that sum will vary with the numerous variations of these three factors in 
combination Of these variations we shall consider those alone that have been the most important 
in the history of prices  
While prices remain constant the quantity of the circulating medium may increase owing to the 
number of circulating commodities increasing or to the velocity of currency decreasing or to a 
combination of the two On the other hand the quantity of the circulating medium may decrease 
with a decreasing number of commodities or with an increasing rapidity of their circulation  
With  a  general  rise  in  the  prices  of  commodities  the  quantity  of  the  circulating  medium  will 
remain constant provided the number of commodities in circulation decrease proportionally to 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the increase in their prices or provided the velocity of currency increase at the same rate as prices 
rise the number of commodities in circulation remaining constant The quantity of the circulating 
medium may decrease owing to the number of commodities decreasing more rapidly or to the 
velocity of currency increasing more rapidly than prices rise  
With  a  general  fall  in  the  prices  of  commodities  the  quantity  of  the  circulating  medium  will 
remain  constant  provided  the  number  of  commodities  increase  proportionally  to  their  fall  in 
price or provided the velocity of currency decrease in the same proportion The quantity of the 
circulating medium will increase provided the number of commodities increase quicker or the 
rapidity of circulation decrease quicker than the prices fall  
The  variations  of  the  different  factors  may  mutually  compensate  each  other  so  that 
notwithstanding their continued instability the sum of the prices to be realised and the quantity of 
money in circulation remain constant consequently we find especially if we take long periods 
into consideration that the deviations from the average level of the quantity of money current in 
any country are much smaller than we should at first sight expect apart of course from excessive 
perturbations periodically arising from industrial and commercial crises or less frequently from 
fluctuations in the value of money  
The law that the quantity of the circulating medium is determined by the sum of the prices of the 
commodities circulating and the average velocity of currency may also be stated as follows 
given the sum of the values of commodities and the average rapidity of their metamorphoses the 
quantity of precious metal current as money depends on the value of that precious metal The 
erroneous  opinion  that it  is  on  the  contrary  prices  that  are  determined  by  the  quantity  of  the 
circulating  medium  and  that  the  latter  depends  on  the  quantity  of  the  precious  metals  in  a 
country  this  opinion  was  based  by  those  who  first  held  it  on  the  absurd  hypothesis  that 
commodities  are  without  a  price  and  money  without  a  value  when  they  first  enter  into 
circulation  and  that  once  in  the  circulation  an  aliquot  part  of  the  medley  of  commodities  is 
exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious metals 

C Coin and symbols of value 

That  money  takes the shape  of  coin springs  from  its  function as the  circulating  medium  The 
weight of gold represented in imagination by the prices or moneynames of commodities must 
confront those commodities within the circulation in the shape of coins or pieces of gold of a 
given denomination Coining like the establishment of a standard of prices is the business of the 
State The different national uniforms worn at home by gold and silver as coins and doffed again 
in the market of the world indicate the separation between the internal or national spheres of the 
circulation of commodities and their universal sphere 
The only difference therefore between coin and bullion is one of shape and gold can at any 
time  pass  from  one  form  to  the  other  But  no  sooner  does  coin  leave  the  mint  than  it 
immediately finds itself on the highroad to the melting pot During their currency coins wear 
away some more others less Name and substance nominal weight and real weight begin their 
process of separation Coins of the same denomination become different in value because they 
are different in weight The weight of gold fixed upon as the standard of prices deviates from the 
weight that serves as the circulating medium and the latter thereby ceases any longer to be a real 
equivalent of the commodities whose prices it realises The history of coinage during the middle 
ages and down into the th century records the ever renewed confusion arising from this cause 
The natural tendency of circulation to convert coins into a mere semblance of what they profess 
to be into a symbol of the weight of metal they are officially supposed to contain is recognised 

 

 

Chapter  
 
by modern legislation which fixes the loss of weight sufficient to demonetise a gold coin or to 
make it no longer legal tender  
The fact that the currency of coins itself effects a separation between their nominal and their real 
weight creating a distinction between them as mere pieces of metal on the one hand and as coins 
with a definite function on the other  this fact implies the latent possibility of replacing metallic 
coins  by  tokens  of  some  other  material  by  symbols  serving  the  same  purposes  as  coins  The 
practical difficulties in the way of coining extremely minute quantities of gold or silver and the 
circumstance that at first the less precious metal is used as a measure of value instead of themore 
precious copper instead of silver silver instead of gold and that the less precious circulates as 
money until dethroned by the more precious  all these facts explain the parts historically played 
by silver and copper tokens as substitutes for gold coins Silver and copper tokens take the place 
of gold in those regions of the circulation where coins pass from hand to hand most rapidly and 
are subject to the maximum amount of wear and tear This occurs where sales and purchases on a 
very small scale are continually happening In order to prevent these satellites from establishing 
themselves permanently in the place of gold positive enactments determine the extent to which 
they must be compulsorily received as payment instead of gold The particular tracks pursued by 
the different species of coin in currency run naturally into each other The tokens keep company 
with gold to pay fractional parts of the smallest gold coin gold is on the one hand constantly 
pouring into retail circulation and on the other hand is as constantly being thrown out again by 
being changed into tokens 
The weight of metal in the silver and copper tokens is arbitrarily fixed by law When in currency 
they wear away even more rapidly than gold coins Hence their functions are totally independent 
of their weight and consequently of all value The function of gold as coin becomes completely 
independent of the metallic value of that gold Therefore things that are relatively without value 
such as paper notes can serve as coins in its place This purely symbolic character is to a certain 
extent  masked  in  metal  tokens  In  paper  money  it  stands  out  plainly  In  fact  ce  nest  que  le 
premier pas qui cote  
We allude here only to inconvertible paper money issued by the State and having compulsory 
circulation It has its immediate origin in the metallic currency Money based upon credit implies 
on  the  other  hand  conditions  which  from  our  standpoint  of  the  simple  circulation  of 
commodities are as yet totally unknown to us But we may affirm this much that just as true 
paper money takes its rise in the function of money as the circulating medium so money based 
upon credit takes root spontaneously in the function of money as the means of payment 
The State puts in circulation bits of paper on which their various denominations say   c 
are printed In so far as they actually take the place of gold to the same amount their movement is 
subject to the laws that regulate the currency of money itself A law peculiar to the circulation of 
paper money can spring up only from the proportion in which that paper money represents gold 
Such a law exists stated simply it is as follows the issue of paper money must not exceed in 
amount the gold or silver as the case may be which would actually circulate if not replaced by 
symbols Now the quantity of gold which the circulation can absorb constantly fluctuates about a 
given  level  Still  the  mass  of  the  circulating  medium  in  a  given  country  never  sinks  below  a 
certain  minimum  easily  ascertained  by  actual  experience  The  fact  that  this  minimum  mass 
continually  undergoes  changes  in  its  constituent  parts  or  that  the  pieces  of  gold  of  which  it 
consists  are  being  constantly  replaced  by  fresh  ones  causes  of  course  no  change  either  in  its 
amount or in the continuity of its circulation It can therefore be replaced by paper symbols If on 
the  other  hand  all  the  conduits  of  circulation  were  today  filled  with  paper  money  to  the  full 
extent  of  their  capacity  for  absorbing  money  they  might  tomorrow  be  overflowing  in 

 

 

Chapter  
 
consequence of a fluctuation in the circulation of commodities There would no longer be any 
standard If the paper money exceed its proper limit which is the amount in gold coins of the like 
denomination that can actually be current it would apart from the danger of falling into general 
disrepute  represent  only  that  quantity  of  gold  which  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  the 
circulation of commodities is required and is alone capable of being represented by paper If the 
quantity of paper money issued be double what it ought to be then as a matter of fact  would 
be the moneyname not of  of an ounce but of  of an ounce of gold The effect would be 
the same as if an alteration had taken place in the function of gold as a standard of prices Those 
values that were previously expressed by the price of  would now be expressed by the price of 
  
Paper money is a token representing gold or money The relation between it and the values of 
commodities is this that the latter are ideally expressed in the same quantities of gold that are 
symbolically represented by the paper Only in so far as paper money represents gold which like 
all other commodities has value is it a symbol of value 
Finally some one may ask why gold is capable of being replaced by tokens that have no value 
But  as  we  have  already  seen  it is  capable  of  being  so  replaced  only  in  so  far  as it functions 
exclusively as coin or as the circulating  medium and as nothing else Now money has other 
functions besides this one and the isolated function of serving as the mere circulating medium is 
not necessarily the only one attached to gold coin although this is the case with those abraded 
coins that continue to circulate Each piece of money is a mere coin or means of circulation only 
so long as it actually circulates But this is just the case with that minimum mass of gold which is 
capable of being replaced by paper money That mass remains constantly within the sphere of 
circulation continually functions as a circulating medium and exists exclusively for that purpose 
Its movement therefore represents nothing but the continued alternation of the inverse phases of 
the  metamorphosis  CMC  phases  in  which  commodities  confront  their  valueforms  only  to 
disappear again immediately The independent existence of the exchangevalue of a commodity is 
here a transient apparition by means of which the commodity is immediately replaced by another 
commodity Hence in this process which continually makes money pass from hand to hand the 
mere  symbolical  existence  of  money  suffices  Its  functional  existence  absorbs  so  to  say  its 
material existence Being a transient and objective reflex of the prices of commodities it serves 
only as a symbol of itself and is therefore capable of being replaced by a token One thing is 
however requisite this token must have an objective social validity of its own and this the paper 
symbol acquires by its forced currency This compulsory action of the State can take effect only 
within that inner sphere of circulation which is coterminous with the territories of the community 
but it is also only within that sphere that money completely responds to its function of being the 
circulating medium or becomes coin 

Section  Money 

The  commodity  that  functions  as  a  measure  of  value  and  either  in  its  own  person  or  by  a 
representative  as  the  medium  of  circulation is  money  Gold  or  silver  is therefore  money  It 
functions as money on the one hand when it has to be present in its own golden person It is then 
the moneycommodity neither merely ideal as in its function of a measure of value nor capable 
of being represented as in its function of circulating medium On the other hand it also functions 
as money when by  virtue of its function whether that function be performed in person or by 
representative  it  congeals into the sole  form  of  value  the  only  adequate  form  of  existence  of 
exchangevalue in opposition to usevalue represented by all other commodities  

 

 

 

A Hoarding 

Chapter  

The continual movement in circuits of the two antithetical metamorphoses of commodities or the 
never ceasing alternation of sale and purchase is reflected in the restless currency of money or in 
the function that money performs of a perpetuum mobile of circulation But so soon as the series 
of metamorphoses is interrupted so soon as sales are not supplemented by subsequent purchases 
money  ceases  to  be  mobilised  it  is  transformed  as  Boisguillebert  says  from  meuble  into 
immeuble from movable into immovable from coin into money  
With the very earliest development of the circulation of commodities there is also developed the 
necessity  and  the  passionate  desire  to  hold  fast  the  product  of  the  first  metamorphosis  This 
product is the transformed shape of the commodity or its goldchrysalis Commodities are thus 
sold not for the purpose of buying others but in order to replace their commodityform by their 
moneyform From being the mere means of effecting the circulation of commodities this change 
of form becomes the end and aim The changed form of the commodity is thus prevented from 
functioning  as  its  unconditionally  alienable  form  or  as  its  merely  transient  moneyform  The 
money becomes petrified into a hoard and the seller becomes a hoarder of money 
In the early stages of the circulation of commodities it is the surplus usevalues alone that are 
converted  into  money  Gold  and  silver  thus  become  of  themselves  social  expressions  for 
superfluity or wealth This naive form of hoarding becomes perpetuated in those communities in 
which the traditional mode of production is carried on for the supply of a fixed and limited circle 
of home wants It is thus with the people of Asia and particularly of the East Indies Vanderlint 
who fancies that the prices of commodities in a country are determined by the quantity of gold 
and silver to be found in it asks himself why Indian commodities are so cheap Answer Because 
the Hindus bury their money From  to  he remarks they buried  millions of pounds 
sterling of silver which originally came from America to Europe In the  years from  to 
 England exported to India and China  in silver which had been received in 
exchange for Australian gold Most of the silver exported to China makes its way to India  
As the production of commodities further develops every producer of commodities is compelled 
to  make  sure  of  the  nexus  rerum  or  the  social  pledge  His  wants  are  constantly  making 
themselves felt and necessitate the continual purchase of other peoples commodities while the 
production and sale of his own goods require time and depend upon circumstances In order then 
to be able to buy without selling he must have sold previously without buying This operation 
conducted on a general scale appears to imply a contradiction But the precious metals at the 
sources of their production are directly exchanged for other commodities And here we have sales 
by  the  owners  of  commodities  without  purchases  by  the  owners  of  gold  or  silver  And 
subsequent  sales  by  other  producers  unfollowed  by  purchases  merely  bring  about  the 
distribution of the newly produced precious metals among all the owners of commodities In this 
way all along the line of exchange hoards of gold and silver of varied extent are accumulated 
With  the  possibility  of  holding  and  storing  up  exchangevalue  in  the  shape  of  a  particular 
commodity arises also the greed for gold Along with the extension of circulation increases the 
power of money that absolutely social form of wealth ever ready for use Gold is a wonderful 
thing Whoever possesses it is lord of all he wants By means of gold one can even get souls into 
Paradise Columbus in his letter from Jamaica  Since gold does not disclose what has 
been  transformed  into  it  everything  commodity  or  not  is  convertible  into  gold  Everything 
becomes  saleable  and  buyable  The  circulation  becomes  the  great  social  retort  into  which 
everything is thrown to come out again as a goldcrystal Not even are the bones of saints and 
still less are more delicate res sacrosanctae extra commercium hominum able to withstand this 
alchemy  Just as every qualitative difference between commodities is extinguished in money 
 

 

Chapter  
 
so money on its side like the radical leveller that it is does away with all distinctionsa But 
money itself is a commodity an external object capable of becoming the private property of any 
individual  Thus  social  power  becomes  the  private  power  of  private  persons  The  ancients 
therefore denounced money as subversive of the economic and moral order of thingsb Modern 
society which soon after its birth pulled Plutus by the hair of his head from the bowels of the 
earth greets gold as its Holy Grail as the glittering incarnation of the very principle of its own 
life  
A commodity in its capacity of a usevalue satisfies a particular want and is a particular element 
of  material  wealth  But the  value  of  a commodity  measures the  degree  of  its  attraction for all 
other elements of material wealth and therefore measures the social wealth of its owner To a 
barbarian  owner  of  commodities  and  even  to  a  WestEuropean  peasant  value  is  the  same  as 
valueform and therefore to him the increase in his hoard of gold and silver is an increase in 
value It is true that the value of money varies at one time in consequence of a variation in its 
own value at another in consequence of a change in the values of commodities But this on the 
one hand does not prevent  ounces of gold from still containing more value than  ounces 
nor on the other hand does it hinder the actual metallic form of this article from continuing to be 
the universal equivalent form of all other commodities and the immediate social incarnation of 
all  human  labour  The  desire  after  hoarding  is  in  its  very  nature  unsatiable  In  its  qualitative 
aspect  or  formally  considered  money  has  no  bounds  to  its  efficacy  ie  it  is  the  universal 
representative  of  material  wealth  because  it  is  directly  convertible  into  any  other  commodity 
But at the same time every actual sum of money is limited in amount and therefore as a means 
of  purchasing  has  only  a  limited  efficacy  This  antagonism  between  the  quantitative  limits  of 
money and its qualitative boundlessness continually acts as a spur to the hoarder in his Sisyphus
like  labour  of  accumulating  It  is  with  him  as  it  is  with  a  conqueror  who  sees  in  every  new 
country annexed only a new boundary  
In order that gold may be held as money and made to form a hoard it must be prevented from 
circulating or from transforming itself into a means of enjoyment The hoarder therefore makes 
a  sacrifice  of  the  lusts  of  the  flesh  to  his  gold  fetish  He  acts  in  earnest  up  to  the  Gospel  of 
abstention On the other hand he can withdraw from circulation no more than what he has thrown 
into it in the shape of commodities The more he produces the more he is able to sell Hard work 
saving and avarice are therefore his three cardinal virtues and to sell much and buy little the 
sum of his political economy 
By the side of the gross form of a hoard we find also its aesthetic form in the possession of gold 
and  silver  articles  This  grows  with  the  wealth  of  civil  society  Soyons  riches  ou  paraissons 
riches Diderot  
In this way there is created on the one hand a constantly extending market for gold and silver 
unconnected with their functions as money and on the other hand a latent source of supply to 
which recourse is had principally in times of crisis and social disturbance  
Hoarding  serves  various  purposes in  the  economy  of  the  metallic  circulation  Its  first  function 
arises out of the conditions to which the currency of gold and silver coins is subject We have 
seen how along with the continual fluctuations in the extent and rapidity of the circulation of 
commodities and in their prices the quantity of money current unceasingly ebbs and flows This 
mass  must  therefore  be  capable  of  expansion  and  contraction  At  one  time  money  must  be 
attracted in order to act as circulating coin at another circulating coin must be repelled in order 
to act again as more or less stagnant money In order that the mass of money actually current 
may constantly saturate the absorbing power of the circulation it is necessary that the quantity of 
gold  and  silver  in  a  country  be  greater  than  the  quantity  required  to  function  as  coin  This 
 

Chapter  
 
condition is fulfilled by money taking the form of hoards These reserves serve as conduits for the 
supply or withdrawal of money to or from the circulation which in this way never overflows its 
banks  

 

B Means of Payment 

In the simple form of the circulation of commodities hitherto considered we found a given value 
always presented to us in a double shape as a commodity at one pole as money at the opposite 
pole The owners of commodities came therefore into contact as the respective representatives of 
what were already equivalents But with the development of circulation conditions arise under 
which  the  alienation  of  commodities  becomes  separated  by  an  interval  of  time  from  the 
realisation of their prices It will be sufficient to indicate the most simple of these conditions One 
sort of article requires a longer another a shorter time for its production Again the production of 
different commodities depends on different seasons of the year One sort of commodity may be 
born on its own market place another has to make a long journey to market Commodityowner 
No  may therefore be ready to sell before No  is ready to buy When the same transactions 
are  continually  repeated  between  the  same  persons  the  conditions  of  sale  are  regulated  in 
accordance with the conditions of production On the other hand the use of a given commodity 
of a house for instance is sold in common parlance let for a definite period Here it is only at 
the  end  of  the  term  that  the  buyer  has  actually  received  the  usevalue  of  the  commodity  He 
therefore buys it before he pays for it The vendor sells an existing commodity the purchaser 
buys  as  the  mere  representative  of  money  or  rather  of  future  money  The  vendor  becomes  a 
creditor  the  purchaser  becomes  a  debtor  Since  the  metamorphosis  of  commodities  or  the 
development of their valueform appears here under a new aspect money also acquires a fresh 
function it becomes the means of payment  
The character of creditor or of debtor results here from the simple circulation The change in the 
form of that circulation stamps buyer and seller with this new die At first therefore these new 
parts are just as transient and alternating as those of seller and buyer and are in turns played by 
the  same  actors  But  the  opposition  is  not  nearly  so  pleasant  and  is  far  more  capable  of 
crystallisation The same characters can however be assumed independently of the circulation 
of  commodities  The  classstruggles  of  the  ancient  world  took  the  form  chiefly  of  a  contest 
between debtors and creditors which in Rome ended in the ruin of the plebeian debtors They 
were displaced by slaves In the middle ages the contest ended with the ruin of the feudal debtors 
who  lost  their  political  power  together  with  the  economic  basis  on  which  it  was  established 
Nevertheless the money relation of debtor and creditor that existed at these two periods reflected 
only the deeperlying antagonism between the general economic conditions of existence of the 
classes in question  
Let  us  return  to  the  circulation  of  commodities  The  appearance  of  the  two  equivalents 
commodities and money at the two poles of the process of sale has ceased to be simultaneous 
The money functions now first as a measure of value in the determination of the price of the 
commodity sold the price fixed by the contract measures the obligation of the debtor or the sum 
of money that he has to pay at a fixed date Secondly it serves as an ideal means of purchase 
Although existing only in the promise of the buyer to pay it causes the commodity to change 
hands It is not before the day fixed for payment that the means of payment actually steps into 
circulation  leaves  the  hand  of  the  buyer  for  that  of  the  seller  The  circulating  medium  was 
transformed  into  a  hoard  because  the  process  stopped  short  after  the  first  phase  because  the 
converted shape of the commodity viz the money was withdrawn from circulation The means 
of  payment  enters  the  circulation  but  only  after  the  commodity  has  left  it  The  money  is  no 
longer the means that brings about the process It only brings it to a close by stepping in as the

absolute form of existence of exchangevalue or as the universal commodity The seller turned 
his commodity into money in order thereby to satisfy some want the hoarder did the same in 
order to keep his commodity in its moneyshape and the debtor in order to be able to pay if he 
do  not  pay  his  goods  will  be  sold  by  the  sheriff  The  valueform  of  commodities  money  is 
therefore now the end and aim of a sale and that owing to a social necessity springing out of the 
process of circulation itself  
The buyer converts money back into commodities before he has turned commodities into money 
in  other  words  he  achieves  the  second  metamorphosis  of  commodities  before  the  first  The 
sellers commodity circulates and realises its price but only in the shape of a legal claim upon 
money It is converted into a usevalue before it has been converted into money The completion 
of its first metamorphosis follows only at a later period  
The  obligations  falling  due  within  a  given  period  represent  the  sum  of  the  prices  of  the 
commodities the sale of which gave rise to those obligations The quantity of gold necessary to 
realise  this  sum  depends  in  the  first  instance  on  the  rapidity  of  currency  of  the  means  of 
payment That quantity is conditioned by two circumstances first the relations between debtors 
and creditors form a sort of chain in such a way that A when he receives money from his debtor 
B straightway hands it over to C his creditor and so on the second circumstance is the length of 
the  intervals  between  the  different  duedays  of  the  obligations  The  continuous  chain  of 
payments  or  retarded  first  metamorphoses  is  essentially  different  from  that  interlacing  of  the 
series  of  metamorphoses  which  we  considered  on  a  former  page  By  the  currency  of  the 
circulating  medium  the  connexion  between  buyers  and  sellers  is  not  merely  expressed  This 
connexion is originated by and exists in the circulation alone Contrariwise the movement of the 
means of payment expresses a social relation that was in existence long before  
The fact that a number of sales take place simultaneously and side by side limits the extent to 
which coin can be replaced by the rapidity of currency On the other hand this fact is a new lever 
in economising the means of payment In proportion as payments are concentrated at one spot 
special institutions and methods are developed for their liquidation Such in the middle ages were 
the virements at Lyons The debts due to A from B to B from C to C from A and so on have 
only to be confronted with each other in order to annul each other to a certain extent like positive 
and negative quantities There thus remains only a single balance to pay The greater the amount 
of the payments concentrated the less is this balance relatively to that amount and the less is the 
mass of the means of payment in circulation  
The  function  of  money  as  the  means  of  payment  implies  a  contradiction  without  a  terminus 
medius In so far as the payments balance one another money functions only ideally as money of 
account as a measure of value In so far as actual payments have to be made money does not 
serve as a circulating medium as a mere transient agent in the interchange of products but as the 
individual incarnation of social labour as the independent form of existence of exchangevalue 
as the universal commodity This contradiction comes to a head in those phases of industrial and 
commercial  crises  which are  known  as  monetary  crises  Such  a  crisis occurs only  where  the 
everlengthening  chain  of  payments  and  an  artificial  system  of  settling  them  has  been  fully 
developed Whenever there is a general and extensive disturbance of this mechanism no matter 
what  its  cause  money  becomes  suddenly  and  immediately  transformed  from  its  merely  ideal 
shape of money of account into hard cash Profane commodities can no longer replace it The 
usevalue of commodities becomes valueless and their value vanishes in the presence of its own 
independent form On the eve of the crisis the bourgeois with the selfsufficiency that springs 
from intoxicating prosperity declares money to be a vain imagination Commodities alone are 
money But now the cry is everywhere money alone is a commodity As the hart pants after fresh 

 

 

Chapter  
 
water  so  pants  his  soul  after  money  the  only  wealth  In  a  crisis  the  antithesis  between 
commodities and their  valueform  money  becomes  heightened  into an  absolute  contradiction 
Hence in  such  events the  form  under  which  money  appears is  of  no  importance The  money 
famine continues whether payments have to be made in gold or in credit money such as bank
notes  
If we now consider the sum total of the money current during a given period we shall find that 
given the rapidity of currency of the circulating medium and of the means of payment it is equal 
to  the  sum  of  the  prices  to  be  realised  plus  the  sum  of  the  payments  falling  due  minus  the 
payments that balance each other minus finally the number of circuits in which the same piece of 
coin serves in turn as means of circulation and of payment Hence even when prices rapidity of 
currency and the extent of the economy in payments are given the quantity of money current 
and  the  mass  of  commodities  circulating  during  a  given  period  such  as  a  day  no  longer 
correspond Money that represents commodities long withdrawn from circulation continues to be 
current Commodities circulate whose equivalent in money will not appear on the scene till some 
future day Moreover the debts contracted each day and the payments falling due on the same 
day are quite incommensurable quantities 
Creditmoney springs directly out of the function of money as a means of payment Certificates of 
the  debts  owing  for  the  purchased  commodities  circulate  for  the  purpose  of  transferring  those 
debts to others On the other hand to the same extent as the system of credit is extended so is the 
function of money as a  means of payment  In that character it takes various forms peculiar to 
itself under which it makes itself at home in the sphere of great commercial transactions Gold 
and silver coin on the other hand are mostly relegated to the sphere of retail trade 
When the production of commodities has sufficiently extended itself money begins to serve as 
the  means  of  payment  beyond  the  sphere  of  the  circulation  of  commodities  It  becomes  the 
commodity  that  is  the  universal  subjectmatter  of  all  contracts  Rents  taxes  and  such  like 
payments  are  transformed  from  payments  in  kind  into  money  payments  To  what  extent  this 
transformation depends upon the general conditions of production is shown to take one example 
by the fact that the Roman Empire twice failed in its attempt to levy all contributions in money 
The  unspeakable  misery  of  the  French  agricultural  population  under  Louis  XIV  a  misery  so 
eloquently denounced by Boisguillebert Marshal Vauban and others was due not only to the 
weight of the taxes but also to the conversion of taxes in kind into money taxes In Asia on the 
other hand the fact that state taxes are chiefly composed of rents payable in kind depends on 
conditions of production that are reproduced with the regularity of natural phenomena And this 
mode of payment tends in its turn to maintain the ancient form of production It is one of the 
secrets of the conservation of the Ottoman Empire If the foreign trade forced upon Japan by 
Europeans should lead to the substitution of money rents for rents in kind it will be all up with 
the  exemplary  agriculture  of  that  country  The  narrow  economic  conditions  under  which  that 
agriculture is carried on will be swept away  
In every country certain days of the year become by habit recognised settling days for various 
large and recurrent payments These dates depend apart from other revolutions in the wheel of 
reproduction on conditions closely connected with the seasons They also regulate the dates for 
payments that have no direct connexion with the circulation of commodities such as taxes rents 
and so on The quantity of money requisite to make the payments falling due on those dates all 
over the country causes periodical though merely superficial perturbations in the economy of 
the medium of payment  

 

 

Chapter  
 
From the law of the rapidity of currency of the means of payment it follows that the quantity of 
the means of payment required for all periodical payments whatever their source is in inverse 
proportion to the length of their periods  
The development of money into a medium of payment makes it necessary to accumulate money 
against the dates fixed for the payment of the sums owing While hoarding as a distinct mode of 
acquiring  riches  vanishes  with  the  progress  of  civil  society  the  formation  of  reserves  of  the 
means of payment grows with that progress  

C Universal Money 

When money leaves the home sphere of circulation it strips off the local garbs which it there 
assumes of a standard of prices of coin of tokens and of a symbol of value and returns to its 
original form of bullion In the trade between the markets of the world the value of commodities 
is expressed so as to be universally recognised Hence their independent valueform also in these 
cases confronts them under the shape of universal money It is only in the markets of the world 
that money acquires to the full extent the character of the commodity whose bodily form is also 
the immediate social incarnation of human labour in the abstract Its real mode of existence in this 
sphere adequately corresponds to its ideal concept  
Within the sphere of home circulation there can be but one commodity which by serving as a 
measure of value becomes money In the markets of the world a double measure of value holds 
sway gold and silver  
Money  of  the  world  serves  as  the  universal  medium  of  payment  as  the  universal  means  of 
purchasing and as the universally recognised embodiment of all wealth Its function as a means 
of payment in the settling of international balances is its chief one Hence the watchword of the 
mercantilists  balance  of  trade    Gold  and  silver  serve  as  international  means  of  purchasing 
chiefly  and  necessarily  in those  periods  when  the customary  equilibrium  in  the  interchange  of 
products between different nations is suddenly disturbed And lastly it serves as the universally 
recognised embodiment of social wealth whenever the question is not of buying or paying but of 
transferring wealth from one country to another and whenever this transference in the form of 
commodities  is  rendered  impossible  either  by  special  conjunctures  in  the  markets  or  by  the 
purpose itself that is intended  
Just as every country needs a reserve of money for its home circulation so too it requires one for 
external circulation in the markets of the world The functions of hoards therefore arise in part 
out of the function of money as the medium of the home circulation and home payments and in 
part  out  of  its function  of money  of  the  world    For  this latter function the  genuine  money
commodity actual gold and silver is necessary On that account Sir James Steuart in order to 
distinguish them from their purely local substitutes calls gold and silver money of the world  
The current of the stream of gold and silver is a double one On the one hand it spreads itself 
from  its  sources  over  all  the  markets  of  the  world  in  order  to  become  absorbed  to  various 
extents  into  the  different  national  spheres  of  circulation  to  fill  the  conduits  of  currency  to 
replace abraded gold and silver coins to supply the material of articles of luxury and to petrify 
into hoards This first current is started by the countries that exchange their labour realised in 
commodities  for  the  labour  embodied  in  the  precious  metals  by  gold  and  silverproducing 
countries On the other hand there is a continual flowing backwards and forwards of gold and 
silver between the different national spheres of circulation a current whose motion depends on 
the ceaseless fluctuations in the course of exchange  
Countries in which the bourgeois form of production is developed to a certain extent limit the 
hoards  concentrated in  the  strong  rooms  of  the  banks  to the  minimum  required  for the  proper 
 

 

Chapter  
 
performance  of  their  peculiar  functions  Whenever  these  hoards  are  strikingly  above  their 
average  level  it  is  with  some  exceptions  an  indication  of  stagnation  in  the  circulation  of 
commodities of an interruption in the even flow of their metamorphoses  
 
 
                                                      
 The question  Why does not money directly represent labourtime so that a piece of paper may 
represent  for  instance  x  hours  labour  is  at  bottom  the  same  as  the  question  why  given  the 
production of commodities must products take the form of commodities This is evident since their 
taking the form of commodities implies their differentiation into commodities and money Or why 
cannot private labour  labour for the account of private individuals  be treated as its opposite 
immediate social labour I have elsewhere examined thoroughly the Utopian idea of labourmoney 
in a society founded on the production of commodities l c p  seq On this point I will only say 
further that Owens labourmoney for instance is no more money than a ticket for the theatre 
Owen presupposes directly associated labour a form of production that is entirely inconsistent with 
the production of commodities The certificate of labour is merely evidence of the part taken by the 
individual in the common labour and of his right to a certain portion of the common produce destined 
for consumption But it never enters into Owens head to presuppose the production of commodities 
and  at  the  same  time  by  juggling  with  money  to  try  to  evade  the  necessary  conditions  of  that 
production 
 Savages and halfcivilised races use the tongue differently Captain Parry says of the inhabitants on 
the west coast of Baffins Bay In this case he refers to barter they licked it the thing represented to 
them  twice  to  their  tongues  after  which  they  seemed  to  consider  the  bargain  satisfactorily 
concluded In the same way the Eastern Esquimaux licked the articles they received in exchange If 
the tongue is thus used in the North as the organ of appropriation no wonder that in the South the 
stomach serves as the organ of accumulated property and that a Kaffir estimates the wealth of a man 
by the size of his belly That the Kaffirs know what they are about is shown by the following at the 
same time that the official British Health Report of  disclosed the deficiency of fatforming food 
among a large part of the workingclass a certain Dr Harvey not however the celebrated discoverer 
of the circulation of the blood made a good thing by advertising recipes for reducing the superfluous 
fat of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy 
 See Karl Marx Zur Kritik c Theorien von der Masseinheit des Geldes p  seq 
 Wherever gold and silver have by law been made to perform the function of money or of a measure 
of value side by side it has always been tried but in vain to treat them as one and the same material 
To assume that there is an invariable ratio between the quantities of gold and silver in which a given 
quantity of labourtime is incorporated is to assume in fact that gold and silver are of one and the 
same material and that a given mass of the less valuable metal silver is a constant fraction of a given 
mass of gold From the reign of Edward III to the time of George II the history of money in England 
consists of one long series of perturbations caused by the clashing of the legally fixed ratio between 
the values of gold and silver with the fluctuations in their real values At one time gold was too high 
at another silver The metal that for the time being was estimated below its value was withdrawn 
from circulation mated and exported The ratio between the two metals was then again altered by law 
but the new nominal ratio soon came into conflict again with the real one In our own times the slight 
and transient fall in the value of gold compared with silver which was a consequence of the Indo
Chinese demand for silver produced on a far more extended scale in France the same phenomena 
export of silver and its expulsion from circulation by gold During the years   and  the 
excess  in  France  of  goldimports  over  goldexports  amounted  to    while  the  excess  of

silverexports over silverimports was  In fact in those countries in which both metals 
are  legally  measures  of  value  and  therefore  both  legal  tender  so  that  everyone  has  the  option  of 
paying in either metal the metal that rises in value is at a premium and like every other commodity 
measures its price in the overestimated metal which alone serves in reality as the standard of value 
The  result  of  all  experience  and  history  with  regard  to  this  equation  is  simply  that  where  two 
commodities perform by law the functions of a measure of value in practice one alone maintains that 
position Karl Marx lc pp   
 The peculiar circumstance that while the ounce of gold serves in England as the unit of the standard 
of money the pound sterling does not form an aliquot part of it has been explained as follows Our 
coinage was originally adapted to the employment of silver only hence an ounce of silver can always 
be  divided  into  a  certain  adequate  number  of  pieces  of  coin  but  as  gold  was  introduced  at  a  later 
period into a coinage adapted only to silver an ounce of gold cannot be coined into an aliquot number 
of pieces Maclaren A Sketch of the History of the Currency London  p

  Owing  to  the  fact  that  money  when  serving  as  the  standard  of  price  appears  under  the  same

signify on the one hand an ounce weight of gold and on the other the value of a ton of iron this 
reckoning  name  of  money  has  been  called  its  mintprice  Hence  there  sprang  up  the  extraordinary 
notion that the value of gold is estimated in its own material and that in contradistinction to all other 
commodities its price is fixed by the State It was erroneously thought that the giving of reckoning 
names to definite weights of gold is the same thing as fixing the value of those weights Karl Marx

we are acquainted with nothing but the abstract categories of circulation which are common to all 
these modes of production we cannot possibly know anything of the specific points of difference of 
those  modes  nor  pronounce  any  judgment  upon  them  In  no  science  is  such  a  big  fuss  made  with

 Money being  the common measure of buying and selling everybody who hath anything to sell

in a small retail trade to change silver money and to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with 
the smallest silver pieces Now as the proportion of the number of farthings requisite in commerce 
is to be taken from the number of people the frequency of their exchanges as also and principally 
from  the  value  of  the  smallest  silver  pieces  of  money  so  in  like  manner  the  proportion  of  money

Kritik c p  He Adam Smith passes over without remark the question as to the quantity of 
coin  in  circulation  and  treats  money  quite  wrongly  as  a  mere  commodity  This  statement  applies 
only in so far as Adam Smith ex officio treats of money Now and then however as in his criticism 
of the earlier systems of Political Economy he takes the right view The quantity of coin in every 
country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it The value of 
the goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate 
and distribute them to their proper consumers and can give employment to no more The channel of 
circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it and never admits any more Wealth

division  of  labour  Afterwards  in  the  last  book  which  treats  of  the  sources  of  public  revenue  he

 The prices of things will certainly rise in every nation as the gold and silver increase amongst the 
people and consequently where the gold and silver decrease in any nation the prices of all things 
must  fall  proportionately  to  such  decrease  of  money  Jacob  Vanderlint  Money  Answers  all 
Things Lond  p  A careful comparison of this book with Humes Essays proves to my 
mind  without  doubt  that  Hume  was  acquainted  with  and  made  use  of  Vanderlints  work  which  is 
certainly an important one The opinion that prices are determined by the quantity of the circulating 
medium  was  also  held  by  Barbon  and  other  much  earlier  writers  No  inconvenience  says 
Vanderlint  can  arise  by  an  unrestrained  trade  but  very  great  advantage  since  if  the  cash  of  the 
nation be decreased by it which prohibitions are designed to prevent those nations that get the cash 
will  certainly  find  everything  advance  in  price  as  the  cash  increases  amongst  them  And    our 
manufactures and everything else will soon become so moderate as to turn the balance of trade in our 
favour and thereby fetch the money back again lc pp   
 That the price of each single kind of commodity forms a part of the sum of the prices of all the 
commodities 
is  a  selfevident  proposition  But  how  usevalues  which  are 
incommensurable with regard to each other are to be exchanged en masse for the total sum of gold 
and silver in a country is quite incomprehensible If we start from the notion that all commodities 
together  form  one  single  commodity  of  which  each  is  but  an  aliquot  part  we  get  the  following 
beautiful result The total commodity  x cwt of gold commodity A  an aliquot part of the total 
commodity  the same aliquot part of x cwt of gold This is stated in all seriousness by Montesquieu

 If silver never exceed what is wanted for the smaller payments it cannot be collected in sufficient 
quantities for the larger payments  the use of gold in the main payments necessarily implies also its 
use in the retail trade those who have gold coin offering them for small purchases and receiving with 
the  commodity  purchased  a  balance  of  silver  in  return  by  which  means  the  surplus  of  silver  that 
would otherwise encumber the retail dealer is drawn off and dispersed into general circulation But if 
there is as much silver as will transact the small payments independent of gold the retail trader must 
then  receive  silver  for  small  purchases  and  it  must  of  necessity  accumulate  in  his  hands  David

before  the  usevalue  of  the  money  is  realised  and  the  commodity  actually  delivered  This  occurs

Added in the th German edition  We find ourselves once more in a period of serious change in the 
relative values of gold and silver About  years ago the ratio expressing the relative value of gold 
and silver was  now it is approximately  and silver is still constantly falling as against 
gold This is essentially the result of a revolution in the mode of production of both metals Formerly 
gold was obtained almost exclusively by washing it out from goldbearing alluvial deposits products 
of the weathering of auriferous rocks Now this method has become inadequate and has been forced 
into  the  background  by  the  processing  of  the  quartz  lodes  themselves  a  way  of  extraction  which 
formerly was only of secondary importance although well known to the ancients Diodorus III 
  Diodors  v  Sicilien  Historische  Bibliothek  book  III    Stuttgart    pp   
Moreover not only were new huge silver deposits discovered in North America in the Western part 
of the Rocky Mountains but these and the Mexican silver mines were really opened up by the laying 
of railways which made possible the shipment of modern machinery and fuel and in consequence the 
mining of silver on a very large scale at a low cost However there is a great difference in the way the 
two  metals  occur  in  the  quartz  lodes  The  gold  is  mostly  native  but  disseminated  throughout  the 
quartz in minute quantities The whole mass of the vein must therefore be crushed and the gold either 
washed out or extracted by means of mercury Often  grammes of quartz barely yield  
and very seldom  grammes of gold Silver is seldom found native however it occurs in special 
quartz that is separated from the lode with comparative ease and contains mostly  silver or it 
is contained in smaller quantities in copper lead and other ores which in themselves are worthwhile 
working From this alone it is apparent that the labour expended on the production of gold is rather 
increasing while that expended on silver production has decidedly decreased which quite naturally 
explains the drop in the value of the latter This fall in value would express itself in a still greater fall 
in  price  if  the  price  of  silver  were  not  pegged  even  today  by  artificial  means  But  Americas  rich 
silver deposits have so far barely been tapped and thus the prospects are that the value of this metal 
will keep on dropping for rather a long time to come A still greater contributing factor here is the 
relative decrease in the requirement of  silver for articles of general use and for luxuries that is its 
replacement by plated goods aluminium etc One may thus gauge the utopianism of the bimetallist 
idea that compulsory international quotation will raise silver again to the old value ratio of  It 
is more likely that silver will forfeit its money function more and more in the markets of the world  
F E 
 The opponents themselves of the mercantile system a system which considered the settlement of 
surplus trade balances in gold and silver as the aim of international trade entirely misconceived the 
functions of money of the world I have shown by the example of Ricardo in what way their false

Chapter  The General Formula for Capital 

The circulation of commodities is the startingpoint of capital The production of commodities 
their circulation and that more developed form of their circulation called commerce these form 
the  historical  groundwork  from  which  it  rises  The  modern  history  of  capital  dates  from  the 
creation in the th century of a worldembracing commerce and a worldembracing market  
If  we  abstract  from  the  material substance  of the circulation  of  commodities  that is  from  the 
exchange  of  the  various  usevalues  and  consider  only  the  economic  forms  produced  by  this 
process of circulation we find its final result to be money this final product of the circulation of 
commodities is the first form in which capital appears  
As a matter of history capital as opposed to landed property invariably takes the form at first of 
money it appears as moneyed wealth as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer But we 
have no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover that the first form of appearance 
of capital is money We can see it daily under our very eyes All new capital to commence with 
comes on the stage that is on the market whether of commodities labour or money even in our 
days in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed into capital  
The first distinction we notice between money that is money only and money that is capital is 
nothing more than a difference in their form of circulation  
The  simplest  form  of  the  circulation  of  commodities  is  CMC  the  transformation  of 
commodities into money and the change of the money back again into commodities or selling in 
order to buy But alongside of this form we find another specifically different form MCM the 
transformation  of  money  into  commodities  and  the  change  of  commodities  back  again  into 
money  or  buying  in  order  to  sell  Money  that  circulates  in  the  latter  manner  is  thereby 
transformed into becomes capital and is already potentially capital  
Now let us examine the circuit MCM a little closer It consists like the other of two antithetical 
phases In the first phase MC or the purchase the money is changed into a commodity In the 
second  phase  CM  or  the  sale  the  commodity  is  changed  back  again  into  money  The 
combination of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money is exchanged 
for a commodity and the same commodity is again exchanged for money whereby a commodity 
is bought in order to be sold or neglecting the distinction in form between buying and selling 
whereby a commodity is bought with money and then money is bought with a commodity  The 
result in which the phases of the process vanish is the exchange of money for money MM If I 
purchase  lbs of cotton for  and resell the  lbs of cotton for  I have in fact 
exchanged  for  money for money  
Now it is evident that the circuit MCM would be absurd and without meaning if the intention 
were  to  exchange  by  this  means  two  equal  sums  of  money    for    The  misers  plan 
would  be far  simpler  and surer  he  sticks  to  his    instead  of exposing  it to  the  dangers of 
circulation And yet whether the merchant who has paid  for his cotton sells it for  or 
lets it go for  or even  his money has at all events gone through a characteristic and 
original movement quite different in kind from that which it goes through in the hands of the 
peasant  who  sells  corn  and  with  the  money  thus  set  free  buys  clothes  We  have  therefore  to 
examine first the distinguishing characteristics of the forms of the circuits MCM and CMC 
and in doing this the real difference that underlies the mere difference of form will reveal itself  
Let us see in the first place what the two forms have in common  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Both  circuits  are  resolvable  into  the  same  two  antithetical  phases  CM  a  sale  and  MC  a 
purchase In each of these phases the same material elements  a commodity and money and the 
same economic dramatis personae a buyer and a seller  confront one another Each circuit is the 
unity  of  the  same  two  antithetical  phases  and  in  each  case  this  unity  is  brought  about  by  the 
intervention of three contracting parties of whom one only sells another only buys while the 
third both buys and sells  
What however first and foremost distinguishes the circuit CMC from the circuit MCM is the 
inverted  order  of  succession  of  the  two  phases  The  simple  circulation  of  commodities  begins 
with a sale and ends  with a  purchase  while the  circulation  of  money  as  capital  begins  with a 
purchase  and  ends  with  a  sale  In  the  one  case  both  the  startingpoint  and  the  goal  are 
commodities in the other they are money In the first form the movement is brought about by the 
intervention of money in the second by that of a commodity  
In the circulation CMC the money is in the end converted into a commodity that serves as a 
usevalue it is spent once for all In the inverted form MCM on the contrary the buyer lays 
out money in order that as a seller he may recover money By the purchase of his commodity he 
throws money into circulation in order to withdraw it again by the sale of the same commodity 
He  lets  the  money  go  but  only  with  the  sly  intention  of  getting  it  back  again  The  money 
therefore is not spent it is merely advanced  
In the circuit CMC the same piece of money changes its place twice The seller gets it from the 
buyer and pays it away to another seller The complete circulation which begins with the receipt 
concludes with the payment of money for commodities It is the very contrary in the circuit MC
M Here it is not the piece of money that changes its place twice but the commodity The buyer 
takes it from the hands of the seller and passes it into the hands of another buyer Just as in the 
simple circulation of commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects 
its  passage  from  one  hand  into  another  so  here  the  double  change  of  place  of  the  same 
commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point of departure  
Such reflux is not dependent on the commodity being sold for more than was paid for it This 
circumstance influences only the amount of the money that comes back The reflux itself takes 
place so soon as the purchased commodity is resold in other words so soon as the circuit MC
M is completed We have here therefore a palpable difference between the circulation of money 
as capital and its circulation as mere money  
The circuit CMC comes completely to an end so soon as the money brought in by the sale of 
one commodity is abstracted again by the purchase of another  
If nevertheless there follows a reflux of money to its startingpoint this can only happen through 
a renewal or repetition of the operation If I sell a quarter of corn for  and with this  buy 
clothes the money so far as I am concerned is spent and done with It belongs to the clothes 
merchant If I now sell a second quarter of corn money indeed flows back to me not however as 
a sequel to the first transaction but in consequence of its repetition The money again leaves me 
so soon as I complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase Therefore in the circuit CM
C the expenditure of money has nothing to do with its reflux On the other hand in MCM the 
reflux of the money is conditioned by the very mode of its expenditure Without this reflux the 
operation  fails  or  the  process  is  interrupted  and  incomplete  owing  to  the  absence  of  its 
complementary and final phase the sale  
The  circuit  CMC  starts  with  one  commodity  and  finishes  with  another  which  falls  out  of 
circulation and into consumption Consumption the satisfaction of wants in one word usevalue 

 

 

Chapter  
 
is its end and aim The circuit MCM on the contrary commences with money and ends with 
money Its leading motive and the goal that attracts it is therefore mere exchangevalue  
In the simple circulation of commodities the two extremes of the circuit have the same economic 
form They are both commodities and commodities of equal value But they are also usevalues 
differing in their qualities as for example corn and clothes The exchange of products of the 
different  materials  in  which  the  labour  of  society  is  embodied  forms  here  the  basis  of  the 
movement  It  is  otherwise  in  the  circulation  MCM  which  at  first  sight  appears  purposeless 
because tautological Both extremes have the same economic form They are both money and 
therefore  are  not  qualitatively  different  usevalues  for  money  is  but  the  converted  form  of 
commodities in which their particular usevalues vanish To exchange  for cotton and then 
this same cotton again for  is merely a roundabout way of exchanging money for money the 
same for the same and appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd  One sum of 
money  is  distinguishable  from  another  only  by  its  amount  The  character  and  tendency  of  the 
process  MCM  is  therefore  not  due  to  any  qualitative  difference  between  its  extremes  both 
being  money  but  solely  to  their  quantitative  difference  More  money  is  withdrawn  from 
circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at the start The cotton that was bought for  is 
perhaps resold for    or  The exact form of this process is therefore MCM where 
M  M  D M  the original sum advanced plus an increment This increment or excess over the 
original value I call surplusvalue The value originally advanced therefore not only remains 
intact while in circulation but adds to itself a surplusvalue or expands itself It is this movement 
that converts it into capital  
Of course it is also possible that in CMC the two extremes CC say corn and clothes may 
represent different quantities of value The farmer may sell his corn above its value or may buy 
the clothes at less than their value He may on the other hand be done by the clothes merchant 
Yet  in  the  form  of  circulation  now  under  consideration  such  differences  in  value  are  purely 
accidental The fact that the corn and the clothes are equivalents does not deprive the process of 
all meaning as it does in MCM The equivalence of their values is rather a necessary condition 
to its normal course  
The repetition or renewal of the act of selling in order to buy is kept within bounds by the very 
object  it  aims  at  namely  consumption  or  the  satisfaction  of  definite  wants  an  aim  that  lies 
altogether outside the sphere of circulation But when we buy in order to sell we on the contrary 
begin and end with the same thing money exchangevalue and thereby the movement becomes 
interminable No doubt M becomes M  D M  become  But when viewed in their 
qualitative  aspect  alone    are  the  same  as    namely  money  and  considered 
quantitatively  is like  a sum of definite and limited value If now the  be spent 
as money they cease to play their part They are no longer capital Withdrawn from circulation 
they become petrified into a hoard and though they remained in that state till doomsday not a 
single farthing would accrue to them If then the expansion of value is once aimed at there is 
just the same inducement to augment the value of the  as that of the  for both are but 
limited expressions for exchangevalue and therefore both have the same vocation to approach 
by quantitative increase as near as possible to absolute wealth Momentarily indeed the value 
originally advanced the  is distinguishable from the surplusvalue of  that is annexed to 
it during circulation but the distinction vanishes immediately At the end of the process we do 
not receive with one hand the original  and with the other the surplusvalue of  We 
simply get a value of  which is in exactly the same condition and fitness for commencing 
the  expanding  process  as  the  original    was  Money  ends  the  movement  only  to  begin  it 
again Therefore the final result of every separate circuit in which a purchase and consequent 

 

 

Chapter  
 
sale are completed forms of itself the startingpoint of a new circuit The simple circulation of 
commodities  selling in order to buy  is a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with 
circulation namely the appropriation of usevalues the satisfaction of wants The circulation of 
money as capital is on the contrary an end in itself for the expansion of value takes place only 
within this constantly renewed movement The circulation of capital has therefore no limits  
As the conscious representative of this movement the possessor of money becomes a capitalist 
His person or rather his pocket is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns 
The expansion of value which is the objective basis or mainspring of the circulation MCM 
becomes his subjective aim and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more and more 
wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations that he functions as a capitalist 
that  is  as  capital  personified  and  endowed  with  consciousness  and  a  will  Usevalues  must 
therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist   neither must the profit on any 
single transaction The restless neverending process of profitmaking alone is what he aims at 
This boundless greed after riches this passionate chase after exchangevalue is common to the 
capitalist and the miser but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad the capitalist is a 
rational miser The neverending augmentation of exchangevalue which the miser strives after 
by  seeking  to  save  his  money  from  circulation  is  attained  by  the  more  acute  capitalist  by 
constantly throwing it afresh into circulation  
The independent form ie the moneyform which the value of commodities assumes in the case 
of simple circulation serves only one purpose namely their exchange and vanishes in the final 
result of the movement On the other hand in the circulation MCM both the money and the 
commodity  represent  only  different  modes  of  existence  of  value  itself  the  money  its  general 
mode and the commodity its particular or so to say disguised mode  It is constantly changing 
from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost and thus assumes an automatically 
active  character  If  now  we  take  in  turn each  of the two  different  forms  which  selfexpanding 
value  successively  assumes  in  the  course  of  its  life  we  then  arrive  at  these  two  propositions 
Capital is money Capital is commodities In truth however value is here the active factor in a 
process in which while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities it at 
the  same  time  changes  in  magnitude  differentiates  itself  by  throwing  off  surplusvalue  from 
itself the original value in other words expands spontaneously For the movement in the course 
of  which  it  adds  surplusvalue  is  its  own  movement  its  expansion  therefore  is  automatic 
expansion Because it is value it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to 
itself It brings forth living offspring or at the least lays golden eggs  
Value therefore being the active factor in such a process and assuming at one time the form of 
money  at  another  that  of  commodities  but  through  all  these  changes  preserving  itself  and 
expanding it requires some independent form by means of which its identity may at any time be 
established And this form it possesses only in the shape of money It is under the form of money 
that  value  begins  and  ends  and  begins  again  every  act  of  its  own  spontaneous  generation  It 
began by being  it is now  and so on But the money itself is only one of the two forms 
of value Unless it takes the form of some commodity it does not become capital There is here 
no antagonism as in the case of hoarding between the money and commodities The capitalist 
knows that all commodities however scurvy they may look or however badly they may smell 
are in faith and in truth money inwardly circumcised Jews and what is more a wonderful means 
whereby out of money to make more money  
In simple circulation CMC the value of commodities attained at the most a form independent 
of their usevalues ie the form of money but that same value now in the circulation MCM or 
the circulation of capital suddenly presents itself as an independent substance endowed with a 

 

 

Chapter  
 
motion of its own passing through a lifeprocess of its own in which money and commodities 
are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn Nay more instead of simply representing 
the  relations  of  commodities  it  enters  now  so  to  say  into  private  relations  with  itself  It 
differentiates  itself  as  original  value  from  itself  as  surplusvalue  as  the  father  differentiates 
himself from himself qua the son yet both are one and of one age for only by the surplusvalue 
of  does the  originally advanced become capital and so soon as this takes place so soon 
as the son and by the son the father is begotten so soon does their difference vanish and they 
again become one   
Value therefore now becomes value in process money in process and as such capital It comes 
out of circulation enters into it again preserves and multiplies itself within its circuit comes back 
out  of  it  with  expanded  bulk  and  begins  the  same  round  ever  afresh  MM  money  which 
begets  money  such  is  the  description  of  Capital  from  the  mouths  of  its  first  interpreters  the 
Mercantilists  
Buying  in  order  to  sell  or  more  accurately  buying  in  order  to  sell  dearer  MCM  appears 
certainly  to  be  a  form  peculiar  to  one  kind  of  capital  alone  namely  merchants  capital  But 
industrial  capital  too  is  money  that  is  changed  into  commodities  and  by  the  sale  of  these 
commodities is reconverted into more money The events that take place outside the sphere of 
circulation  in  the  interval  between  the  buying  and  selling  do  not  affect  the  form  of  this 
movement  Lastly  in  the  case  of  interestbearing  capital  the  circulation  MCM  appears 
abridged We have its result without the intermediate stage in the form MM en style lapidaire 
so to say money that is worth more money value that is greater than itself  
MCM is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it appears prima facie within the 
sphere of circulation 
                                                      
 The contrast between the power based on the personal relations of dominion and servitude that is 
conferred by landed property and the impersonal power that is given by money is well expressed by 
the two French proverbs Nulle terre sans seigneur and Largent na pas de matre  No land 
without its lord and Money has no master

 Aristotle opposes Oeconomic to Chrematistic He starts from the former So far as it is the art of 
gaining a livelihood it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence and 
useful either to a household or the state True wealth o aleqinos ploutos consists of such values 
in  use  for  the  quantity  of  possessions  of  this  kind  capable  of  making  life  pleasant  is  not 
unlimited There is however a second mode of acquiring things to which we may by preference 
and with correctness give the name of Chrematistic and in this case there appear to be no limits 
to riches and possessions Trade e kapelike is literally retail trade and Aristotle takes this kind 
because in it values in use predominate does not in its nature belong to Chrematistic for here the 
exchange has reference only to what is necessary to themselves the buyer or seller Therefore 
as he goes on to show the original form of trade was barter but with the extension of the latter 
there arose the necessity for money On the discovery of money barter of necessity developed 
into kapelike into trading in commodities and this again in opposition to its original tendency 
grew into Chrematistic into the art of making money Now Chrematistic is distinguishable from 
Oeconomic  in  this  way  that  in  the  case  of  Chrematistic  circulation  is  the  source  of  riches

is  the  beginning  and  end  of  this  kind  of  exchange  to  nomisma  stoiceion  tes  allages  estin 
Therefore also riches such as Chrematistic strives for are unlimited Just as every art that is not a 
means  to  an  end  but  an  end  in  itself  has  no  limit  to  its  aims  because  it  seeks  constantly  to 
approach  nearer  and  nearer  to  that  end  while  those  arts  that  pursue  means  to  an  end  are  not 
boundless since  the  goal  itself imposes  a  limit  upon  them  so  with  Chrematistic  there  are  no 
bounds to its aims these aims being absolute wealth Oeconomic not Chrematistic has a limit  
the  object  of  the  former  is  something  different  from  money  of  the  latter  the  augmentation  of 
money By confounding these two forms which overlap each other some people have been led 
to  look  upon  the  preservation  and  increase  of  money  ad  infinitum  as  the  end  and  aim  of

Chapter  Contradictions in the General 

Formula of Capital 

The form which circulation takes when money becomes capital is opposed to all the laws we 
have hitherto investigated bearing on the nature of commodities value and money and even of 
circulation itself What distinguishes this form from that of the simple circulation of commodities 
is the inverted order of succession of the two antithetical processes sale and purchase How can 
this purely formal distinction between these processes change their character as it were by magic  
But that is not all This inversion has no existence for two out of the three persons who transact 
business together As capitalist I buy commodities from A and sell them again to B but as a 
simple owner of commodities I sell them to B and then purchase fresh ones from A A and B see 
no difference between the two sets of transactions They are merely buyers or sellers And I on 
each occasion meet them as a mere owner of either money or commodities as a buyer or a seller 
and what is more in both sets of transactions I am opposed to A only as a buyer and to B only as 
a seller to the one only as money to the other only as commodities and to neither of them as 
capital or a capitalist or as representative of anything that is more than money or commodities or 
that can produce any effect beyond what money and commodities can For me the purchase from 
A and the sale to B are part of a series But the connexion between the two acts exists for me 
alone A does not trouble himself about my transaction with B nor does B about my business 
with A And if I offered to explain to them the meritorious nature of my action in inverting the 
order of succession they would probably point out to me that I was mistaken as to that order of 
succession and that the whole transaction instead of beginning with a purchase and ending with 
a sale began on the contrary with a sale and was concluded with a purchase In truth my first 
act the purchase was from the standpoint of A a sale and my second act the sale was from the 
standpoint of B a purchase Not content with that A and B would declare that the whole series 
was superfluous and nothing but Hokus Pokus that for the future A would buy direct from B and 
B  sell  direct  to  A  Thus  the  whole  transaction  would  be  reduced  to  a  single  act  forming  an 
isolated noncomplemented phase in the ordinary circulation of commodities a mere sale from 
As  point  of  view  and  from  Bs  a  mere  purchase  The  inversion  therefore  of  the  order  of 
succession does not take us outside the sphere of the simple circulation of commodities and we 
must rather look whether there is in this simple circulation anything permitting an expansion of 
the value that enters into circulation and consequently a creation of surplusvalue  
Let us take the process of circulation in a form under which it presents itself as a simple and 
direct exchange of commodities This is always the case when two owners of commodities buy 
from each other and on the settling day the amounts mutually owing are equal and cancel each 
other  The  money  in  this  case  is  money  of  account  and  serves  to  express  the  value  of  the 
commodities by their prices but is not itself in the shape of hard cash confronted with them So 
far as regards usevalues it is clear that both parties may gain some advantage Both part with 
goods that as usevalues are of no service to them and receive others that they can make use of 
And there may also be a further gain A who sells wine and buys corn possibly produces more 
wine  with  given  labourtime  than  farmer  B  could  and  B  on  the  other  hand  more  corn  than 
winegrower  A  could  A  therefore  may  get  for  the  same  exchangevalue  more  corn  and  B 
more wine than each would respectively get without any exchange by producing his own corn 
and wine With reference therefore to usevalue there is good ground for saying that exchange 
is a transaction by which both sides gain It is otherwise with exchangevalue A man who has 
 

 

Chapter  
 
plenty of wine and no corn treats with a man who has plenty of corn and no wine an exchange 
takes  place  between  them  of  corn  to  the  value  of    for  wine  of  the  same  value  This  act 
produces no increase of exchangevalue either for the one or the other for each of them already 
possessed  before  the  exchange  a  value  equal  to  that  which  he  acquired  by  means  of  that 
operation The result is not altered by introducing money as a medium of circulation between 
the  commodities  and  making  the  sale  and  the  purchase  two  distinct  acts  The  value  of  a 
commodity is expressed in its price before it goes into circulation and is therefore a precedent 
condition of circulation not its result  
Abstractedly considered that is apart from circumstances not immediately flowing from the laws 
of  the  simple  circulation  of  commodities  there  is  in  an  exchange  nothing  if  we  except  the 
replacing of one usevalue by another but a metamorphosis a mere change in the form of the 
commodity  The  same  exchangevalue  ie  the  same  quantity  of  incorporated  social  labour 
remains throughout in the hands of the owner of the commodity first in the shape of his own 
commodity then in the form of the money for which he exchanged it and lastly in the shape of 
the commodity he buys with that money This change of form does not imply a change in the 
magnitude  of  the  value  But  the  change  which  the  value  of  the  commodity  undergoes  in  this 
process  is  limited  to  a  change  in  its  moneyform  This  form  exists  first  as  the  price  of  the 
commodity  offered  for  sale  then  as  an  actual  sum  of  money  which  however  was  already 
expressed in the price and lastly as the price of an equivalent commodity This change of form 
no more implies taken alone a change in the quantity of value than does the change of a  note 
into sovereigns half sovereigns and shillings So far therefore as the circulation of commodities 
effects a change in the form alone of their values and is free from disturbing influences it must 
be the exchange of equivalents Little as VulgarEconomy knows about the nature of value yet 
whenever  it  wishes  to  consider  the  phenomena  of  circulation  in  their  purity  it  assumes  that 
supply  and  demand  are  equal  which  amounts  to  this  that  their  effect  is  nil  If  therefore  as 
regards the usevalues exchanged both buyer and seller may possibly gain something this is not 
the case as regards the exchangevalues Here we must rather say Where equality exists there 
can be no gain It is true commodities may be sold at prices deviating from their values but 
these deviations are to be considered as infractions of the laws of the exchange of commodities 
which in its normal state is an exchange of equivalents consequently no method for increasing 
value  
Hence we see that behind all attempts to represent the circulation of commodities as a source of 
surplusvalue  there  lurks  a  quid  pro  quo  a  mixing  up  of  usevalue  and  exchangevalue  For 
instance Condillac says It is not true that on an exchange of commodities we give value for 
value On the contrary each of the two contracting parties in every case gives a less for a greater 
value  If we really exchanged equal values neither party could make a profit And yet they 
both gain or ought to gain Why The value of a thing consists solely in its relation to our wants 
What is more to the one is less to the other and vice vers  It is not to be assumed that we offer 
for sale articles required for our own consumption  We wish to part with a useless thing in 
order to get one that we need we want to give less for more  It was natural to think that in an 
exchange value was given for value whenever each of the articles exchanged was of equal value 
with the same quantity of gold  But there is another point to be considered in our calculation 
The question is whether we both exchange something superfluous for something necessary   
We see in this passage how Condillac not only confuses usevalue with exchangevalue but in a 
really childish manner assumes that in a society in which the production of commodities is well 
developed  each  producer  produces  his  own  means  of  subsistence  and  throws  into  circulation 
only  the  excess  over  his  own  requirements  Still  Condillacs  argument  is  frequently  used  by 

 

 

Chapter  
 
modern economists more especially when the point is to show that the exchange of commodities 
in  its  developed  form  commerce  is  productive  of  surplusvalue  For  instance  Commerce   
adds value to products for the same products in the hands of consumers are worth more than in 
the  hands  of  producers  and  it  may  strictly  be  considered  an  act  of  production  But 
commodities are not paid for twice over once on account of their usevalue and again on account 
of their value And though the usevalue of a commodity is more serviceable to the buyer than to 
the seller its moneyform is more serviceable to the seller Would he otherwise sell it We might 
therefore just as well say that the buyer performs strictly an act of production by converting 
stockings for example into money  
If  commodities  or  commodities  and  money  of  equal  exchangevalue  and  consequently 
equivalents are exchanged it is plain that no one abstracts more value from than he throws into 
circulation  There  is  no  creation  of  surplusvalue  And  in  its  normal  form  the  circulation  of 
commodities demands the exchange of equivalents But in actual practice the process does not 
retain its normal form Let us therefore assume an exchange of nonequivalents  
In any case the market for commodities is only frequented by owners of commodities and the 
power  which  these  persons  exercise  over  each  other  is  no  other  than  the  power  of  their 
commodities The material variety of these commodities is the material incentive to the act of 
exchange and makes buyers and sellers mutually dependent because none of them possesses the 
object of his own wants and each holds in his hand the object of anothers wants Besides these 
material differences of their usevalues there is only one other difference between commodities 
namely that between their bodily form and the form into which they are converted by sale the 
difference between commodities and money And consequently the owners of commodities are 
distinguishable only as sellers those who own commodities and buyers those who own money  
Suppose then that by some inexplicable privilege the seller is enabled to sell his commodities 
above their value what is worth  for  in which case the price is nominally raised  
The seller therefore pockets a surplusvalue of  But after he has sold he becomes a buyer A 
third  owner  of  commodities  comes  to  him  now  as  seller  who in  this  capacity  also  enjoys  the 
privilege of selling his commodities  too dear Our friend gained  as a seller only to lose it 
again  as  a  buyer  The  net  result  is  that  all  owners  of  commodities  sell  their  goods  to  one 
another at  above their value which comes precisely to the same as if they sold them at their 
true value Such a general and nominal rise of prices has the same effect as if the values had been 
expressed in weight of silver instead of in weight of gold The nominal prices of commodities 
would rise but the real relation between their values would remain unchanged  
Let us make the opposite assumption that the buyer has the privilege of purchasing commodities 
under their value In this case it is no longer necessary to bear in mind that he in his turn will 
become a seller He was so before he became buyer he had already lost  in selling before he 
gained  as buyer Everything is just as it was  
The  creation  of  surplusvalue  and  therefore  the  conversion  of  money  into  capital  can 
consequently be explained neither on the assumption that commodities are sold above their value 
nor that they are bought below their value  
The problem is in no way simplified by introducing irrelevant matters after the manner of Col 
Torrens Effectual demand consists in the power and inclination  on the part of consumers to 
give for commodities either by immediate or circuitous barter some greater portion of  capital 
than their production costs In relation to circulation producers and consumers meet only as 
buyers and sellers To assert that the surplusvalue acquired by the producer has its origin in the 
fact that consumers pay for commodities more than their value is only to say in other words The 
owner  of  commodities  possesses  as  a  seller  the  privilege  of  selling  too  dear  The  seller  has 
 

 

Chapter  
 
himself produced the commodities or represents their producer but the buyer has to no less extent 
produced the commodities represented by his money or represents their producer The distinction 
between them is that one buys and the other sells The fact that the owner of the commodities 
under  the  designation  of  producer  sells  them  over  their  value  and  under  the  designation  of 
consumer pays too much for them does not carry us a single step further  
To  be  consistent  therefore  the  upholders  of  the  delusion  that  surplusvalue  has  its  origin  in  a 
nominal rise of prices or in the privilege which the seller has of selling too dear must assume the 
existence of a class that only buys and does not sell ie only consumes and does not produce 
The existence of such a class is inexplicable from the standpoint we have so far reached viz that 
of  simple  circulation  But  let  us  anticipate  The  money  with  which  such  a  class  is  constantly 
making  purchases  must  constantly  flow  into  their  pockets  without  any  exchange  gratis  by 
might  or  right  from  the  pockets  of  the  commodityowners  themselves  To  sell  commodities 
above their value to such a class is only to crib back again a part of the money previously given 
to it The towns of Asia Minor thus paid a yearly money tribute to ancient Rome With this 
money Rome purchased from them commodities and purchased them too dear The provincials 
cheated the Romans and thus got back from their conquerors in the course of trade a portion of 
the tribute Yet for all that the conquered were the really cheated Their goods were still paid for 
with their own money That is not the way to get rich or to create surplusvalue  
Let us therefore keep within the bounds of exchange where sellers are also buyers and buyers 
sellers Our difficulty may perhaps have arisen from treating the actors as personifications instead 
of as individuals  
A may be clever enough to get the advantage of B or C without their being able to retaliate A 
sells wine worth  to B and obtains from him in exchange corn to the value of  A has 
converted his  into  has made more money out of less and has converted his commodities 
into capital Let us examine this a little more closely Before the exchange we had  worth of 
wine  in  the  hands  of  A  and    worth  of  corn  in  those  of  B  a  total  value  of    After  the 
exchange we have still the same total value of  The value in circulation has not increased by 
one iota it is only distributed differently between A and B What is a loss of value to B is surplus
value to A what is minus to one is plus to the other The same change would have taken 
place if A without the formality of an exchange had directly stolen the  from B The sum of 
the values in circulation can clearly not be augmented by any change in their distribution any 
more  than  the  quantity  of  the  precious  metals  in  a  country  by  a  Jew  selling  a  Queen  Annes 
farthing  for  a  guinea  The  capitalist  class  as  a  whole  in  any  country  cannot  overreach 
themselves  
Turn  and  twist  then  as  we  may  the  fact  remains  unaltered  If  equivalents  are  exchanged  no 
surplusvalue results and if nonequivalents are exchanged still no surplusvalue  Circulation 
or the exchange of commodities begets no value  
The reason is now therefore plain why in analysing the standard form of capital the form under 
which  it  determines  the  economic  organisation  of  modern  society  we  entirely  left  out  of 
consideration its most popular and so to say antediluvian forms merchants capital and money
lenders capital  
The circuit MCM buying in order to sell dearer is seen most clearly in genuine merchants 
capital But the movement takes place entirely within the sphere of circulation Since however it 
is impossible by circulation alone to account for the conversion of money into capital for the 
formation of surplusvalue it would appear that merchants capital is an impossibility so long as 
equivalents are exchanged that therefore it can only have its origin in the twofold advantage 
gained over both the selling and the buying producers by the merchant who parasitically shoves 
 

Chapter  
 
himself  in  between  them  It  is  in  this  sense  that  Franklin  says  war  is  robbery  commerce  is 
generally cheating If the transformation of merchants money into capital is to be explained 
otherwise than by the producers being simply cheated a long series of intermediate steps would 
be  necessary  which  at  present  when  the  simple  circulation  of  commodities  forms  our  only 
assumption are entirely wanting  

 

What we have said with reference to merchants capital applies still more to 
moneylenders capital In merchants capital the two extremes the money that is 
thrown upon the market and the augmented money that is withdrawn from the 
market are at least connected by a purchase and a sale in other words by the 
movement of the circulation In moneylenders capital the form MCM is 
reduced to the two extremes without a mean MM  money exchanged for more 
money a form that is incompatible with the nature of money and therefore 
remains inexplicable from the standpoint of the circulation of commodities Hence 
Aristotle since chrematistic is a double science one part belonging to 
commerce the other to economic the latter being necessary and praiseworthy the 
former based on circulation and with justice disapproved for it is not based on 
Nature but on mutual cheating therefore the usurer is most rightly hated 
because money itself is the source of his gain and is not used for the purposes for 
which it was invented For it originated for the exchange of commodities but 
interest makes out of money more money Hence its name  interest and 
offspring For the begotten are like those who beget them But interest is money 
of money so that of all modes of making a living this is the most contrary to 
Nature  

In the course of our investigation we shall find that both merchants capital and interestbearing 
capital  are  derivative  forms  and  at  the  same  time  it  will  become  clear  why  these  two  forms 
appear in the course of history before the modern standard form of capital  
We  have  shown  that  surplusvalue  cannot  be  created  by  circulation  and  therefore  that  in  its 
formation something must take place in the background which is not apparent in the circulation 
itself But can surplusvalue possibly originate anywhere else than in circulation which is the 
sum total of all the mutual relations of commodityowners as far as they are determined by their 
commodities  Apart  from  circulation  the  commodityowner  is  in  relation  only  with  his  own 
commodity So far as regards value that relation is limited to this that the commodity contains a 
quantity  of  his  own  labour  that  quantity  being  measured  by  a  definite  social  standard  This 
quantity is expressed by the value of the commodity and since the value is reckoned in money of 
account this quantity is also expressed by the price which we will suppose to be  But his 
labour is not represented both by the value of the commodity and by a surplus over that value 
not  by  a  price  of    that  is  also  a  price  of    not  by  a  value  that  is  greater  than  itself  The 
commodity owner can by his labour create value but not selfexpanding value He can increase 
the  value  of  his  commodity  by  adding  fresh  labour  and  therefore  more  value  to  the  value  in 
hand by making for instance leather into boots The same material has now more value because 
it contains a greater quantity of labour The boots have therefore more value than the leather but 
the value of the leather remains what it was it has not expanded itself has not during the making 
of  the  boots  annexed  surplusvalue  It  is  therefore  impossible  that  outside  the  sphere  of 
circulation a producer of commodities can without coming into contact with other commodity
owners expand value and consequently convert money or commodities into capital  

 

 

Chapter  
 
It is therefore impossible for capital to be produced by circulation and it is equally impossible for 
it  to  originate apart  from  circulation  It  must  have  its  origin  both  in  circulation  and  yet  not in 
circulation  
We have therefore got a double result  
The conversion of money into capital has to be explained on the basis of the laws that regulate the 
exchange of commodities in such a way that the startingpoint is the exchange of equivalents 
Our friend Moneybags who as yet is only an embryo capitalist must buy his commodities at 
their value must sell them at their value and yet at the end of the process must withdraw more 
value  from  circulation  than  he  threw  into  it  at  starting  His  development  into  a  fullgrown 
capitalist  must  take  place  both  within  the  sphere  of  circulation  and  without  it  These  are  the 
conditions of the problem Hic Rhodus hic salta

  From  the  foregoing  investigation  the  reader  will  see  that  this  statement  only  means  that  the 
formation of capital must be possible even though the price and value of a commodity be the same for 
its formation cannot be attributed to any deviation of the one from the other If prices actually differ 
from values we must first of all reduce the former to the latter in other words treat the difference as 
accidental  in  order  that  the  phenomena  may  be  observed  in  their  purity  and  our  observations  not 
interfered with by disturbing circumstances that have nothing to do with the process in question We 
know moreover that this reduction is no mere scientific process The continual oscillations in prices 
their rising and falling compensate each other and reduce themselves to an average price which is 
their  hidden  regulator  It  forms  the  guiding  star  of  the  merchant  or  the  manufacturer  in  every 
undertaking that requires time He knows that when a long period of time is taken commodities are 
sold neither over nor under but at their average price If therefore he thought about the matter at all 
he would formulate the problem of the formation of capital as follows How can we account for the 
origin of capital on the supposition that prices are regulated by the average price i e ultimately by 
the value of the commodities I say ultimately because average prices do not directly coincide with 
the values of commodities as Adam Smith Ricardo and others believe

The story is that an athlete boasts that when in Rhodes he performed a stupendous jump and that 
there were witnesses who could back up his story A bystander then remarked Alright Lets say this 
is Rhodes demonstrate the jump here and now The fable shows that people must be known by their 
deeds not by their own claims for themselves In the context in which Hegel used it in the Philosophy 
of Right this could be taken to mean that the philosophy of right must have to do with the actuality of 
modern society not the theories and ideals that societies create for themselves nor as Hegel goes on 
to say to teach the world what it ought to be 
The epigram is given by Hegel first in Greek then in Latin in the form Hic Rhodus hic saltus and 
he then says With little change the above saying would read in German Hier ist die Rose hier

This is taken to be an allusion to the rose in the cross of the Rosicrucians who claimed to possess 
esoteric  knowledge  with  which  they  could  transform  social  life  implying  that  the  material  for

Chapter  The Buying and Selling of Labour

Power 

The change of value that occurs in the case of money intended to be converted into capital cannot 
take place in the money itself since in its function of means of purchase and of payment it does 
no more than realise the price of the commodity it buys or pays for and as hard cash it is value 
petrified never varying Just as little can it originate in the second act of circulation the resale 
of the commodity which does no more than transform the article from its bodily form back again 
into its moneyform The change must therefore take place in the commodity bought by the first 
act MC but not in its value for equivalents are exchanged and the commodity is paid for at its 
full value We are therefore forced to the conclusion that the change originates in the usevalue 
as such of the commodity ie in its consumption In order to be able to extract value from the 
consumption of  a commodity  our friend Moneybags  must  be  so  lucky  as  to  find  within  the 
sphere  of  circulation  in  the  market  a  commodity  whose  usevalue  possesses  the  peculiar 
property of being a source of value whose actual consumption therefore is itself an embodiment 
of labour and consequently a creation of value The possessor of money does find on the market 
such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labourpower  
By labourpower or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and 
physical capabilities existing in a human being which he exercises whenever he produces a use
value of any description  
But  in  order  that our  owner  of  money  may  be  able to  find labourpower  offered  for  sale  as a 
commodity  various  conditions  must  first  be  fulfilled  The  exchange  of  commodities  of  itself 
implies no other relations of dependence than those which result from its own nature On this 
assumption labourpower can appear upon the market as a commodity only if and so far as its 
possessor the individual whose labourpower it is offers it for sale or sells it as a commodity In 
order that he may be able to do this he must have it at his disposal must be the untrammelled 
owner of his capacity for labour ie of his person He and the owner of money  meet in the 
market and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights with this difference alone that 
one is buyer the other seller both therefore equal in the eyes of the law The continuance of this 
relation demands that the owner of the labourpower should sell it only for a definite period for if 
he were to sell it rump and stump once for all he would be selling himself converting himself 
from  a  free  man  into  a  slave  from  an  owner  of  a  commodity  into  a  commodity  He  must 
constantly look upon his labourpower as his own property his own commodity and this he can 
only do by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily for a definite period of time By this 
means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it  
The second essential condition to the owner of money finding labourpower in the market as a 
commodity is this  that the labourer instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which 
his labour is incorporated  must  be  obliged  to  offer for sale  as  a  commodity  that  very  labour
power which exists only in his living self  
In order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labourpower he must of course 
have the means of production as raw material implements c No boots can be made without 
leather He requires also the means of subsistence Nobody  not even a musician of the future 
 can live upon future products or upon usevalues in an unfinished state and ever since the first 
moment  of  his  appearance  on  the  worlds  stage  man  always  has  been  and  must  still  be  a 
consumer both before and while he is producing In a society where all products assume the form 
 

 

Chapter  
 
of commodities these commodities must be sold after they have been produced it is only after 
their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of their producer The time necessary 
for their sale is superadded to that necessary for their production  
For the conversion of his money into capital therefore the owner of money  must meet in the 
market with the free labourer free in the double sense that as a free man he can dispose of his 
labourpower as his own commodity and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for 
sale is short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labourpower  
The question why this free labourer confronts him in the market has no interest for the owner of 
money who regards the labourmarket as a branch of the general market for commodities And 
for the present it interests us just as little We cling to the fact theoretically as he does practically 
One  thing  however  is  clear    Nature  does  not  produce  on  the  one  side  owners  of  money  or 
commodities and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labourpower This relation 
has no natural basis neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods It is 
clearly the result of a past historical development the product of many economic revolutions of 
the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production  
So  too  the  economic  categories  already  discussed  by  us  bear  the  stamp  of  history  Definite 
historical  conditions  are  necessary  that  a  product  may  become  a  commodity  It  must  not  be 
produced as the immediate means of subsistence of the producer himself Had we gone further 
and  inquired  under  what  circumstances  all  or  even  the  majority  of  products  take  the  form  of 
commodities we should have found that this can only happen with production of a very specific 
kind capitalist production Such an inquiry however would have been foreign to the analysis of 
commodities Production and circulation of commodities can take place although the great mass 
of the objects produced are intended for the immediate requirements of their producers are not 
turned into commodities and consequently social production is not yet by a long way dominated 
in  its  length  and  breadth  by  exchangevalue  The  appearance  of  products  as  commodities  pre
supposes  such  a  development  of  the  social division of  labour  that the  separation  of  usevalue 
from  exchangevalue  a  separation  which  first  begins  with  barter  must  already  have  been 
completed  But such  a degree of development is common  to  many  forms  of  society  which  in 
other  respects  present  the  most  varying  historical  features  On  the  other  hand  if  we  consider 
money  its  existence  implies  a  definite  stage  in  the  exchange  of  commodities  The  particular 
functions of money which it performs either as the mere equivalent of commodities or as means 
of  circulation  or  means  of  payment  as  hoard  or  as  universal  money  point  according  to  the 
extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other to very different stages in the 
process  of  social  production  Yet  we  know  by  experience  that  a  circulation  of  commodities 
relatively primitive suffices for the production of all these forms Otherwise with capital The 
historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the mere circulation of money 
and commodities It can spring into life only when the owner of the means of production and 
subsistence  meets  in  the  market  with  the  free  labourer  selling  his  labourpower  And  this  one 
historical  condition  comprises  a  worlds  history  Capital  therefore  announces  from  its  first 
appearance a new epoch in the process of social production  
We must now examine more closely this peculiar commodity labourpower Like all others it has 
a value How is that value determined  
The value of labourpower is determined as in the case of every other commodity by the labour
time necessary for the production and consequently also the reproduction of this special article 
So  far  as  it  has  value  it  represents  no  more  than  a  definite  quantity  of  the  average  labour  of 
society  incorporated  in  it  Labourpower  exists  only  as  a  capacity  or  power  of  the  living 
individual  Its  production  consequently  presupposes  his  existence  Given  the  individual  the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
production of labourpower consists in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance For his 
maintenance he requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence Therefore the labourtime 
requisite for the production of labourpower reduces itself to that necessary for the production of 
those means of subsistence in other words the value of labourpower is the value of the means of 
subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer Labourpower however becomes a 
reality only by its exercise it sets itself in action only by working But thereby a definite quantity 
of human muscle nerve brain c is wasted and these require to be restored This increased 
expenditure demands a larger income If the owner of labourpower works today tomorrow he 
must  again  be  able  to  repeat  the  same  process  in  the  same  conditions  as  regards  health  and 
strength His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state 
as  a  labouring  individual  His  natural  wants  such  as  food  clothing  fuel  and  housing  vary 
according  to the climatic and  other  physical  conditions  of  his country  On  the  other  hand the 
number and extent of his socalled necessary wants as also the modes of satisfying them are 
themselves the product of historical development and depend therefore to a great extent on the 
degree  of  civilisation  of  a  country  more  particularly  on  the  conditions  under  which  and 
consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which the class of free labourers has been 
formed  In  contradistinction  therefore  to  the  case  of  other  commodities  there  enters  into  the 
determination  of  the  value  of  labourpower  a  historical  and  moral  element  Nevertheless  in  a 
given country at a given period the average quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for 
the labourer is practically known  
The owner of labourpower is mortal If then his appearance in the market is to be continuous 
and  the  continuous  conversion  of  money  into  capital  assumes  this  the  seller  of  labourpower 
must  perpetuate  himself  in  the  way  that  every  living  individual  perpetuates  himself  by 
procreation The labourpower withdrawn from the market by wear and tear and death must be 
continually replaced by at the very least an equal amount of fresh labourpower Hence the sum 
of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labourpower must include the means 
necessary  for  the  labourers  substitutes  ie  his  children  in  order  that  this  race  of  peculiar 
commodityowners may perpetuate its appearance in the market  
In  order to  modify the  human  organism  so that it may  acquire skill  and  handiness in a  given 
branch of industry and become labourpower of a special kind a special education or training is 
requisite and this on its part costs an equivalent in commodities of a greater or less amount 
This amount varies according to the more or less complicated character of the labourpower The 
expenses  of this  education  excessively  small  in  the case  of  ordinary  labourpower  enter  pro 
tanto into the total value spent in its production  
The value of labourpower resolves itself into the value of a definite quantity of the means of 
subsistence  It  therefore  varies  with  the  value  of  these  means  or  with  the  quantity  of  labour 
requisite for their production  
Some of the means of subsistence such as food and fuel are consumed daily and a fresh supply 
must be provided daily Others such as clothes and furniture last for longer periods and require to 
be replaced only at longer intervals One article must be bought or paid for daily another weekly 
another quarterly and so on But in whatever way the sum total of these outlays may be spread 
over the year they must be covered by the average income taking one day with another If the 
total  of  the  commodities  required  daily  for  the  production  of  labourpower    A  and  those 
required  weekly    B  and  those  required  quarterly    C  and  so  on  the  daily  average  of  these 
commodities    A    B    C    c      Suppose  that  in  this  mass  of  commodities 
requisite  for  the  average  day  there  are  embodied    hours  of  social  labour  then  there  is 
incorporated daily in labourpower half a days average social labour in other words half a days 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour is requisite for the daily production of labourpower This quantity of labour forms the 
value of a days labourpower or the value of the labourpower daily reproduced If half a days 
average  social  labour  is  incorporated  in  three  shillings  then  three  shillings  is  the  price 
corresponding to the value of a days labourpower If its owner therefore offers it for sale at three 
shillings a day its selling price is equal to its value and according to our supposition our friend 
Moneybags who is intent upon converting his three shillings into capital pays this value  
The minimum limit of the value of labourpower is determined by the value of the commodities 
without the daily supply of which the labourer cannot renew his vital energy consequently by the 
value of those means of subsistence that are physically indispensable If the price of labourpower 
fall to this minimum it falls below its value since under such circumstances it can be maintained 
and developed only in a crippled state But the value of every commodity is determined by the 
labourtime requisite to turn it out so as to be of normal quality  
It is a very cheap sort of sentimentality which declares this method of determining the value of 
labourpower  a  method  prescribed  by  the  very  nature  of  the  case  to  be  a  brutal  method  and 
which  wails  with  Rossi  that To comprehend  capacity  for labour  puissance  de  travail  at  the 
same time that we make abstraction from the means of subsistence of the labourers during the 
process of production is to comprehend a phantom tre de raison When we speak of labour or 
capacity for labour we speak at the same time of the labourer and his means of subsistence of 
labourer and wages When we speak of capacity for labour we do not speak of labour any 
more  than  when  we  speak  of capacity  for  digestion  we  speak  of  digestion The  latter  process 
requires something more than a good stomach When we speak of capacity for labour we do not 
abstract from the necessary means of subsistence On the contrary their value is expressed in its 
value If his capacity for labour remains unsold the labourer derives no benefit from it but rather 
he will feel it to be a cruel natureimposed necessity that this capacity has cost for its production a 
definite amount of the means of subsistence and that it will continue to do so for its reproduction 
He will then agree with Sismondi that capacity for labour  is nothing unless it is sold  
One  consequence  of  the  peculiar  nature  of  labourpower  as a  commodity  is  that  its usevalue 
does not on the conclusion of the contract between the buyer and seller immediately pass into 
the hands of the former Its value like that of every other commodity is already fixed before it 
goes into circulation since a definite quantity of social labour has been spent upon it but its use
value  consists  in  the  subsequent  exercise  of  its  force  The  alienation  of  labourpower  and  its 
actual appropriation by the buyer its employment as a usevalue are separated by an interval of 
time But in those cases in which the formal alienation by sale of the usevalue of a commodity is 
not simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer the money of the latter usually functions as 
means of payment In every country in which the capitalist mode of production reigns it is the 
custom  not  to  pay  for  labourpower  before  it  has  been  exercised  for  the  period  fixed  by  the 
contract as for example the end of each week In all cases therefore the usevalue of the labour
power is advanced to the capitalist the labourer allows the buyer to consume it before he receives 
payment  of  the  price  he  everywhere  gives  credit  to  the  capitalist  That  this  credit  is  no  mere 
fiction is shown not only by the occasional loss of wages on the bankruptcy of the capitalist 
but also by a series of more enduring consequences Nevertheless whether money serves as a 
means  of  purchase  or  as  a  means  of  payment  this  makes  no  alteration  in  the  nature  of  the 
exchange of commodities The price of the labourpower is fixed by the contract although it is 
not realised till later like the rent of a house The labourpower is sold although it is only paid 
for at a later period It will therefore be useful for a clear comprehension of the relation of the 
parties to assume provisionally that the possessor of labourpower on the occasion of each sale 
immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it  

 

 

Chapter  
 
We now know how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of this peculiar commodity 
labourpower is determined The usevalue which the former gets in exchange manifests itself 
only in the actual utilisation in the consumption of the labourpower The moneyowner buys 
everything necessary for this purpose such as raw material in the market and pays for it at its 
full  value  The  consumption  of  labourpower  is  at  one  and  the  same  time  the  production  of 
commodities and of surplusvalue The consumption of labourpower is completed as in the case 
of  every  other  commodity  outside  the  limits  of  the  market  or  of  the  sphere  of  circulation 
Accompanied by Mr Moneybags and by the possessor of labourpower we therefore take leave 
for a time of this noisy sphere where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all 
men and follow them both into the hidden abode of production on whose threshold there stares 
us  in  the  face  No  admittance  except  on  business  Here  we  shall  see  not  only  how  capital 
produces but how capital is produced We shall at last force the secret of profit making  
This sphere that we are deserting within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of labourpower 
goes on is in fact a very Eden of the innate rights of man There alone rule Freedom Equality 
Property and Bentham Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity say of labour
power  are  constrained  only  by  their  own  free  will  They  contract  as  free  agents  and  the 
agreement they come to is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will 
Equality because each enters into relation with the other as with a simple owner of commodities 
and they exchange equivalent for equivalent Property because each disposes only of what is his 
own And Bentham because each looks only to himself The only force that brings them together 
and puts them in relation with each other is the selfishness the gain and the private interests of 
each Each looks to himself only and no one troubles himself about the rest and just because 
they do so do they all in accordance with the preestablished harmony of things or under the 
auspices of an allshrewd providence work together to their mutual advantage for the common 
weal and in the interest of all  
On leaving this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities which furnishes the 
Freetrader  Vulgaris  with  his  views  and  ideas  and  with  the  standard  by  which  he  judges  a 
society based on capital and wages we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our 
dramatis personae He who before was the moneyowner now strides in front as capitalist the 
possessor of labourpower follows as his labourer The one with an air of importance smirking 
intent on business the other timid and holding back like one who is bringing his own hide to 
market and has nothing to expect but  a hiding

 In encyclopaedias of classical antiquities we find such nonsense as this  that in the ancient world

Mommsen also in his History of Rome commits in this respect one blunder after another 
 Hence legislation in various countries fixes a maximum for labourcontracts Wherever free labour is 
the rule the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract In some States particularly in Mexico 
before the American Civil War also in the territories taken from Mexico and also as a matter of 
fact in the Danubian provinces till the revolution effected by Kusa slavery is hidden under the form 
of peonage By means of advances repayable in labour which are handed down from generation to 
generation not only the individual labourer but his family become de facto the property of other

of Producing SurplusValue 

Section  The LabourProcess or the Production of UseValues 
The capitalist buys labourpower in order to use it and labourpower in use is labour itself The 
purchaser of labourpower consumes it by setting the seller of it to work By working the latter 
becomes  actually  what  before  he  only  was  potentially  labourpower  in  action  a  labourer  In 
order  that  his  labour  may  reappear  in  a  commodity  he  must  before  all  things  expend  it  on 
something  useful  on  something  capable  of  satisfying  a  want  of  some  sort  Hence  what  the 
capitalist sets the labourer to produce is a particular usevalue a specified article The fact that 
the production of usevalues or goods is carried on under the control of a capitalist and on his 
behalf  does  not  alter  the general character of  that production  We shall therefore in  the  first 
place have to consider the labourprocess independently of the particular form it assumes under 
given social conditions  
Labour is in the first place a process in which both man and Nature participate and in which 
man of his own accord starts regulates and controls the material reactions between himself and 
Nature He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces setting in motion arms and legs 
head and hands the natural forces of his body in order to appropriate Natures productions in a 
form adapted to his own wants By thus acting on the external world and changing it he at the 
same time changes his own nature He develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act 
in obedience to his sway We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour 
that remind us of the mere animal An immeasurable interval of time separates the state of things 
in which a man brings his labourpower to market for sale as a commodity from that state in 
which human labour was still in its first instinctive stage We presuppose labour in a form that 
stamps it as exclusively human A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver 
and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells But what distinguishes 
the  worst  architect  from  the  best  of  bees  is  this  that  the  architect  raises  his  structure  in 
imagination before he erects it in reality At the end of every labourprocess we get a result that 
already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement He not only effects a 
change of form in the material on which he works but he also realises a purpose of his own that 
gives  the  law  to  his  modus  operandi  and  to  which  he  must  subordinate  his  will  And  this 
subordination is no mere momentary act Besides the exertion of the bodily organs the process 
demands that during the whole operation the workmans will be steadily in consonance with his 
purpose This means close attention The less he is attracted by the nature of the work and the 
mode in which it is carried on and the less therefore he enjoys it as something which gives play 
to his bodily and mental powers the more close his attention is forced to be  
The elementary factors of the labourprocess are  the personal activity of man ie work itself 
 the subject of that work and  its instruments  
The soil and this economically speaking includes water in the virgin state in which it supplies  
man with necessaries or the means of subsistence ready to hand exists independently of him and 
is the universal subject of human labour All those things which labour merely separates from 
immediate connexion with their environment are subjects of labour spontaneously provided by 
Nature Such are fish which we catch and take from their element water timber which we fell in 
the virgin forest and ores which we extract from their veins If on the other hand the subject of 
labour has so to say been filtered through previous labour we call it raw material such is ore 

 

 

Chapter  
 
already extracted and ready for washing All raw material is the subject of labour but not every 
subject of labour is raw material it can only become so after it has undergone some alteration by 
means of labour  
An instrument of labour is a thing or a complex of things which the labourer interposes between 
himself and the subject of his labour and which serves as the conductor of his activity He makes 
use of the mechanical physical and chemical properties of some substances in order to make 
other substances subservient to his aims Leaving out of consideration such readymade means 
of subsistence as fruits in gathering which a mans own limbs serve as the instruments of his 
labour the first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its 
instrument Thus Nature becomes one of the organs of his activity one that he annexes to his own 
bodily organs adding stature to himself in spite of the Bible As the earth is his original larder so 
too it is his original tool house It supplies him for instance with stones for throwing grinding 
pressing  cutting  c  The  earth  itself  is  an  instrument  of  labour  but  when  used  as  such  in 
agriculture implies a whole series of other instruments and a comparatively high development of 
labour No sooner does labour undergo the least development than it requires specially prepared 
instruments  Thus  in  the  oldest  caves  we  find  stone  implements  and  weapons  In  the  earliest 
period  of  human  history  domesticated  animals  ie  animals  which  have  been  bred  for  the 
purpose and have undergone modifications by means of labour play the chief part as instruments 
of labour along with specially prepared stones wood bones and shells The use and fabrication 
of  instruments  of  labour  although  existing  in  the  germ  among  certain  species  of  animals  is 
specifically characteristic of the human labourprocess and Franklin therefore defines man as a 
toolmaking animal Relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the 
investigation of extinct economic forms of society as do fossil bones for the determination of 
extinct  species  of  animals  It  is  not  the  articles  made  but  how  they  are  made  and  by  what 
instruments that enables us to distinguish different economic epochs  Instruments of labour not 
only supply a standard of the degree of development to which human labour has attained but they 
are  also  indicators  of  the  social  conditions  under  which  that  labour  is  carried  on  Among  the 
instruments of labour those of a mechanical nature which taken as a whole we may call the 
bone  and  muscles of  production  offer  much  more  decided  characteristics  of a  given  epoch  of 
production than those which like pipes tubs baskets jars c serve only to hold the materials 
for labour which latter class we may in a general way call the vascular system of production 
The latter first begins to play an important part in the chemical industries  
In a wider sense we may include among the instruments of labour in addition to those things that 
are used for directly transferring labour to its subject and which therefore in one way or another 
serve  as  conductors  of  activity  all  such  objects  as  are  necessary  for  carrying  on  the  labour
process These do not enter directly into the process but without them it is either impossible for it 
to  take  place  at  all  or  possible  only  to  a  partial  extent  Once  more  we  find  the  earth  to  be  a 
universal  instrument  of  this  sort  for  it  furnishes  a  locus  standi  to  the  labourer  and  a  field  of 
employment for his activity Among instruments that are the result of previous labour and also 
belong to this class we find workshops canals roads and so forth  
In the labourprocess therefore mans activity with the help of the instruments of labour effects 
an  alteration  designed  from  the  commencement  in  the  material  worked  upon  The  process 
disappears in the product the latter is a usevalue Natures material adapted by a change of form 
to the wants of man Labour has incorporated itself with its subject the former is materialised the 
latter transformed That which in the labourer appeared as movement now appears in the product 
as a fixed quality without motion The blacksmith forges and the product is a forging  

 

 

Chapter  
 
If we examine the whole process from the point of view of its result the product it is plain that 
both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of production and that the labour itself 
is productive labour  
Though  a  usevalue  in  the  form  of  a  product  issues  from  the  labourprocess  yet  other  use
values products of previous labour enter into it as means of production The same usevalue is 
both the product of a previous process and a means of production in a later process Products are 
therefore not only results but also essential conditions of labour  
With  the  exception  of  the  extractive  industries  in  which  the  material  for  labour  is  provided 
immediately by Nature such as mining hunting fishing and agriculture so far as the latter is 
confined to  breaking  up  virgin  soil all  branches  of industry  manipulate raw material  objects 
already filtered through labour already products of labour Such is seed in agriculture Animals 
and plants which we are accustomed to consider as products of Nature are in their present form 
not only products of say last years labour but the result of a gradual transformation continued 
through many generations under mans superintendence and by means of his labour But in the 
great majority of cases instruments of labour show even to the most superficial observer traces 
of the labour of past ages  
Raw  material  may  either  form  the  principal  substance  of  a  product  or  it  may  enter  into  its 
formation only as an accessory An accessory may be consumed by the instruments of labour as 
coal under a boiler oil by a wheel hay by drafthorses or it may be mixed with the raw material 
in order to produce some modification thereof as chlorine into unbleached linen coal with iron 
dyestuff  with  wool  or  again  it  may  help  to  carry  on  the  work  itself  as  in  the  case  of  the 
materials used for heating and lighting workshops The distinction between principal substance 
and accessory vanishes in the true chemical industries because there none of the raw material re
appears in its original composition in the substance of the product  
Every object possesses various properties and is thus capable of being applied to different uses 
One and the same product may therefore serve as raw material in very different processes Corn 
for example is a raw material for millers starchmanufacturers distillers and cattlebreeders It 
also enters as raw material into its own production in the shape of seed coal too is at the same 
time the product of and a means of production in coalmining  
Again a particular product may be used in one and the same process both as an instrument of 
labour and as raw material Take for instance the fattening of cattle where the animal is the raw 
material and at the same time an instrument for the production of manure  
A product though ready for immediate consumption may yet serve as raw material for a further 
product as grapes when they become the raw material for wine On the other hand labour may 
give us its product in such a form that we can use it only as raw material as is the case with 
cotton thread and yarn Such a raw material though itself a product may have to go through a 
whole series of different processes in each of these in turn it serves with constantly varying 
form as raw material until the last process of the series leaves it a perfect product ready for 
individual consumption or for use as an instrument of labour  
Hence we see that whether a usevalue is to be regarded as raw material as instrument of labour 
or as product this is determined entirely by its function in the labourprocess by the position it 
there occupies as this varies so does its character  
Whenever  therefore  a  product  enters  as  a  means  of  production  into  a  new  labourprocess  it 
thereby loses its character of product and becomes a mere factor in the process A spinner treats 
spindles only as implements for spinning and flax only as the material that he spins Of course it 
is impossible to spin without material and spindles and therefore the existence of these things as 

 

 

Chapter  
 
products at the commencement of the spinning operation must be presumed but in the process 
itself the fact that they are products of previous labour is a matter of utter indifference just as in 
the digestive process it is of no importance whatever that bread is the produce of the previous 
labour  of  the  farmer  the  miller  and  the  baker  On  the  contrary  it  is  generally  by  their 
imperfections as products that the means of production in any process assert themselves in their 
character of products A blunt knife or weak thread forcibly remind us of Mr A the cutler or 
Mr B the spinner In the finished product the labour by means of which it has acquired its useful 
qualities is not palpable has apparently vanished  
A machine which does not serve the purposes of labour is useless In addition it falls a prey to 
the destructive influence of natural forces Iron rusts and wood rots Yarn with which we neither 
weave nor knit is cotton wasted Living labour must seize upon these things and rouse them from 
their deathsleep change them from mere possible usevalues into real and effective ones Bathed 
in the fire of labour appropriated as part and parcel of labours organism and as it were made 
alive  for  the  performance  of  their  functions  in  the  process  they  are  in  truth  consumed  but 
consumed with a purpose as elementary constituents of new usevalues of new products ever 
ready as means of subsistence for individual consumption or as means of production for some 
new labourprocess  
If then on the one hand finished products are not only results but also necessary conditions of 
the labourprocess on the other hand their assumption into that process their contact with living 
labour is the sole means by which they can be made to retain their character of usevalues and be 
utilised  
Labour  uses  up  its  material  factors  its  subject  and  its  instruments  consumes  them  and  is 
therefore  a  process  of  consumption  Such  productive  consumption  is  distinguished  from 
individual consumption by this that the latter uses up products as means of subsistence for the 
living  individual  the  former  as  means  whereby  alone  labour  the  labourpower  of  the  living 
individual is enabled to act The product therefore of individual consumption is the consumer 
himself the result of productive consumption is a product distinct from the consumer  
In so far then as its instruments and subjects are themselves products labour consumes products 
in order to create products or in other words consumes one set of products by turning them into 
means of production for another set But just as in the beginning the only participators in the 
labourprocess were man and the earth which latter exists independently of man so even now we 
still employ in the process many means of production provided directly by Nature that do not 
represent any combination of natural substances with human labour  
The labourprocess resolved as above into its simple elementary factors is human action with a 
view to the production of usevalues appropriation of natural substances to human requirements 
it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and Nature it is the 
everlasting Natureimposed condition of human existence and therefore is independent of every 
social phase of that existence or rather is common to every such phase It was therefore not 
necessary to represent our labourer in connexion with other labourers man and his labour on one 
side Nature and its materials on the other sufficed As the taste of the porridge does not tell you 
who  grew  the  oats  no  more  does  this  simple  process  tell  you  of  itself  what  are  the  social 
conditions  under  which  it  is  taking  place  whether  under  the  slaveowners  brutal  lash  or  the 
anxious  eye  of  the  capitalist  whether  Cincinnatus carries it on in  tilling  his  modest  farm  or  a 
savage in killing wild animals with stones  
Let us now return to our wouldbe capitalist We left him just after he had purchased in the open 
market  all  the  necessary  factors  of  the  labour  process  its  objective  factors  the  means  of 
production as well as its subjective factor labourpower With the keen eye of an expert he has 
 

 

Chapter  
 
selected  the  means  of  production  and  the  kind  of  labourpower  best  adapted  to  his  particular 
trade  be  it  spinning  bootmaking  or  any  other  kind  He  then  proceeds  to  consume  the 
commodity the labourpower that he has just bought by causing the labourer the impersonation 
of that labourpower to consume the means of production by his labour The general character of 
the labourprocess is evidently not changed by the fact that the labourer works for the capitalist 
instead of for himself moreover the particular methods and operations employed in bootmaking 
or spinning are not immediately changed by the intervention of the capitalist He must begin by 
taking the labourpower as he finds it in the market and consequently be satisfied with labour of 
such  a  kind  as  would  be  found  in  the  period  immediately  preceding  the  rise  of  capitalists 
Changes in the methods of production by the subordination of labour to capital can take place 
only at a later period and therefore will have to be treated of in a later chapter  
The  labourprocess  turned  into  the  process  by  which  the  capitalist  consumes  labourpower 
exhibits two characteristic phenomena First the labourer works under the control of the capitalist 
to  whom  his  labour belongs  the  capitalist taking  good  care  that the  work  is  done  in a  proper 
manner  and  that  the  means  of  production  are  used  with  intelligence  so  that  there  is  no 
unnecessary  waste  of  raw  material  and  no  wear  and  tear  of  the  implements  beyond  what  is 
necessarily caused by the work  
Secondly the product is the property of the capitalist and not that of the labourer its immediate 
producer Suppose that a capitalist pays for a days labourpower at its value then the right to use 
that power for a day belongs to him just as much as the right to use any other commodity such as 
a horse that he has hired for the day To the purchaser of a commodity belongs its use and the 
seller of labourpower by giving his labour does no more in reality than part with the usevalue 
that he has sold From the instant he steps into the workshop the usevalue of his labourpower 
and therefore also its use which is labour belongs to the capitalist By the purchase of labour
power the capitalist incorporates labour as a living ferment with the lifeless constituents of the 
product From his point of view the labourprocess is nothing more than the consumption of the 
commodity purchased i e of labourpower but this consumption cannot be effected except by 
supplying  the  labourpower  with  the  means  of  production  The  labourprocess  is  a  process 
between  things  that  the  capitalist  has  purchased  things  that  have  become  his  property  The 
product of this process belongs therefore to him just as much as does the wine which is the 
product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar  

Section  The Production of SurplusValue 

The  product  appropriated  by  the  capitalist  is  a  usevalue  as  yarn  for  example  or  boots  But 
although boots are in one sense the basis of all social progress and our capitalist is a decided 
progressist yet he does not manufacture boots for their own sake Usevalue is by no means 
the  thing  quon  aime  pour  luimme  in  the  production  of  commodities  Usevalues  are  only 
produced  by  capitalists  because  and  in  so  far  as  they  are  the  material  substratum  the 
depositories of exchangevalue Our capitalist has two objects in view in the first place he wants 
to produce a usevalue that has a value in exchange that is to say an article destined to be sold a 
commodity and secondly he desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than 
the  sum  of  the  values  of  the  commodities  used  in  its  production  that  is  of  the  means  of 
production and the labourpower that he purchased with his good money in the open market His 
aim is to produce not only a usevalue but a commodity also not only usevalue but value not 
only value but at the same time surplusvalue  
It must be borne in mind that we are now dealing with the production of commodities and that 
up to this point we have only considered one aspect of the process Just as commodities are at 
 

 

Chapter  
 
the same time usevalues and values so the process of producing them must be a labourprocess 
and at the same time a process of creating value  
Let us now examine production as a creation of value  
We know that the value of each commodity is determined by the quantity of labour expended on 
and  materialised  in  it  by  the  workingtime  necessary  under  given  social  conditions  for  its 
production This rule also holds good in the case of the product that accrued to our capitalist as 
the result of the labourprocess carried on for him Assuming this product to be  lbs of yarn 
our first step is to calculate the quantity of labour realised in it  
For spinning the yarn raw material is required suppose in this case  lbs of cotton We have no 
need  at  present  to  investigate  the  value  of  this  cotton  for  our  capitalist  has  we  will  assume 
bought it at its full value say of ten shillings In this price the labour required for the production 
of  the  cotton  is  already  expressed  in  terms  of  the  average  labour  of  society  We  will  further 
assume that the wear and tear of the spindle which for our present purpose may represent all 
other instruments of labour employed amounts to the value of s If then twentyfour hours 
labour or two working days are required to produce the quantity of gold represented by twelve 
shillings we have here to begin with two days labour already incorporated in the yarn  
We must not let ourselves be misled by the circumstance that the cotton has taken a new shape 
while the substance of the spindle has to a certain extent been used up By the general law of 
value  if  the  value  of    lbs  of  yarn    the  value  of    lbs  of  cotton    the  value  of  a  whole 
spindle i e if the same workingtime is required to produce the commodities on either side of 
this equation then  lbs of yarn are an equivalent for  lbs of cotton together with onefourth 
of a spindle In the case we are considering the same workingtime is materialised in the  lbs of 
yarn  on  the  one  hand  and  in  the    lbs  of  cotton  and  the  fraction  of  a  spindle  on  the  other 
Therefore whether value appears in cotton in a spindle or in yarn makes no difference in the 
amount of that value The spindle and cotton instead of resting quietly side by side join together 
in the process their forms are altered and they are turned into yarn but their value is no more 
affected by this fact than it would be if they had been simply exchanged for their equivalent in 
yarn  
The labour required for the production of the cotton the raw material of the yarn is part of the 
labour necessary to produce the yarn and is therefore contained in the yarn The same applies to 
the labour embodied in the spindle without whose wear and tear the cotton could not be spun  
Hence in determining the value of the yarn or the labourtime required for its production all the 
special processes carried on at various times and in different places which were necessary first 
to produce the cotton and the wasted portion of the spindle and then with the cotton and spindle 
to spin the yarn may together be looked on as different and successive phases of one and the 
same  process  The  whole  of  the  labour  in  the  yarn  is  past  labour  and  it  is  a  matter  of  no 
importance  that  the  operations  necessary  for  the  production  of  its  constituent  elements  were 
carried on at times which referred to the present are more remote than the final operation of 
spinning If a definite quantity of labour say thirty days is requisite to build a house the total 
amount of labour incorporated in it is not altered by the fact that the work of the last day is done 
twentynine days later than that of the first Therefore the labour contained in the raw material 
and the instruments of labour can be treated just as if it were labour expended in an earlier stage 
of the spinning process before the labour of actual spinning commenced  
The  values  of  the  means  of  production  i  e  the  cotton  and  the  spindle  which  values  are 
expressed in the price of twelve shillings are therefore constituent parts of the value of the yarn 
or in other words of the value of the product  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Two conditions must nevertheless be fulfilled First the cotton and spindle must concur in the 
production of a usevalue they must in the present case become yarn Value is independent of the 
particular usevalue by which it is borne but it must be embodied in a usevalue of some kind 
Secondly the time occupied in the labour of production must not exceed the time really necessary 
under  the  given  social  conditions  of  the  case  Therefore  if  no  more  than    lb  of  cotton  be 
requisite  to  spin    lb  of  yarn  care  must  be  taken  that  no  more  than  this  weight  of  cotton  is 
consumed in the production of  lb of yarn and similarly with regard to the spindle Though the 
capitalist have a hobby and use a gold instead of a steel spindle yet the only labour that counts 
for anything in the value of the yarn is that which would be required to produce a steel spindle 
because no more is necessary under the given social conditions  
We now know what portion of the value of the yarn is owing to the cotton and the spindle It 
amounts to twelve shillings or the value of two days work The next point for our consideration 
is what portion of the value of the yarn is added to the cotton by the labour of the spinner  
We have now to consider this labour under a very different aspect from that which it had during 
the  labourprocess  there  we  viewed  it  solely  as  that  particular  kind  of  human  activity  which 
changes cotton into yarn there the more the labour was suited to the work the better the yarn 
other  circumstances  remaining  the  same  The  labour  of  the  spinner  was  then  viewed  as 
specifically  different  from  other  kinds  of  productive  labour  different  on  the  one  hand  in  its 
special aim viz spinning different on the other hand in the special character of its operations 
in the special nature of its means of production and in the special usevalue of its product For the 
operation  of  spinning  cotton  and  spindles  are  a  necessity  but  for  making  rifled  cannon  they 
would be of no use whatever Here on the contrary where we consider the labour of the spinner 
only so far as it is valuecreating ie a source of value his labour differs in no respect from the 
labour of the man who bores cannon or what here more nearly concerns us from the labour of 
the  cottonplanter  and  spindlemaker  incorporated  in  the  means  of  production  It  is  solely  by 
reason of this identity that cotton planting spindle making and spinning are capable of forming 
the  component  parts  differing  only  quantitatively  from  each  other  of  one  whole  namely  the 
value of the yarn Here we have nothing more to do with the quality the nature and the specific 
character of the labour but merely with its quantity And this simply requires to be calculated 
We proceed upon the assumption that spinning is simple unskilled labour the average labour of a 
given  state  of  society  Hereafter  we  shall  see  that  the  contrary  assumption  would  make  no 
difference  
While  the  labourer  is  at  work  his  labour  constantly  undergoes  a  transformation  from  being 
motion it becomes an object without motion from being the labourer working it becomes the 
thing produced At the end of one hours spinning that act is represented by a definite quantity of 
yarn in other words a definite quantity of labour namely that of one hour has become embodied 
in  the  cotton  We  say  labour  ie  the  expenditure  of  his  vital  force  by  the  spinner  and  not 
spinning  labour  because  the  special  work  of  spinning  counts  here  only  so  far  as  it  is  the 
expenditure of labourpower in general and not in so far as it is the specific work of the spinner  
In  the  process  we  are  now  considering  it  is  of  extreme  importance  that  no  more  time  be 
consumed  in  the  work  of  transforming  the  cotton  into  yarn  than  is  necessary  under  the  given 
social  conditions  If  under  normal  ie  average  social  conditions  of  production  a  pounds  of 
cotton ought to be made into b pounds of yarn by one hours labour then a days labour does not 
count as  hours labour unless  a pounds of cotton have been made into  b pounds of yarn 
for in the creation of value the time that is socially necessary alone counts  
Not only the labour but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light 
very different from that in which we viewed them in the labourprocess pure and simple The raw 
 

 

Chapter  
 
material serves now merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labour By this absorption it 
is in fact changed into yarn because it is spun because labourpower in the form of spinning is 
added to it but the product the yarn is now nothing more than a measure of the labour absorbed 
by the cotton If in one hour   lbs of cotton can be spun into   lbs of yarn then  lbs of 
yarn indicate the absorption of  hours labour Definite quantities of product these quantities 
being determined by experience now represent nothing but definite quantities of labour definite 
masses of crystallised labourtime They are nothing more than the materialisation of so many 
hours or so many days of social labour  
We are here no more concerned about the facts that the labour is the specific work of spinning 
that its subject is cotton and its product yarn than we are about the fact that the subject itself is 
already a product and therefore raw material If the spinner instead of spinning were working in 
a  coal  mine  the  subject  of  his  labour  the  coal  would  be  supplied  by  Nature  nevertheless  a 
definite  quantity  of  extracted  coal  a  hundredweight  for  example  would  represent  a  definite 
quantity of absorbed labour  
We assumed on the occasion of its sale that the value of a days labourpower is three shillings 
and that six hours labour is incorporated in that sum and consequently that this amount of labour 
is requisite to produce the necessaries of life daily required on an average by the labourer If now 
our spinner by working for one hour can convert   lbs of cotton into   lbs of yarn  it 
follows that in six hours he will convert  lbs of cotton into  lbs of yarn Hence during the 
spinning  process  the  cotton  absorbs  six  hours  labour  The  same  quantity  of  labour  is  also 
embodied in a piece of gold of the value of three shillings Consequently by the mere labour of 
spinning a value of three shillings is added to the cotton  
Let  us  now consider  the  total  value  of the  product the   lbs  of  yarn Two  and  a  half  days 
labour  has  been  embodied  in  it  of  which  two  days  were  contained  in  the  cotton  and  in  the 
substance of the spindle worn away and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning 
This two and a half days labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen 
shillings Hence fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the  lbs of yarn or the price of one 
pound is eighteenpence  
Our capitalist stares in astonishment The value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the 
capital advanced The value so advanced has not expanded no surplusvalue has been created 
and  consequently  money  has  not  been  converted  into  capital  The  price  of  the  yarn  is  fifteen 
shillings and fifteen shillings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the 
product or what amounts to the same thing upon the factors of the labourprocess ten shillings 
were  paid  for  the  cotton  two  shillings  for  the  substance  of  the  spindle  worn  away  and  three 
shillings for the labourpower The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail for it is merely the 
sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton the spindle and the labourpower out of such a 
simple addition of existing values no surplusvalue can possibly arise These separate values 
are now all concentrated in one thing but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings before 
it was split up into three parts by the purchase of the commodities  
There  is  in  reality  nothing  very  strange  in  this  result  The  value  of  one  pound  of  yarn  being 
eighteenpence if our capitalist buys  lbs of yarn in the market he must pay fifteen shillings for 
them It is clear that whether a man buys his house ready built or gets it built for him in neither 
case will the mode of acquisition increase the amount of money laid out on the house  
Our capitalist who is at home in his vulgar economy exclaims Oh but I advanced my money 
for the express purpose of making more money The way to Hell is paved with good intentions 
and he might just as easily have intended to make money without producing at all He threatens 
all sorts of things He wont be caught napping again In future he will buy the commodities in the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
market instead of manufacturing them himself But if all his brother capitalists were to do the 
same where would he find his commodities in the market And his money he cannot eat He tries 
persuasion Consider my abstinence I might have played ducks and drakes with the  shillings 
but instead of that I consumed it productively and made yarn with it Very well and by way of 
reward he is now in possession of good yarn instead of a bad conscience and as for playing the 
part of a miser it would never do for him to relapse into such bad ways as that we have seen 
before  to  what  results  such  asceticism  leads  Besides  where  nothing  is  the  king  has  lost  his 
rights  whatever  may  be  the  merit  of  his  abstinence  there  is  nothing  wherewith  specially  to 
remunerate  it  because  the  value  of  the  product  is  merely  the  sum  of  the  values  of  the 
commodities that were thrown into the process of production Let him therefore console himself 
with the reflection that virtue is its own reward But no he becomes importunate He says The 
yarn is of no use to me I produced it for sale In that case let him sell it or still better let him 
for the future produce only things for satisfying his personal wants a remedy that his physician 
MacCulloch has already prescribed as infallible against an epidemic of overproduction He now 
gets obstinate Can the labourer he asks merely with his arms and legs produce commodities 
out of nothing Did I not supply him with the materials by means of which and in which alone 
his labour could be embodied And as the greater part of society consists of such neerdowells 
have I not rendered society incalculable service by my instruments of production my cotton and 
my spindle and not only society but the labourer also whom in addition I have provided with the 
necessaries of life And am I to be allowed nothing in return for all this service Well but has 
not the labourer rendered him the equivalent service of changing his cotton and spindle into yarn 
Moreover there is here no question of service A service is nothing more than the useful effect 
of a usevalue be it of a commodity or be it of labour But here we are dealing with exchange
value The capitalist paid to the labourer a value of  shillings and the labourer gave him back an 
exact equivalent in the value of  shillings added by him to the cotton he gave him value for 
value Our friend up to this time so purseproud suddenly assumes the modest demeanour of his 
own workman and exclaims Have I myself not worked Have I not performed the labour of 
superintendence and of overlooking the spinner And does not this labour too create value His 
overlooker  and  his  manager  try  to  hide  their  smiles  Meanwhile  after  a  hearty  laugh  he  re
assumes his usual mien Though he chanted to us the whole creed of the economists in reality he 
says he would not give a brass farthing for it He leaves this and all such like subterfuges and 
juggling  tricks  to  the  professors  of  Political  Economy  who  are  paid  for  it  He  himself  is  a 
practical man and though he does not always consider what he says outside his business yet in 
his business he knows what he is about  
Let  us  examine  the  matter  more  closely  The  value  of  a  days  labourpower  amounts  to   
shillings because on our assumption half a days labour is embodied in that quantity of labour
power ie because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour
power cost half a days labour But the past labour that is embodied in the labourpower and the 
living labour that it can call into action the daily cost of maintaining it and its daily expenditure 
in work are two totally different things The former determines the exchangevalue of the labour
power the latter is its usevalue The fact that half a days labour is necessary to keep the labourer 
alive during  hours does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day Therefore the 
value of labourpower and the value which that labourpower creates in the labourprocess are 
two entirely different magnitudes and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist 
had in view when he was purchasing the labourpower The useful qualities that labourpower 
possesses  and  by  virtue  of  which  it  makes  yarn  or  boots  were  to  him  nothing  more  than  a 
conditio sine qua non for in order to create value labour must be expended in a useful manner 
What really influenced him was the specific usevalue which this commodity possesses of being a 
 

 

Chapter  
 
source not only of value but of more value than it has itself This is the special service that the 
capitalist  expects  from  labourpower  and  in  this  transaction  he  acts  in  accordance  with  the 
eternal laws of the exchange of commodities The seller of labourpower like the seller of any 
other commodity realises its exchangevalue and parts with its usevalue He cannot take the one 
without giving the other The usevalue of labourpower or in other words labour belongs just 
as little to its seller as the usevalue of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has 
sold it The owner of the money has paid the value of a days labourpower his therefore is the 
use of it for a day a days labour belongs to him The circumstance that on the one hand the 
daily sustenance of labourpower costs only half a days labour while on the other hand the very 
same  labourpower  can  work  during  a  whole  day  that  consequently  the  value  which  its  use 
during one day creates is double what he pays for that use this circumstance is without doubt a 
piece of good luck for the buyer but by no means an injury to the seller  
Our capitalist foresaw this state of things and that was the cause of his laughter The labourer 
therefore finds in the workshop the means of production necessary for working not only during 
six but during twelve hours Just as during the six hours process our  lbs of cotton absorbed 
six hours labour and became  lbs of yarn so now  lbs of cotton will absorb  hours 
labour and be changed into  lbs of yarn Let us now examine the product of this prolonged 
process There is now materialised in this  lbs of yarn the labour of five days of which four 
days  are  due  to  the  cotton  and  the  lost  steel  of  the  spindle  the  remaining  day  having  been 
absorbed by the cotton during the spinning process Expressed in gold the labour of five days is 
thirty shillings This is therefore the price of the  lbs of yarn giving as before eighteenpence 
as the price of a pound But the sum of the values of the commodities that entered into the process 
amounts to  shillings The value of the yarn is  shillings Therefore the value of the product is 
 greater than the value advanced for its production  shillings have been transformed into  
shillings a surplusvalue of  shillings has been created The trick has at last succeeded money 
has been converted into capital  
Every  condition  of  the  problem  is  satisfied  while  the  laws  that  regulate  the  exchange  of 
commodities have been in no way violated Equivalent has been exchanged for equivalent For 
the capitalist as buyer paid for each commodity for the cotton the spindle and the labourpower 
its full value He then did what is done by every purchaser of commodities he consumed their 
usevalue  The  consumption  of  the  labourpower  which  was  also  the  process  of  producing 
commodities resulted in  lbs of yarn having a value of  shillings The capitalist formerly a 
buyer now returns to market as a seller of commodities He sells his yarn at eighteenpence a 
pound which is its exact value Yet for all that he withdraws  shillings more from circulation 
than he originally threw into it This metamorphosis this conversion of money into capital takes 
place  both  within  the  sphere  of  circulation  and  also  outside  it  within  the  circulation  because 
conditioned by the purchase of the labourpower in the market outside the circulation because 
what is done within it is only a steppingstone to the production of surplusvalue a process which 
is entirely confined to the sphere of production Thus tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des 
mondes possibles Everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds  Voltaire 
Candide  
By turning his money into commodities that serve as the material elements of a new product and 
as  factors  in  the  labourprocess  by  incorporating  living  labour  with  their  dead  substance  the 
capitalist at the same time converts value ie past materialised and dead labour into capital 
into value big with value a live monster that is fruitful and multiplies  
If we now compare the two processes of producing value and of creating surplusvalue we see 
that the latter is nothing but the continuation of the former beyond a definite point If on the one 

 

 

Chapter  
 
hand the process be not carried beyond the point where the value paid by the capitalist for the 
labourpower is replaced by an exact equivalent it is simply a process of producing value if on 
the other hand it be continued beyond that point it becomes a process of creating surplusvalue  
If we proceed further and compare the process of producing value with the labourprocess pure 
and  simple  we  find  that  the  latter  consists  of  the  useful  labour  the  work  that  produces  use
values  Here  we contemplate the labour as  producing  a  particular  article  we view  it  under  its 
qualitative aspect alone with regard to its end and aim But viewed as a valuecreating process 
the same labourprocess presents itself under its quantitative aspect alone Here it is a question 
merely of the time occupied by the labourer in doing the work of the period during which the 
labourpower is usefully expended Here the commodities that take part in the process do not 
count  any  longer as necessary  adjuncts  of  labourpower in the  production  of  a  definite  useful 
object  They  count  merely  as  depositories  of  so  much  absorbed  or  materialised  labour  that 
labour whether previously embodied in the means of production or incorporated in them for the 
first time during the process by the action of labourpower counts in either case only according to 
its duration it amounts to so many hours or days as the case may be  
Moreover only so much of the time spent in the production of any article is counted as under 
the given social conditions is necessary The consequences of this are various In the first place 
it becomes necessary that the labour should be carried on under normal conditions If a selfacting 
mule is the implement in general use for spinning it would be absurd to supply the spinner with a 
distaff and spinning wheel The cotton too must not be such rubbish as to cause extra waste in 
being worked but must be of suitable quality Otherwise the spinner would be found to spend 
more time in producing a pound of yarn than is socially necessary in which case the excess of 
time would create neither value nor money But whether the material factors of the process are of 
normal quality or not depends not upon the labourer but entirely upon the capitalist Then again 
the labourpower itself must be of average efficacy In the trade in which it is being employed it 
must possess the average skill handiness and quickness prevalent in that trade and our capitalist 
took good care to buy labourpower of such normal goodness This power must be applied with 
the  average  amount  of  exertion  and  with the usual  degree  of intensity  and  the  capitalist is  as 
careful to see that this is done as that his workmen are not idle for a single moment He has 
bought the use of the labourpower for a definite period and he insists upon his rights He has no 
intention of being robbed Lastly and for this purpose our friend has a penal code of his own all 
wasteful consumption of raw material or instruments of labour is strictly forbidden because what 
is so wasted represents labour superfluously expended labour that does not count in the product 
or enter into its value  
We  now  see  that  the  difference  between  labour  considered  on  the  one  hand  as  producing 
utilities  and  on  the  other  hand  as  creating  value  a  difference  which  we  discovered  by  our 
analysis of a commodity resolves itself into a distinction between two aspects of the process of 
production  
The process of production considered on the one hand as the unity of the labourprocess and the 
process of creating value is production of commodities considered on the other hand as the unity 
of the labourprocess and the process of producing surplusvalue it is the capitalist process of 
production or capitalist production of commodities  
We stated on a previous page that in the creation of surplusvalue it does not in the least matter 
whether the labour appropriated by the capitalist be simple unskilled labour of average quality or 
more  complicated  skilled  labour  All  labour  of  a  higher  or  more  complicated  character  than 
average  labour  is  expenditure  of  labourpower  of  a  more  costly  kind  labourpower  whose 
production has cost more time and labour and which therefore has a higher value than unskilled 
 

 

Chapter  
 
or  simple  labourpower  This  power  being  highervalue  its  consumption  is  labour  of  a  higher 
class labour that creates in equal times proportionally higher values than unskilled labour does 
Whatever difference in skill there may be between the labour of a spinner and that of a jeweller 
the  portion  of  his  labour  by  which  the  jeweller  merely  replaces  the  value  of  his  own  labour
power  does  not  in  any  way  differ  in  quality  from  the  additional  portion  by  which  he  creates 
surplusvalue In the making of jewellery just as in spinning the surplusvalue results only from 
a quantitative excess of labour from a lengtheningout of one and the same labourprocess in the 
one case of the process of making jewels in the other of the process of making yarn  
But  on  the  other  hand  in  every  process  of  creating  value  the  reduction  of  skilled  labour  to 
average  social  labour  eg  one  day  of  skilled  to  six  days  of  unskilled  labour  is  unavoidable 
We  therefore  save  ourselves  a  superfluous  operation  and  simplify  our  analysis  by  the 
assumption  that  the  labour  of  the  workman  employed  by  the  capitalist  is  unskilled  average 
labour

 This is one of the circumstances that makes production by slave labour such a costly process The

mutum But he himself takes care to let both beast and implement feel that he is none of them but is a

method of production only to employ the rudest and heaviest implements and such as are difficult to

encumbered  with  and  the  excessive  weight  and  clumsiness  of  which  I  would  judge  would  make 
work at least ten per cent greater than with those ordinarily used with us And I am assured that in the 
careless and clumsy way they must be used by the slaves anything lighter or less rude could not be 
furnished them with good economy and that such tools as we constantly give our labourers and find 
our profit in giving them would not last out a day in a Virginia cornfield  much lighter and more free 
from stones though it be than ours So too when I ask why mules are so universally substituted for 
horses  on  the  farm  the  first  reason  given  and  confessedly  the  most  conclusive  one  is  that  horses 
cannot bear the treatment that they always must get from negroes horses are always soon foundered 
or crippled by them while mules will bear cudgelling or lose a meal or two now and then and not be 
materially injured and they do not take cold or get sick if neglected or overworked But I do not need

 The distinction between skilled and unskilled labour rests in part on pure illusion or to say  the 
least  on  distinctions  that  have  long  since  ceased  to  be  real  and  that  survive  only  by  virtue  of  a 
traditional  convention  in  part  on  the  helpless  condition  of  some  groups  of  the  workingclass  a 
condition  that  prevents  them  from  exacting  equally  with  the  rest  the  value  of  their  labourpower 
Accidental circumstances here play so great a part that these two forms of labour sometimes change 
places  Where  for  instance  the  physique  of  the  workingclass  has  deteriorated  and  is  relatively 
speaking exhausted which is the case in all countries with a well developed capitalist production the 
lower  forms  of  labour  which  demand  great  expenditure  of  muscle  are  in  general  considered  as 
skilled  compared  with  much  more  delicate  forms  of  labour  the  latter  sink  down  to  the  level  of 
unskilled labour Take as an example the labour of a bricklayer which in England occupies a much 
higher  level  than  that  of  a  damaskweaver  Again  although  the  labour  of  a  fustian  cutter  demands 
great bodily exertion and is at the same time unhealthy yet it counts only as unskilled labour And 
then we must not forget that the socalled skilled labour does not occupy a large space in the field of 
national  labour  Laing  estimates  that  in  England  and  Wales  the  livelihood  of    people 
depends on unskilled labour If from the total population of  living at the time when he

Capital 

The various factors of the labourprocess play different parts in forming the value of the product 
The labourer adds fresh value to the subject of his labour by expending upon it a given amount of 
additional labour no matter what the specific character and utility of that labour may be On the 
other  hand  the  values  of  the  means  of  production  used  up  in  the  process  are  preserved  and 
present themselves afresh as constituent parts of the value of the product the values of the cotton 
and the spindle for instance reappear again in the value of the yarn The value of the means of 
production is therefore preserved by being transferred to the product This transfer takes place 
during the conversion of those means into a product or in other words during the labourprocess 
It is brought about by labour but how  
The labourer does not perform two operations at once one in order to add value to the cotton the 
other in order to preserve the value of the means of production or what amounts to the same 
thing to transfer to the yarn to the product the value of the cotton on which he works and part 
of the value of the spindle with which he works But by the very act of adding new value he 
preserves  their  former  values  Since  however  the  addition  of  new  value  to  the  subject  of  his 
labour  and  the  preservation  of  its  former  value  are  two  entirely  distinct  results  produced 
simultaneously by the labourer during one operation it is plain that this twofold nature of the 
result can be explained only by the twofold nature of his labour at one and the same time it 
must in one character create value and in another character preserve or transfer value  
Now  in  what  manner  does  every  labourer  add  new  labour  and  consequently  new  value 
Evidently only by labouring productively in a particular way the spinner by spinning the weaver 
by weaving the smith by forging But while thus incorporating labour generally that is value it 
is  by  the  particular  form  alone  of  the  labour  by  the  spinning  the  weaving  and  the  forging 
respectively that the means of production the cotton and spindle the yarn and loom and the iron 
and  anvil  become  constituent  elements  of  the  product  of  a  new  usevalue  Each  usevalue 
disappears but only to reappear under a new form in a new usevalue Now we saw when we 
were considering the process of creating value that if a usevalue be effectively consumed in the 
production of a new usevalue the quantity of labour expended in the production of the consumed 
article  forms  a  portion  of  the  quantity  of labour necessary  to  produce the  new  usevalue this 
portion is therefore labour transferred from the means of production to the new product Hence 
the  labourer  preserves  the  values  of  the  consumed  means  of  production  or  transfers  them  as 
portions of its value to the product not by virtue of his additional labour abstractedly considered 
but by virtue of the particular useful character of that labour by virtue of its special productive 
form  In  so  far  then  as  labour  is  such  specific  productive  activity  in  so  far  as  it  is  spinning 
weaving or forging it raises by mere contact the means of production from the dead makes 
them living factors of the labourprocess and combines with them to form the new products 
If  the  special  productive  labour  of  the  workman  were  not  spinning  he  could  not  convert  the 
cotton into yarn and therefore could not transfer the values of the cotton and spindle to the yarn 
Suppose the same workman were to change his occupation to that of a joiner he would still by a 
days  labour  add  value  to  the  material  he  works  upon  Consequently  we  see  first  that  the 
addition  of  new  value  takes  place  not  by  virtue  of  his  labour  being  spinning  in  particular  or 
joinering  in  particular  but  because  it is  labour  in the  abstract a  portion  of  the  total labour  of 
society  and  we  see  next  that  the  value  added  is  of  a  given  definite  amount  not  because  his 
 

 

Chapter  
 
labour has a special utility but because it is exerted for a definite time On the one hand then it 
is by virtue of its general character as being expenditure of human labourpower in the abstract 
that spinning adds new value to the values of the cotton and the spindle and on the other hand it 
is by virtue of its special character as being a concrete useful process that the same labour of 
spinning both transfers the values of the means of production to the product and preserves them 
in the product Hence at one and the same time there is produced a twofold result  
By the simple addition of a certain quantity of labour new value is added and by the quality of 
this added labour the original values of the means of production are preserved in the product 
This twofold effect resulting from the twofold character of labour may be traced in various 
phenomena  
Let us assume that some invention enables the spinner to spin as much cotton in  hours as he 
was able to spin before in  hours His labour is now six times as effective as it was for the 
purposes of useful production The product of  hours work has increased sixfold from  lbs to 
 lbs But now the  lbs of cotton absorb only the same amount of labour as formerly did the  
lbs Onesixth as much new labour is absorbed by each pound of cotton and consequently the 
value added by the labour to each pound is only onesixth of what it formerly was On the other 
hand in the product in the  lbs of yarn the value transferred from the cotton is six times as 
great as before By the  hours spinning the value of the raw material preserved and transferred 
to the product is six times as great as before although the new value added by the labour of the 
spinner  to  each  pound  of  the  very  same  raw  material  is  onesixth  what  it  was  formerly  This 
shows that the two properties of labour by virtue of which it is enabled in one case to preserve 
value and in the other to create value are essentially different On the one hand the longer the 
time necessary to spin a given weight of cotton into yarn the greater is the new value added to the 
material on the other hand the greater the weight of the cotton spun in a given time the greater 
is the value preserved by being transferred from it to the product  
Let us now assume that the productiveness of the spinners labour instead of varying remains 
constant that he therefore requires the same time as he formerly did to convert one pound of 
cotton into yarn but that the exchangevalue of the cotton varies either by rising to six times its 
former value or falling to onesixth of that value In both these cases the spinner puts the same 
quantity of labour into a pound of cotton and therefore adds as much value as he did before the 
change in the value he also produces a given weight of yarn in the same time as he did before 
Nevertheless the value that he transfers from the cotton to the yarn is either onesixth of what it 
was before the variation or as the case may be six times as much as before The same result 
occurs when the value of the instruments of labour rises or falls while their useful efficacy in the 
process remains unaltered  
Again if the technical conditions of the spinning process remain unchanged and no change of 
value takes place in the means of production the spinner continues to consume in equal working
times equal quantities of raw material and equal quantities of machinery of unvarying value The 
value that he preserves in the product is directly proportional to the new value that he adds to the 
product In two weeks he incorporates twice as much labour and therefore twice as much value 
as in one week and during the same time he consumes twice as much material and wears out 
twice as much machinery of double the value in each case he therefore preserves in the product 
of two weeks twice as much value as in the product of one week So long as the conditions of 
production remain the same the more value the labourer adds by fresh labour the more value he 
transfers and  preserves  but  he  does  so  merely  because  this  addition  of  new  value  takes  place 
under conditions that have not varied and are independent of his own labour Of course it may be 
said in one sense that the labourer preserves old value always in proportion to the quantity of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
new value that he adds Whether the value of cotton rise from one shilling to two shillings or fall 
to sixpence the workman invariably preserves in the product of one hour only one half as much 
value as he preserves in two hours In like manner if the productiveness of his own labour varies 
by rising or falling he will in one hour spin either more or less cotton as the case may be than he 
did  before  and  will  consequently  preserve  in  the  product  of  one  hour  more  or  less  value  of 
cotton but all the same he will preserve by two hours labour twice as much value as he will by 
one  
Value  exists  only  in  articles  of  utility  in  objects  we  leave  out  of  consideration  its  purely 
symbolical representation by tokens Man himself viewed as the impersonation of labourpower 
is a natural object a thing although a living conscious thing and labour is the manifestation of 
this  power  residing  in  him  If  therefore  an  article  loses  its  utility  it  also  loses  its  value  The 
reason why means of production do not lose their value at the same time that they lose their use
value is this they lose in the labourprocess the original form of their usevalue only to assume 
in the product the form of a new usevalue But however important it may be to value that it 
should have some object of utility to embody itself in yet it is a matter of complete indifference 
what particular object serves this purpose this we saw when treating of the metamorphosis of 
commodities Hence it follows that in the labourprocess the means of production transfer their 
value to the product only so far as along with their usevalue they lose also their exchangevalue 
They give up to the product that value alone which they themselves lose as means of production 
But in this respect the material factors of the labourprocess do not all behave alike  
The coal burnt under the boiler vanishes without leaving a trace so too the tallow with which 
the  axles  of  wheels  are  greased  Dye  stuffs  and  other  auxiliary  substances  also  vanish  but  re
appear as properties of the product Raw material forms the substance of the product but only 
after it has changed its form Hence raw material and auxiliary substances lose the characteristic 
form  with  which  they  are  clothed  on  entering  the  labourprocess  It  is  otherwise  with  the 
instruments of labour Tools machines workshops and vessels are of use in the labourprocess 
only so long as they retain their original shape and are ready each morning to renew the process 
with their shape unchanged And just as during their lifetime that is to say during the continued 
labourprocess in which they serve they retain their shape independent of the product so too 
they do after their death The corpses of machines tools workshops c are always separate and 
distinct from the product they helped to turn out If we now consider the case of any instrument of 
labour during the whole period of its service from the day of its entry into the workshop till the 
day of its banishment into the lumber room we find that during this period its usevalue has been 
completely consumed and therefore its exchangevalue completely transferred to the product For 
instance if a spinning machine lasts for  years it is plain that during that working period its 
total value is gradually transferred to the product of the  years The lifetime of an instrument of 
labour therefore is spent in the repetition of a greater or less number of similar operations Its 
life may be compared with that of a human being Every day brings a man  hours nearer to his 
grave but how many days he has still to travel on that road no man can tell accurately by merely 
looking at him This difficulty however does not prevent life insurance offices from drawing by 
means of the theory of averages very accurate and at the same time very profitable conclusions 
So  it is  with  the  instruments  of  labour  It  is  known  by  experience  how long  on  the  average  a 
machine of a particular kind will last Suppose its usevalue in the labourprocess to last only six 
days Then on the average it loses each day onesixth of its usevalue and therefore parts with 
onesixth of its value to the daily product The wear and tear of all instruments their daily loss of 
usevalue and the corresponding quantity of value they part with to the product are accordingly 
calculated upon this basis  

 

 

Chapter  
 
It is thus strikingly clear that means of production never transfer more value to the product than 
they themselves lose during the labourprocess by the destruction of their own usevalue If such 
an instrument has no value to lose if in other words it is not the product of human labour it 
transfers no value to the product It helps to create usevalue without contributing to the formation 
of exchangevalue In this class are included all means of production supplied by Nature without 
human assistance such as land wind water metals in situ and timber in virgin forests  
Yet another interesting phenomenon here presents itself Suppose a machine to be worth  
and to wear out in  days Then one thousandth part of the value of the machine is daily 
transferred to the days product At the same time though with diminishing vitality the machine 
as a whole continues to take part in the labourprocess Thus it appears that one factor of the 
labourprocess a means of production continually enters as a whole into that process while it 
enters into the process of the formation of value by fractions only The difference between the 
two  processes is here  reflected in their  material factors  by  the  same  instrument  of  production 
taking  part  as  a  whole  in  the  labourprocess  while  at  the  same  time  as  an  element  in  the 
formation of value it enters only by fractions  
On the other hand a means of production may take part as a whole in the formation of value 
while into the labourprocess it enters only bit by bit Suppose that in spinning cotton the waste 
for every  lbs used amounts to  lbs which is converted not into yarn but into devils 
dust Now although this  lbs of cotton never becomes a constituent element of the yarn yet 
assuming this amount of waste to be normal and inevitable under average conditions of spinning 
its value is just as surely transferred to the value of the yarn as is the value of the  lbs that 
form the substance of the yarn The usevalue of  lbs of cotton must vanish into dust before 
 lbs of yarn can be made The destruction of this cotton is therefore a necessary condition in 
the production of the yarn And because it is a necessary condition and for no other reason the 
value of that cotton is transferred to the product The same holds good for every kind of refuse 
resulting from a labourprocess so far at least as such refuse cannot be further employed as a 
means in the production of new and independent usevalues Such an employment of refuse may 
be seen in the large machine works at Manchester where mountains of iron turnings are carted 
away to the foundry in the evening in order the next morning to reappear in the workshops as 
solid masses of iron  
We  have  seen  that  the  means  of  production  transfer  value  to  the  new  product  so  far  only  as 
during the labourprocess they lose value in the shape of their old usevalue The maximum loss 
of value that they can suffer in the process is plainly limited by the amount of the original value 
with which they came into the process or in other words by the labourtime necessary for their 
production Therefore the means of production can never add more value to the product than they 
themselves possess independently of the process in which they assist However useful a given 
kind of raw material or a  machine or other means of production may be though it may cost 
 or say  days labour yet it cannot under any circumstances add to the value of the 
product more than  Its value is determined not by the labourprocess into which it enters as a 
means of production but by that out of which it has issued as a product In the labourprocess it 
only serves as a mere usevalue a thing with useful properties and could not therefore transfer 
any value to the product unless it possessed such value previously  
While productive labour is changing the means of production into constituent elements of a new 
product their value undergoes a metempsychosis It deserts the consumed body to occupy the 
newly created one But this transmigration takes place as it were behind the back of the labourer 
He is unable to add new labour to create new value without at the same time preserving old 
values and this because the labour he adds must be of a specific useful kind and he cannot do 

 

 

Chapter  
 
work of a useful kind without employing products as the means of production of a new product 
and  thereby  transferring  their  value  to  the  new  product  The  property  therefore  which  labour
power in action living labour possesses of preserving value at the same time that it adds it is a 
gift of Nature which costs the labourer nothing but which is very advantageous to the capitalist 
inasmuch as it preserves the existing value of his capital So long as trade is good the capitalist 
is too much absorbed in moneygrubbing to take notice of this gratuitous gift of labour A violent 
interruption of the labourprocess by a crisis makes him sensitively aware of it  
As  regards  the  means  of  production  what  is  really  consumed  is  their  usevalue  and  the 
consumption of this usevalue by labour results in the product There is no consumption of their 
value and it would therefore be inaccurate to say that it is reproduced It is rather preserved not 
by reason of any operation it undergoes itself in the process but because the article in which it 
originally exists vanishes it is true but vanishes into some other article Hence in the value of 
the product there is a reappearance of the value of the means of production but there is strictly 
speaking no reproduction of that value That which is produced is a new usevalue in which the 
old exchangevalue reappears  
It  is  otherwise  with  the  subjective  factor  of  the  labourprocess  with  labourpower  in  action 
While the labourer by virtue of his labour being of a specialised kind that has a special object 
preserves and transfers to the product the value of the means of production he at the same time 
by the mere act of working creates each instant an additional or new value Suppose the process 
of production to be stopped just when the workman has produced an equivalent for the value of 
his own labourpower when for example by six hours labour he has added a value of three 
shillings This value is the surplus of the total value of the product over the portion of its value 
that  is  due  to  the  means  of  production  It  is  the  only  original  bit  of  value  formed  during  this 
process the only portion of the value of the product created by this process Of course we do not 
forget that this new value only replaces the money advanced by the capitalist in the purchase of 
the labourpower and spent by the labourer on the necessaries of life With regard to the money 
spent the new value is merely a reproduction but nevertheless it is an actual and not as in the 
case of the value of the means of production only an apparent reproduction The substitution of 
one value for another is here effected by the creation of new value  
We know however from what has gone before that the labourprocess may continue beyond the 
time necessary to reproduce and incorporate in the product a mere equivalent for the value of the 
labourpower Instead of the six hours that are sufficient for the latter purpose the process may 
continue for  twelve  hours  The  action  of  labourpower therefore not  only  reproduces  its  own 
value  but  produces  value  over  and  above  it  This  surplusvalue  is  the  difference  between  the 
value of the product and the value of the elements consumed in the formation of that product in 
other words of the means of production and the labourpower  
By our explanation of the different parts played by the various factors of the labourprocess in the 
formation  of  the  products  value  we  have  in  fact  disclosed  the  characters  of  the  different 
functions allotted to the different elements of capital in the process of expanding its own value 
The surplus of the total value of the product over the sum of the values of its constituent factors 
is  the  surplus  of  the  expanded  capital  over  the  capital  originally  advanced  The  means  of 
production  on  the  one  hand  labourpower  on  the  other  are  merely  the  different  modes  of 
existence  which  the  value  of  the  original  capital  assumed  when  from  being  money  it  was 
transformed  into  the  various  factors  of  the  labourprocess  That  part  of  capital  then  which  is 
represented  by  the  means  of  production  by  the  raw  material  auxiliary  material  and  the 
instruments of labour does not in the process of production undergo any quantitative alteration 
of value I therefore call it the constant part of capital or more shortly constant capital  

 

 

Chapter  
 
On  the  other  hand  that  part  of  capital  represented  by  labourpower  does  in  the  process  of 
production undergo an alteration of value It both reproduces the equivalent of its own value and 
also produces an excess a surplusvalue which may itself vary may be more or less according to 
circumstances  This  part  of  capital  is  continually  being  transformed  from  a  constant  into  a 
variable magnitude I therefore call it the variable part of capital or shortly variable capital The 
same elements of capital which from the point of view of the labourprocess present themselves 
respectively as the objective and subjective factors as means of production and labourpower 
present themselves from the point of view of the process of creating surplusvalue as constant 
and variable capital  
The definition of constant capital given above by no means excludes the possibility of a change of 
value in its elements Suppose the price of cotton to be one day sixpence a pound and the next 
day in consequence of a failure of the cotton crop a shilling a pound Each pound of the cotton 
bought at sixpence and worked up after the rise in value transfers to the product a value of one 
shilling and the cotton already spun before the rise and perhaps circulating in the market as yarn 
likewise transfers to the product twice its original value It is plain however that these changes 
of value are independent of the increment or surplusvalue added to the value of the cotton by the 
spinning itself If the old cotton had never been spun it could after the rise be resold at a shilling 
a pound instead of at sixpence Further the fewer the processes the cotton has gone through the 
more certain is this result We therefore find that speculators make it a rule when such sudden 
changes in value occur to speculate in that material on which the least possible quantity of labour 
has been spent to speculate therefore in yarn rather than in cloth in cotton itself rather than in 
yarn The change of value in the case we have been considering originates not in the process in 
which the cotton plays the part of a means of production and in which it therefore functions as 
constant  capital  but  in  the  process  in  which  the  cotton  itself  is  produced  The  value  of  a 
commodity it is true is determined by the quantity of labour contained in it but this quantity is 
itself  limited  by  social  conditions  If  the  time  socially  necessary  for  the  production  of  any 
commodity alters  and a given weight of cotton represents after a bad harvest more labour than 
after a good one  all previously existing commodities of the same class are affected because 
they are as it were only individuals of the species and their value at any given time is measured 
by the labour socially necessary ie by the labour necessary for their production under the then 
existing social conditions  
As the value of the raw material may change so too may that of the instruments of labour of the 
machinery  c  employed  in  the  process  and  consequently  that  portion  of  the  value  of  the 
product  transferred  to  it  from  them  may  also  change  If  in  consequence  of  a  new  invention 
machinery of a particular kind can be produced by a diminished expenditure of labour the old 
machinery becomes depreciated more or less and consequently transfers so much less value to 
the  product  But  here  again  the  change  in  value  originates  outside  the  process  in  which  the 
machine is acting as a means of production Once engaged in this process the machine cannot 
transfer more value than it possesses apart from the process  
Just as a change in the value of the means of production even after they have commenced to take 
a part in the labourprocess does not alter their character as constant capital so too a change in 
the proportion of constant to variable capital does not affect the respective functions of these two 
kinds of capital The technical conditions of the labourprocess may be revolutionised to such an 
extent that where formerly ten men using ten implements of small value worked up a relatively 
small quantity of raw material one man may now with the aid of one expensive machine work 
up one hundred times as much raw material In the latter case we have an enormous increase in 
the constant capital that is represented by the total value of the means of production used and at 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the  same  time  a  great  reduction  in  the  variable  capital  invested  in  labourpower  Such  a 
revolution however alters only the quantitative relation between the constant and the variable 
capital  or  the  proportions  in  which  the  total  capital  is  split  up  into  its  constant  and  variable 
constituents  it  has  not  in  the  least  degree  affected  the  essential  difference  between  the  two

expended  on  the  repairs  of  instruments  is  included  in  the  labour  necessary  for  their  original 
production But in the text we deal with that wear and tear which no doctor can cure and which little 
by little brings about death with that kind of wear which cannot be repaired from time to time and 
which in the case of a knife would ultimately reduce it to a state in which the cutler would say of it it 
is  not  worth  a  new  blade  We  have  shewn  in  the  text  that  a  machine  takes  part  in  every  labour
process as an integral machine but that into the simultaneous process of creating value it enters only 
bit by bit How great then is the confusion of ideas exhibited in the following extract Mr Ricardo 
says a portion of the labour of the engineer in making stocking machines is contained for example 
in the value of a pair of stockings Yet the total labour that produced each single pair of stockings  
includes the whole labour of the engineer not a portion for one machine makes many pairs and none 
of  those  pairs  could  have  been  done  without  any  part  of  the  machine  Obs  on  Certain  Verbal

aspects  of  labour  and  still  less  therefore  the  part  played  by  it  under  each  of  these  aspects  in  the

Chapter  The Rate of SurplusValue 

Section  The Degree of Exploitation of LabourPower 

The surplusvalue generated in the process of production by C the capital advanced or in other 
words the selfexpansion of the value of the capital C presents itself for our consideration in the 
first place as a surplus as the amount by which the value of the product exceeds the value of its 
constituent elements  
The capital C is made up of two components one the sum of money c laid out upon the means of 
production and the other the sum of money v expended upon the labourpower c represents the 
portion that has become constant capital and v the portion that has become variable capital At 
first then C  c  v for example if  is the capital advanced its components may be such 
that  the        const      var  When  the  process  of  production  is  finished  we  get  a 
commodity whose value  c  v  s where s is the surplusvalue or taking our former figures 
the value of this commodity may be  const   var   surpl The original capital has 
now changed from C to C from  to  The difference is s or a surplusvalue of  
Since the value of the constituent elements of the product is equal to the value of the advanced 
capital it is mere tautology to say that the excess of the value of the product over the value of its 
constituent  elements is equal to  the  expansion of the  capital advanced  or to  the  surplusvalue 
produced  
Nevertheless we must examine this tautology a little more closely The two things compared are 
the value of the product and the value of its constituents consumed in the process of production 
Now we have seen how that portion of the constant capital which consists of the instruments of 
labour transfers to the production only a fraction of its value while the remainder of that value 
continues to reside in those instruments Since this remainder plays no part in the formation of 
value we may at present leave it on one side To introduce it into the calculation would make no 
difference  For  instance  taking  our  former  example c     suppose this  sum  to  consist of 
 value of raw material  value of auxiliary material and  value of the machinery worn 
away in the process and suppose that the total value of the machinery employed is  Out of 
this latter sum then we reckon as advanced for the purpose of turning out the product the sum of 
 alone which the machinery loses by wear and tear in the process for this is all it parts with 
to  the  product  Now  if  we  also  reckon  the  remaining    which  still  continues  in  the 
machinery as transferred to the product we ought also to reckon it as part of the value advanced 
and thus make it appear on both sides of our calculation We should in this way get  on 
one side and  on the other The difference of these two sums or the surplusvalue would 
still be  Throughout this Book therefore by constant capital advanced for the production of 
value  we  always  mean  unless  the  context  is  repugnant  thereto  the  value  of  the  means  of 
production actually consumed in the process and that value alone  
This being so let us return to the formula C  c  v which we saw was transformed into C  c  
v    s  C  becoming  C  We  know  that  the  value  of  the  constant  capital  is  transferred  to  and 
merely  reappears  in  the  product  The  new  value  actually  created  in  the  process  the  value

Chapter  
 
labourpower and materials supplied by Nature in that case there would be no constant capital to 
transfer to the product This component of the value of the product ie the  in our example 
would  be  eliminated  but  the  sum  of    the  amount  of  new  value  created  or  the  value 
produced which contains  of surplusvalue would remain just as great as if c represented the 
highest value imaginable We should have C    v  v or C the expanded capital  v  s and 
therefore C  C  s as before On the other hand if s   or in other words if the labourpower 
whose value is advanced in the form of variable capital were to produce only its equivalent we 
should have C  c  v or C the value of the product  c  v   or C  C The capital advanced 
would in this case not have expanded its value  
From what has gone before we know that surplusvalue is purely the result of a variation in the 
value of v of that portion of the capital which is transformed into labourpower consequently v 
  s    v    v  or  v  plus  an  increment  of  v  But  the  fact  that  it  is  v  alone  that  varies  and  the 
conditions of that variation are obscured by the circumstance that in consequence of the increase 
in the variable component of the capital there is also an increase in the sum total of the advanced 
capital It was originally  and becomes  Therefore in order that our investigation may 
lead to accurate results we must make abstraction from that portion of the value of the product in 
which constant capital alone appears and consequently must equate the constant capital to zero or 
make c   This is merely an application of a mathematical rule employed whenever we operate 
with  constant  and  variable  magnitudes  related  to  each  other  by  the  symbols  of  addition  and 
subtraction only  
A further difficulty is caused by the original form of the variable capital In our example C  
 const   var   surpl but  is a given and therefore a constant quantity hence it 
appears absurd to treat it as variable But in fact the term  var is here merely a symbol to 
show that this value undergoes a process The portion of the capital invested in the purchase of 
labourpower is a definite quantity of materialised labour a constant value like the value of the 
labourpower purchased But in the process of production the place of the  is taken by the 
labourpower  in  action  dead  labour  is  replaced  by  living  labour  something  stagnant  by 
something flowing a constant by a variable The result is the reproduction of v plus an increment 
of  v  From  the  point  of  view  then  of  capitalist  production  the  whole  process  appears  as  the 
spontaneous variation of the originally constant value which is transformed into labourpower 
Both the process and its result appear to be owing to this value If therefore such expressions as 
  variable  capital  or  so  much  selfexpanding  value  appear  contradictory  this  is  only 
because they bring to the surface a contradiction immanent in capitalist production  
At first sight it appears a strange proceeding to equate the constant capital to zero Yet it is what 
we do every day If for example we wish to calculate the amount of Englands profits from the 
cotton industry we first of all deduct the sums paid for cotton to the United States India Egypt 
and other countries in other words the value of the capital that merely reappears in the value of 
the product is put    
Of  course  the  ratio  of  surplusvalue  not  only  to  that  portion  of  the  capital  from  which  it 
immediately springs and whose change of value it represents but also to the sum total of the 
capital advanced is economically of very great importance We shall therefore in the third book 
treat of this ratio exhaustively In order to enable one portion of a capital to expand its value by 
being converted into labourpower it is necessary that another portion be converted into means of 
production  In  order  that  variable  capital  may  perform  its  function  constant  capital  must  be 
advanced  in  proper  proportion  a  proportion  given  by  the  special  technical  conditions  of  each 
labourprocess  The  circumstance  however  that  retorts  and  other  vessels  are  necessary  to  a 
chemical process does not compel the chemist to notice them in the result of his analysis If we 

 

 

Chapter  
 
look at the means of production in their relation to the creation of value and to the variation in 
the  quantity  of  value  apart  from  anything  else  they  appear  simply  as  the  material  in  which 
labourpower  the  valuecreator  incorporates  itself  Neither  the  nature  nor  the  value  of  this 
material is of any importance The only requisite is that there be a sufficient supply to absorb the 
labour expended in the process of production That supply once given the material may rise or 
fall in value or even be as land and the sea without any value in itself but this will have no 
influence on the creation of value or on the variation in the quantity of value  
In the first place then we equate the constant capital to zero The capital advanced is consequently 
reduced from c  v to v and instead of the value of the product c  v  s we have now the value 
produced v  s Given the new value produced   which sum consequently represents the 
whole labour expended during the process then subtracting from it  the value of the variable 
capital we have remaining  the amount of the surplusvalue This sum of  or s expresses 
the absolute quantity of surplusvalue produced The relative quantity produced or the increase 
per cent of the variable capital is determined it is plain by the ratio of the surplusvalue to the 
variable capital or is expressed by sv In our example this ratio is  which gives an increase 
of  This relative increase in the value of the variable capital or the relative magnitude of 
the surplusvalue I call The rate of surplusvalue  
We have seen that the labourer during one portion of the labourprocess produces only the value 
of his labourpower that is the value of his means of subsistence Now since his work forms part 
of  a  system  based  on  the  social  division  of  labour  he  does  not  directly  produce  the  actual 
necessaries  which  he  himself  consumes  he  produces  instead  a  particular  commodity  yarn  for 
example whose value is equal to the value of those necessaries or of the money with which they 
can be bought The portion of his days labour devoted to this purpose will be greater or less in 
proportion to the value of the necessaries that he daily requires on an average or what amounts 
to the same thing in proportion to the labourtime required on an average to produce them If the 
value  of  those  necessaries  represent  on  an  average  the  expenditure  of  six  hours  labour  the 
workman must on an average work for six hours to produce that value If instead of working for 
the capitalist he worked independently on his own account he would other things being equal 
still  be  obliged  to  labour  for  the  same  number  of  hours  in  order  to  produce  the  value  of  his 
labourpower  and  thereby  to  gain  the  means  of  subsistence  necessary  for  his  conservation  or 
continued reproduction But as we have seen during that portion of his days labour in which he 
produces the value of his labourpower say three shillings he produces only an equivalent for the 
value of his labourpower already advanced by the capitalist the new value created only replaces 
the variable capital advanced It is owing to this fact that the production of the new value of three 
shillings  takes  the  semblance  of  a  mere  reproduction  That  portion  of  the  working  day  then 
during  which  this  reproduction  takes  place  I  call  necessary  labour  time  and  the  labour 
expended during that time I call necessary labour Necessary as regards the labourer because 
independent  of  the  particular  social  form  of  his  labour  necessary  as  regards  capital  and  the 
world of capitalists because on the continued existence of the labourer depends their existence 
also  
During the second period of the labourprocess that in which his labour is no longer necessary 
labour the workman it is true labours expends labourpower but his labour being no longer 
necessary  labour  he  creates  no  value  for  himself  He  creates  surplusvalue  which  for  the 
capitalist has all the charms of a creation out of nothing This portion of the working day I name 
surplus  labourtime  and  to  the  labour  expended  during  that  time  I  give  the  name  of  surplus 
labour It is every bit as important for a correct understanding of surplusvalue to conceive it as a 
mere congelation of surplus labourtime as nothing but materialised surplus labour as it is for a 

 

 

Chapter  
 
proper comprehension of value to conceive it as a mere congelation of so many hours of labour 
as nothing but materialised labour The essential difference between the various economic forms 
of society between for instance a society based on slavelabour and one based on wagelabour 
lies  only  in  the  mode  in  which  this  surplus  labour  is  in  each  case  extracted  from  the  actual 
producer the labourer  
Since on the one hand the values of the variable capital and of the labourpower purchased by 
that capital are equal and the value of this labourpower determines the necessary portion of the 
working day and since on the other hand the surplusvalue is determined by the surplus portion 
of  the  working  day  it  follows  that  surplusvalue  bears  the  same  ratio  to  variable  capital  that 
surplus labour does to necessary labour or in other words the rate of surplusvalue sv  surplus 
labournecessary labour Both ratios sv and surplus labournecessary labour express the 
same thing in different ways in the one case by reference to materialised incorporated labour in 
the other by reference to living fluent labour  
The rate of surplusvalue is therefore an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labour
power by capital or of the labourer by the capitalist  
We assumed in our example that the value of the product   const   var   surpl 
and that the capital advanced   Since the surplusvalue   and the advanced capital  
  we  should  according  to  the  usual  way  of  reckoning  get  as  the  rate  of  surplusvalue 
generally confounded with rate of profits  a rate so low as possibly to cause a pleasant 
surprise to Mr Carey and other harmonisers But in truth the rate of surplusvalue is not equal to 
sC or scv but to sv thus it is not  but  or  which is more than five times 
the apparent degree of exploitation Although in the case we have supposed we are ignorant of 
the actual length of the working day and of the duration in days or weeks of the labourprocess 
as also of the number of labourers employed yet the rate of surplusvalue sv accurately discloses 
to us by means of its equivalent expression surplus labournecessary labour the relation between 
the  two  parts  of  the  working  day  This  relation  is  here  one  of  equality  the  rate  being   
Hence it is plain the labourer in our example works one half of the day for himself the other 
half for the capitalist  
The method of calculating the rate of surplusvalue is therefore shortly as follows We take the 
total value of the product and put the constant capital which merely reappears in it equal to zero 
What  remains  is  the  only  value  that  has  in  the  process  of  producing  the  commodity  been 
actually  created  If  the  amount  of surplusvalue  be  given  we  have  only  to  deduct it  from  this 
remainder to find the variable capital And vice vers if the latter be given and we require to 
find the surplusvalue If both be given we have only to perform the concluding operation viz 
to calculate sv the ratio of the surplusvalue to the variable capital  
Though the method is so simple yet it may not be amiss by means of a few examples to exercise 
the reader in the application of the novel principles underlying it  
First we will take the case of a spinning mill containing  mule spindles spinning No  
yarn from American cotton and producing  lb of yarn weekly per spindle We assume the waste 
to be  under these circumstances  lbs of cotton are consumed weekly of which  
lbs  go  to  waste  The  price  of  the  cotton  in  April    was  d  per  lb  the  raw  material 
therefore  costs in round  numbers   The   spindles  including  preparationmachinery 
and motive power cost we will assume  per spindle amounting to a total of  The 
wear and tear we put at  or  yearly   weekly The rent of the building we suppose 
to be  a year or  a week Coal consumed for  horsepower indicated at  lbs of coal 
per horsepower per hour during  hours and inclusive of that consumed in heating the mill  
tons a week at s d a ton amounts to about  a week gas  a week oil c  a week 
 

 

Chapter  
 
Total  cost  of  the  above  auxiliary  materials    weekly  Therefore  the  constant  portion  of the 
value of the weeks product is  Wages amount to  a week The price of the yarn is d 
per lb which gives for the value of  lbs the sum of  The surplusvalue is therefore in 
this case      We put the constant part of the value of the product   as it plays 
no part in the creation of value There remains  as the weekly value created which   
var   surpl The rate of surplusvalue is therefore     In a working day of 
 hours with average labour the result is necessary labour    hours and surplus labour  
   
One  more  example  Jacob  gives  the  following  calculation  for  the  year    Owing  to  the 
previous  adjustment  of  several  items  it  is  very  imperfect  nevertheless  for  our  purpose  it  is 
sufficient In it he assumes the price of wheat to be s a quarter and the average yield per acre to 
be  bushels

in detail we simply add them together and the sum is a surplusvalue of  s d The sum of 
 s d paid for seed and manure is constant capital and we put it equal to zero There is left 
the sum of  s d which is the variable capital advanced and we see that a new value of

working  day  in  producing  the  surplusvalue  which  different  persons  under  different  pretexts 
share amongst themselves  
Section  The Representation of the Components of the Value 
of the Product by Corresponding Proportional Parts of the 

Product Itself 

Let us now return to the example by which we were shown how the capitalist converts money 
into capital  
The product of a working day of  hours is  lbs of yarn having a value of s No less than 
ths of this value or s is due to mere reappearance in it of the value of the means of 
production    lbs  of cotton  value  s  and spindle  worn  away  s it is therefore  constant 
capital The remaining ths or s is the new value created during the spinning process of this 
one half replaces the value of the days labourpower or the variable capital the remaining half 
constitutes a surplusvalue of s The total value then of the  lbs of yarn is made up as follows  
s value of yarn  s const  s var  s surpl  
Since the  whole  of this  value  is  contained  in  the   lbs  of  yarn  produced  it  follows  that  the 
various  component  parts  of  this  value  can  be  represented  as  being  contained  respectively  in 
corresponding parts of the product  

 

 

Chapter  
 
If the value of s is contained in  lbs of yarn then ths of this value or the s that form 
its constant part is contained in ths of the product or in  lbs of yarn Of the latter   
lbs represent the value of the raw material the s worth of cotton spun and   lbs represent 
the s worth of spindle c worn away in the process  
Hence the whole of the cotton used up in spinning the  lbs of yarn is represented by   
lbs of yarn This latter weight of yarn contains it is true by weight no more than   lbs of 
cotton  worth      shillings  but  the      shillings  additional  value  contained  in  it  are  the 
equivalent for the cotton consumed in spinning the remaining   lbs of yarn The effect is the 
same as if these   lbs of yarn contained no cotton at all and the whole  lbs of cotton were 
concentrated in the   lbs of yarn The latter weight on the other hand does not contain an 
atom either of the value of the auxiliary materials and implements or of the value newly created 
in the process  
In the same way the   lbs of yarn in which the s the remainder of the constant capital is 
embodied represents nothing but the value of the auxiliary materials and instruments of labour 
consumed in producing the  lbs of yarn  
We have therefore arrived at this result although eighttenths of the product or  lbs of yarn 
is in its character of an article of utility just as much the fabric of the spinners labour as the 
remainder of the same product yet when viewed in this connexion it does not contain and has 
not absorbed any labour expended during the process of spinning It is just as if the cotton had 
converted itself into  yarn without help  as  if the  shape  it had  assumed  was  mere trickery  and 
deceit for so soon as our capitalist sells it for s and with the money replaces his means of 
production it becomes evident that this  lbs of yarn is nothing more than so much cotton and 
spindlewaste in disguise  
On the other hand the remaining ths of the product or  lbs of yarn represent nothing but 
the new value of s created during the  hours spinning process All the value transferred to 
those  lbs from the raw material and instruments of labour consumed was so to say intercepted 
in order to be incorporated in the  lbs first spun In this case it is as if the spinner had spun  
lbs of yarn out of air or as if he had spun them with the aid of cotton and spindles that being 
the spontaneous gift of Nature transferred no value to the product  
Of  this    lbs  of  yarn  in  which  the  whole  of  the  value  newly  created  during  the  process  is 
condensed one half represents the equivalent for the value of the labour consumed or the s 
variable capital the other half represents the s surplusvalue  
Since  workinghours of the spinner are embodied in s it follows that in yarn of the value of 
s there must be embodied  workinghours And this quantity of labourtime does in fact 
exist in the  lbs of yarn for in ths or  lbs there are materialised the  hours of labour 
expended before the commencement of the spinning process on the means of production and in 
the remaining ths or  lbs there are materialised the  hours work done during the process 
itself  
On a former page we saw that the value of the yarn is equal to the sum of the new value created 
during the production of that yarn plus the value previously existing in the means of production  
It has now been shown how the various component parts of the value of the product parts that 
differ functionally from each other may be represented by corresponding proportional parts of 
the product itself  
To split up in this manner the product into different parts of which one represents only the labour 
previously spent on the means of production or the constant capital another only the necessary 
labour spent during the process of production or the variable capital and another and last part 
 

 

Chapter  
 
only the surplus labour expended during the same process or the surplusvalue to do this is as 
will be seen later on from its application to complicated and hitherto unsolved problems no less 
important than it is simple  
In the preceding investigation we have treated the total product as the final result ready for use 
of a working day of  hours We can however follow this total product through all the stages of 
its production and in this way we shall arrive at the same result as before if we represent the 
partial products given off at the different stages as functionally different parts of the final or total 
product  
The spinner produces in  hours  lbs of yarn or in  hour  lbs consequently he produces 
in  hours  lbs or a partial product equal in value to all the cotton that is spun in a whole 
day In like manner the partial product of the next period of  hour and  minutes is  lbs of 
yarn this represents the value of the instruments of labour that are consumed in  hours In the 
following  hour and    minutes  the spinner  produces    lbs  of  yarn  worth    shillings  a  value 
equal to the whole value he creates in his  hours necessary labour Finally in the last hour and 
 minutes he produces another  lbs of yarn whose value is equal to the surplusvalue created 
by  his  surplus  labour  during  half  a  day  This  method  of  calculation  serves  the  English 
manufacturer  for  everyday  use  it  shows  he  will  say  that  in  the  first    hours  or    of  the 
working day he gets back the value of his cotton and so on for the remaining hours It is also a 
perfectly  correct  method  being  in  fact  the  first  method  given  above  with  this  difference  that 
instead of being applied to space in which the different parts of the completed product lie side by 
side  it  deals  with  time  in  which  those  parts  are  successively  produced  But  it  can  also  be 
accompanied by very barbarian notions more especially in the heads of those who are as much 
interested  practically  in  the  process  of  making  value  beget  value  as  they  are  in 
misunderstanding that process theoretically Such people may get the notion into their heads that 
our spinner for example produces or replaces in the first  hours of his working day the value of 
the  cotton  in  the  following  hour  and    minutes  the  value  of  the  instruments  of  labour  worn 
away  in  the  next  hour  and    minutes  the  value  of  the  wages  and  that  he  devotes  to  the 
production of surplusvalue for the manufacturer only that well known last hour In this way 
the poor spinner is made to perform the twofold miracle not only of producing cotton spindles 
steamengine coal oil c at the same time that he spins with them but also of turning one 
working day into five for in the example we are considering the production of the raw material 
and instruments of labour demands four working days of twelve hours each and their conversion 
into yarn requires another such day That the love of lucre induces an easy belief in such miracles 
and that sycophant doctrinaires are never wanting to prove them is vouched for by the following 
incident of historical celebrity  

Section  Seniors Last Hour 

One  fine  morning  in  the  year    Nassau  W  Senior  who  may  be  called  the  belesprit  of 
English economists well known alike for his economic science and for his beautiful style was 
summoned from Oxford to Manchester to learn in the latter place the Political Economy that he 
taught  in  the  former  The  manufacturers  elected  him  as  their  champion  not  only  against  the 
newly passed Factory Act but against the still more menacing Tenhours agitation With their 
usual practical acuteness they had found out that the learned Professor wanted a good deal of 
finishing it was this discovery that caused them to write for him On his side the Professor has 
embodied  the  lecture  he  received  from  the  Manchester  manufacturers  in  a  pamphlet  entitled 
Letters on the Factory Act as it affects the cotton manufacture London  Here we find 
amongst others the following edifying passage 
 

 

 

Chapter  

Under the present law no mill in which persons under  years of age are 
employed  can be worked more than  hours a day that is  hours for  
days in the week and nine on Saturday  
Now the following analysis  will show that in a mill so worked the whole net 
profit is derived from the last hour I will suppose a manufacturer to invest 
   in his mill and machinery and  in raw material and 
wages The annual return of that mill supposing the capital to be turned once a 
year and gross profits to be  per cent ought to be goods worth  Of 
this  each of the twentythree halfhours of work produces ths or 
one twentythird Of these rds constituting the whole  twenty that 
is to say  out of the  simply replace the capital  one twenty
third or  out of the  makes up for the deterioration of the mill 
and machinery The remaining rds that is the last two of the twentythree 
halfhours of every day produce the net profit of  per cent If therefore prices 
remaining the same the factory could be kept at work thirteen hours instead of 
eleven and a half with an addition of about  to the circulating capital the 
net profit would be more than doubled On the other hand if the hours of working 
were reduced by one hour per day prices remaining the same the net profit 
would be destroyed  if they were reduced by one hour and a half even the gross 
profit would be destroyed  

And  the  Professor  calls  this  an  analysis  If  giving  credence  to  the  outcries  of  the 
manufacturers he believed that the workmen spend the best part of the day in the production ie 
the reproduction or replacement of the value of the buildings machinery cotton coal c then 
his  analysis  was  superfluous  His  answer  would  simply  have  been    Gentlemen  if  you  work 
your mills for  hours instead of  then other things being equal the daily consumption of 
cotton  machinery  c  will  decrease  in  proportion You  gain just  as  much  as you  lose  Your 
workpeople will in future spend one hour and a half less time in reproducing or replacing the 
capital that has been advanced  If on the other hand he did not believe them without further 
inquiry but as being an expert in such matters deemed an analysis necessary then he ought in a 
question that is concerned exclusively with the relations of net profit to the length of the working 
day  before  all  things  to  have  asked  the  manufacturers  to  be  careful  not  to  lump  together 
machinery  workshops  raw  material  and  labour  but  to  be  good  enough  to  place  the  constant 
capital invested in buildings machinery raw material c on one side of the account and the 
capital advanced in wages on the other side If the Professor then found that in accordance with 
the calculation of the manufacturers the workman reproduced or replaced his wages in  half
hours in that case he should have continued his analysis thus  
According to your figures the workman in the last hour but one produces his wages and in the 
last hour your surplusvalue or net profit Now since in equal periods he produces equal values 
the produce of the last hour but one must have the same value as that of the last hour Further it 
is  only  while  he  labours  that  he  produces  any  value  at  all  and  the  amount  of  his  labour  is 
measured by his labourtime This you say amounts to  hours a day He employs one portion 
of these  hours in producing or replacing his wages and the remaining portion in producing 
your  net  profit  Beyond  this  he  does  absolutely  nothing  But  since  on  your  assumption  his 
wages and the surplusvalue he yields are of equal value it is clear that he produces his wages in 
 hours and your net profit in the other  hours Again since the value of the yarn produced 
in  hours is equal to the sum of the values of his wages and of your net profit the measure of the 
value of this yarn must be  workinghours of which  hours measure the value of the yarn 

 

 

Chapter  
 
produced in the last hour but one and  the value of the yarn produced in the last hour We 
now come to a ticklish point therefore attention The last workinghour but one is like the first 
an ordinary workinghour neither more nor less How then can the spinner produce in one hour 
in the shape of yarn a value that embodies  hours labour The truth is that he performs no 
such  miracle  The  usevalue  produced  by  him  in  one  hour  is  a  definite  quantity  of  yarn  The 
value of this yarn is measured by  workinghours of which  were without any assistance 
from him previously embodied in the means of production in the cotton the machinery and so 
on the remaining one hour alone is added by him Therefore since his wages are produced in  
hours and the yarn produced in one hour also contains  hours work there is no witchcraft in 
the result that the value created by his  hours spinning is equal to the value of the product 
spun  in  one  hour  You  are  altogether  on  the  wrong  track  if  you  think  that  he  loses  a  single 
moment of his working day in reproducing or replacing the values of the cotton the machinery 
and so on On the contrary it is because his labour converts the cotton and spindles into yarn 
because  he  spins  that  the  values  of  the  cotton  and  spindles  go  over  to  the  yarn  of  their  own 
accord This result is owing to the quality of his labour not to its quantity It is true he will in one 
hour transfer to the yarn more value in the shape of cotton than he will in half an hour but that 
is only because in one hour he spins up more cotton than in half an hour You see then your 
assertion that the workman produces in the last hour but one the value of his wages and in the 
last hour your net profit amounts to no more than this that in the yarn produced by him in  
workinghours whether they are the  first or the  last hours of the working day in that yarn 
there are incorporated  workinghours or just a whole days work ie two hours of his own 
work and  hours of other peoples And my assertion that in the first  hours he produces 
his wages and in the last  hours your net profit amounts only to this that you pay him for the 
former but not for the latter In speaking of payment of labour instead of payment of labour
power I only talk your own slang Now gentlemen if you compare the workingtime you pay 
for with that which you do not pay for you will find that they are to one another as half a day is 
to half a day this gives a rate of  and a very pretty percentage it is Further there is not the 
least  doubt  that  if  you  make  your  hands  toil  for    hours  instead  of    and  as  may  be 
expected from you treat the work done in that extra one hour and a half as pure surplus labour 
then  the  latter  will  be  increased  from    hours  labour  to    hours  labour  and  the  rate  of 
surplusvalue from  to   So that you are altogether too sanguine in expecting that 
by such an addition of  hours to the working day the rate will rise from  to  and 
more in other words that it will be more than doubled On the other hand  mans heart is a 
wonderful thing especially when carried in the purse  you take too pessimist a view when you 
fear that with a reduction of the hours of labour from  to  the whole of your net profit will 
go to the dogs Not at all All other conditions remaining the same the surplus labour will fall 
from    hours  to    hours  a  period  that  still  gives  a  very  profitable  rate  of  surplusvalue 
namely   But this dreadful last hour about which you have invented more stories 
than have the millenarians about the day of judgment is all bosh If it goes it will cost neither 
you  your  net  profit  nor  the  boys  and  girls  whom  you  employ  their  purity  of  mind

time  during  which  he  works 

The portion of the product that represents the surplusvalue one tenth of the  lbs or  lbs of 
yarn in the example given in Sec  we call surplusproduce Just as the rate of surplusvalue 
is determined by its relation not to the sum total of the capital but to its variable part in like 
manner the relative quantity of surplusproduce is determined by the ratio that this produce bears 
not to the remaining part of the total product but to that part of it in which is incorporated the 
necessary  labour  Since  the  production  of  surplusvalue  is  the  chief  end  and  aim  of  capitalist 
production it is clear that the greatness of a mans or a nations wealth should be measured not 
by the absolute quantity produced but by the relative magnitude of the surplusproduce  
The sum of the necessary labour and the surplus labour ie of the periods of time during which 
the workman replaces the value of his labourpower and produces the surplusvalue this sum 
constitutes 
the  working  day 
                                                      
 If we reckon the value of the fixed capital employed as a part of the advances we must reckon the 
remaining  value  of  such  capital  at  the  end  of  the  year  as  a  part  of  the  annual  returns  Malthus

  What  Lucretius  says  is  selfevident  nil  posse  creari  de  nihilo  out  of  nothing  nothing  can  be 
created Creation of value is transformation of labourpower into labour Labourpower itself is energy 
transferred to a human organism by means of nourishing matter 
 In the same way that the English use the terms rate of profit rate of interest We shall see in 
Book III that the rate of profit is no mystery so soon as we know the laws of surplusvalue If we 
reverse the process we cannot comprehend either the one or the other 
  Note  added  in  the  rd  German  edition    The  author  resorts  here  to  the  economic  language  in 
current use It will be remembered that on p  present edition p  it was shown that in reality 
the labourer advances to the capitalist and not the capitalist to the labourer  F E 
 In this work we have up to now employed the term necessary labourtime to designate the time 
necessary under given social conditions for the production of any commodity Henceforward we use it 
to designate also the time necessary for the production of the particular commodity labourpower The 
use of one and the same technical term in different senses is inconvenient but in no science can it be 
altogether avoided Compare for instance the higher with the lower branches of mathematics 
 Herr Wilhelm Thucydides Roscher has found a mares nest He has made the important discovery 
that  if  on  the  one  hand  the  formation  of  surplusvalue  or  surplusproduce  and  the  consequent 
accumulation  of  capital  is  nowadays  due  to  the  thrift  of  the  capitalist  on  the  other  hand  in  the 
lowest  stages  of  civilisation  it  is  the  strong  who  compel  the  weak  to  economise  lc  p    To 
economise what Labour Or superfluous wealth that does not exist What is it that makes such men 
as Roscher account for the origin of surplusvalue by a mere rechauff of the more of less plausible 
excuses  by  the  capitalist  for  his  appropriation  of  surplusvalue  It  is  besides  their  real  ignorance 
their apologetic dread of a scientific analysis of  value  and surplusvalue and of obtaining a result 
possibly not altogether palatable to the powers that be 
 Although the rate of surplusvalue is an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labour
power it is in no sense an expression for the absolute amount of exploitation For example if the 
necessary labour   hours and the surplus labour   hours the degree of exploitation is  The 
amount of exploitation is here measured by  hours If on the other hand the necessary labour   
hours and the surplus labour   hours the degree of exploitation remains as before  while the 
actual amount of exploitation has increased  namely from five hours to six

prices    values  We  shall  however  see  in  Book  III  that  even  in  the  case  of  average  prices  the 
assumption cannot be made in this very simple manner 
  Senior  lc  pp      We  let  pass  such  extraordinary  notions  as  are  of  no  importance  for  our 
purpose for instance the assertion that manufacturers reckon as part of their profit gross or net the 
amount required to make good wear and tear of machinery or in other words to replace a part of the 
capital  So  too  we  pass  over  any  question  as  to  the  accuracy  of  his  figures  Leonard  Horner  has 
shown in A Letter to Mr Senior c London  that they are worth no more than socalled 
Analysis Leonard Horner was one of the Factory Inquiry Commissioners in  and Inspector or 
rather Censor of Factories till  He rendered undying service to the English workingclass He 
carried on a lifelong contest not only with the embittered manufacturers but also with the Cabinet to 
whom  the  number  of  votes  given  by  the  masters  in  the  Lower  House  was  a  matter  of  far  greater 
importance than the number of hours worked by the hands in the mills 
Apart from efforts in principle Seniors statement is confused What he really intended to say was 
this  The  manufacturer  employs  the  workman  for    hours  or  for    halfhours  daily  As  the 
working day so too the working year may be conceived to consist of  hours or  halfhours 
but each multiplied by the number of working days in the year On this supposition the  halfhours 
yield an annual product of  one halfhour yields     halfhours yield  
    ie they replace no more than the capital advanced There remain  half
hours which yield      or the gross profit Of these  halfhours one yields  
    ie it makes up for the wear and tear of the machinery the remaining  half
hours ie the last hour yield      or the net profit In the text Senior converts 
the last  of the product into portions of the working day itself 
  If  on  the  one  hand  Senior  proved  that  the  net  profit  of  the  manufacturer  the  existence  of  he 
English  cotton  industry  and  Englands  command  of  the  markets  of  the  world  depend  on  the  last 
workinghour on the other hand Dr Andrew Ure showed that if children and young persons under 
 years of age instead of being kept the full  hours in the warm and pure moral atmosphere of the 
factory  are  turned  out  an  hour  sooner  into  the  heartless  and  frivolous  outer  world  they  will  be 
deprived  by  idleness  and  vice  of  all  hope  of  salvation  for  their  souls  Since    the  factory 
inspectors have never tired of twitting the masters with this last this fatal hour Thus Mr Hovell 
in his report of the st May  Had the following ingenious calculation he quotes Senior been 
correct every cotton factory in the United Kingdom would have been working at a loss since the year 
 Reports of the Insp of Fact for the halfyear ending th April  pp   In the 
year  after the passing of the  hours bill the masters of some flax spinning mills scattered 
few and far between over the country on the borders of Dorset and Somerset foisted a petition against 
the bill on to the shoulders of a few of their workpeople One of the clauses of this petition is as 
follows Your petitioners as parents conceive that an additional hour of leisure will tend more to 
demoralise  the  children  than  otherwise  believing  that  idleness  is  the  parent  of  vice  On  this  the 
factory report of st Oct  says The atmosphere of the flax mills in which the children of these 
virtuous and tender parents work is so loaded with dust and fibre from the raw  material that it is 
exceptionally unpleasant to stand even  minutes in the spinning rooms for you are unable to do so 
without  the  most  painful  sensation  owing  to  the  eyes  the  ears  the  nostrils  and  mouth  being 
immediately filled by the clouds of flax dust from which there is no escape The labour itself owing to 
the feverish haste of the machinery demands unceasing application of skill and movement under the 
control of a watchfulness that never tires and it seems somewhat hard to let parents apply the term

such an occupation in such an atmosphere These children work longer than the labourers in the 
neighbouring villages Such cruel talk about idleness and vice ought to be branded as the purest 
cant and the most shameless hypocrisy That portion of the public who about  years ago were 
struck by  the assurance with which under the sanction of high authority  it was publicly and  most 
earnestly proclaimed that the whole net profit of the manufacturer flows from the labour of the last 
hour and that therefore the reduction of the working day by one hour would destroy his net profit 
that portion of the public we say will hardly believe its own eyes when it now finds that the original 
discovery of the virtues of the last hour has since been so far improved as to include morals as well 
as profit so that if the duration of the labour of children is reduced to a full  hours their morals 
together with the net profits of their employers will vanish both being dependent on this last this 
fatal hour See Repts Insp of Fact for st Oct  p  The same report then gives some 
examples  of  the  morality  and  virtue  of  these  same  pureminded  manufacturers  of  the  tricks  the 
artifices the cajoling the threats and the falsifications they made use of in order first to compel a 
few defenceless workmen to sign petitions of such a kind and then to impose them upon Parliament 
as the petitions of a whole branch of industry or a whole country It is highly characteristic of the 
present status of socalled economic science that neither Senior himself who at a later period to his 
honour be it said energetically supported the factory legislation nor his opponents from first to last 
have ever been able to explain the false conclusions of the original discovery They appeal to actual 
experience but the why and wherefore remains a mystery 
 Nevertheless the learned professor was not without some benefit from his journey to Manchester 
In the Letters on the Factory Act he makes the whole net gains including profit and interests 
and  even  something  more  depend  upon  a  single  unpaid  hours  work  of  the  labourer  One  year 
previously in his Outlines of Political Economy written for the instruction of Oxford students and 
cultivated Philistines he had also discovered in opposition to Ricardos determination of value by 
labour that profit is derived from the labour of the capitalist and interest from his asceticism in other 
words from his abstinence The dodge was an old one but the word abstinence was new Herr

 To an individual with a capital of  whose profits were  per annum it would be a 
matter quite indifferent whether his capital would employ a  or  men whether the commodity 
produced sold for  or  provided in all cases his profit were not diminished below

be the same it is of no importance whether the nation consists of  or of  millions of inhabitants

Chapter  The Working day 
Section  The Limits of the Working day 

We started with the supposition that labourpower is bought and sold at its value Its value like 
that of all other commodities is determined by the workingtime necessary to its production If 
the production of the average daily means of subsistence of the labourer takes up  hours he must 
work on the average  hours every day to produce his daily labourpower or to reproduce the 
value received as the result of its sale The necessary part of his working day amounts to  hours 
and is therefore caeteris paribus other things being equal a given quantity But with this the 
extent of the working day itself is not yet given 
Let us assume that the line AB represents the length of the necessary workingtime say  
hours If the labour be prolonged   or  hours beyond AB we have  other lines 

Working day I  Working day II  Working day III 

ABC 

ABC 

ABC 

representing  different working days of   and  hours The extension BC of the line AB 
represents the  length  of the  surplus  labour  As  the  working  day  is  AB    BC  or  AC it 
varies with the variable quantity BC Since AB is constant the ratio of BC to AB can 
always be calculated In working day I it is  in working day II  in working day III  of 
AB  Since  further  the ratio  surplus  workingtimenecessary  workingtime  determines the 
rate of the surplusvalue the latter is given by the ratio of BC to AB It amounts in the  
different working days respectively to    and  per cent On the other hand the rate of 
surplusvalue alone would not give us the extent of the working day If this rate eg  were  
per  cent  the  working  day  might  be  of        or  more  hours  It  would  indicate  that  the   
constituent  parts  of  the  working  day  necessarylabour  and  surplus  labour  time  were  equal  in 
extent but not how long each of these two constituent parts was  
The  working  day  is  thus  not  a  constant  but  a  variable  quantity  One  of  its  parts  certainly  is 
determined by the workingtime required for the reproduction of the labourpower of the labourer 
himself But its total amount varies with the duration of the surplus labour The working day is 
therefore determinable but is per se indeterminate 
Although the working day is not a fixed but a fluent quantity it can on the other hand only vary 
within certain limits The minimum limit is however not determinable of course if we make the 
extension line BC or the surplus labour   we have a minimum limit ie the part of the day 
which  the  labourer  must  necessarily  work  for  his  own  maintenance  On  the  basis  of  capitalist 
production however this necessary labour can form a part only of the working day the working 
day  itself  can  never  be  reduced  to  this  minimum  On  the  other  hand  the  working  day  has  a 
maximum  limit  It  cannot  be  prolonged  beyond  a  certain  point  This  maximum  limit  is 
conditioned by two things First by the physical bounds of labourpower Within the  hours of 
the  natural  day  a  man  can  expend  only  a  definite  quantity  of  his  vital  force  A  horse  in  like 
manner can only work from day to day  hours During part of the day this force must rest 
sleep during another part the man has to satisfy other physical needs to feed wash and clothe 
himself Besides these purely physical limitations the extension of the working day encounters 
moral ones The labourer needs time for satisfying his intellectual and social wants the extent and 
number of which are conditioned by the general state of social advancement The variation of the 
working  day  fluctuates  therefore  within  physical  and  social  bounds  But  both  these  limiting 

 

 

Chapter  
 
conditions are of a very elastic nature and allow the greatest latitude So we find working days of 
      hours ie of the most different lengths  
The capitalist has bought the labourpower at its dayrate To him its usevalue belongs during 
one working day He has thus acquired the right to make the labourer work for him during one 
day But what is a working day  
At all events less than a natural day By how much The capitalist has his own views of this 
ultima Thule the outermost limit the necessary limit of the working day As  capitalist he is 
only capital personified His soul is the soul of capital But capital has one single life impulse the 
tendency to create value and surplusvalue to make its constant factor the means of production 
absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus labour  
Capital is dead labour that vampirelike only lives by sucking living labour and lives the more 
the more labour it sucks The time during which the labourer works is the time during which the 
capitalist consumes the labourpower he has purchased of him  
If the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself he robs the capitalist  
The capitalist then takes his stand on the law of the exchange of commodities He like all other 
buyers seeks to get the greatest possible benefit out of the usevalue of his commodity Suddenly 
the  voice  of  the  labourer  which  had  been  stifled  in  the  storm  and  stress  of  the  process  of 
production rises  
The commodity that I have sold to you differs from the crowd of other commodities in that its 
use creates value and a value greater than its own That is why you bought it That which on your 
side appears a spontaneous expansion of capital is on mine extra expenditure of labourpower 
You  and  I  know  on  the  market  only  one  law  that  of  the  exchange  of  commodities  And  the 
consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts with it but to the buyer who 
acquires it To you therefore belongs the use of my daily labourpower But by means of the 
price that you pay for it each day I must be able to reproduce it daily and to sell it again Apart 
from natural exhaustion through age c I must be able on the morrow to work with the same 
normal amount of force health and freshness as today You preach to me constantly the gospel 
of saving and abstinence Good I will like a sensible saving owner husband my sole wealth 
labourpower and abstain from all foolish waste of it I will each day spend set in motion put 
into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration and healthy development 
By an unlimited extension of the working day you may in one day use up a quantity of labour
power greater than I can restore in three What you gain in labour I lose in substance The use of 
my labourpower and the spoliation of it are quite different things If the average time that doing 
a reasonable amount of work an average labourer can live is  years the value of my labour
power which you pay me from day to day is  or  of its total value But if you 
consume it in  years you pay me daily  instead of  of its total value ie only 
 of its daily value and you rob me therefore every day of  of the value of my commodity 
You  pay  me  for  one  days  labourpower  whilst  you  use  that  of    days  That  is  against  our 
contract and the law of exchanges I demand therefore a working day of normal length and I 
demand it without any appeal to your heart for in money matters sentiment is out of place You 
may  be  a  model  citizen  perhaps  a  member  of  the  Society  for  the  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to 
Animals and in the odour of sanctity to boot but the thing that you represent face to face with me 
has no heart in its breast That which seems to throb there is my own heartbeating I demand the 
normal working day because I like every other seller demand the value of my commodity  
We  see  then  that  apart  from  extremely  elastic  bounds  the  nature  of  the  exchange  of 
commodities itself imposes no limit to the working day no limit to surplus labour The capitalist 

 

 

Chapter  
 
maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible and 
to make whenever possible two working days out of one On the other hand the peculiar nature 
of  the  commodity  sold  implies  a  limit  to  its  consumption  by  the  purchaser  and  the  labourer 
maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal 
duration There is here therefore an antinomy right against right both equally bearing the seal 
of the law of exchanges Between equal rights force decides Hence is it that in the history of 
capitalist production the determination of what is a working day presents itself as the result of a 
struggle a struggle between collective capital ie the class of capitalists and collective labour 
ie the workingclass  

Section  The Greed for SurplusLabour Manufacturer and 

Boyard 

Capital has not invented surplus labour Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the 
means of production the labourer free or not free must add to the workingtime necessary for 
his own maintenance an extra workingtime in order to produce the means of subsistence for the 
owners  of  the  means  of  production  whether  this  proprietor  be  the  Athenian     
welltodo man Etruscan theocrat civis Romanus Roman citizen Norman baron American 
slaveowner Wallachian Boyard modern landlord or capitalist It is however clear that in any 
given  economic  formation  of  society  where  not  the  exchangevalue  but  the  usevalue  of  the 
product  predominates  surplus  labour  will  be  limited  by  a  given  set  of  wants  which  may  be 
greater or less and that here no boundless thirst for surplus labour arises from the nature of the 
production  itself  Hence  in  antiquity  overwork  becomes  horrible  only  when  the  object  is  to 
obtain  exchangevalue  in  its  specific  independent  moneyform  in  the  production  of  gold  and 
silver  Compulsory  working  to  death  is  here  the  recognised  form  of  overwork  Only  read 
Diodorus  Siculus  Still  these  are  exceptions  in  antiquity  But  as  soon  as  people  whose 
production still moves within the lower forms of slavelabour corvelabour c are drawn into 
the whirlpool of an international market dominated by the capitalistic mode of production the 
sale of their products for export becoming their principal interest the civilised horrors of over
work are grafted on the barbaric horrors of slavery serfdom c Hence the negro labour in the 
Southern States of the American Union preserved something of a patriarchal character so long as 
production was chiefly directed to immediate local consumption But in proportion as the export 
of cotton became of vital interest to these states the overworking of the negro and sometimes the 
using up of his life in  years of labour became a factor in a calculated and calculating system It 
was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products It was now 
a  question  of  production  of  surplus  labour  itself  So  was  it  also  with  the  corve  eg  in  the 
Danubian Principalities now Roumania  
The  comparison  of  the  greed  for  surplus  labour  in  the  Danubian  Principalities  with  the  same 
greed  in  English  factories  has  a  special  interest  because  surplus  labour  in  the  corve  has  an 
independent and palpable form  
Suppose the working day consists of  hours of necessary labour and  hours of surplus labour 
Then the free labourer gives the capitalist every week  x  or  hours of surplus labour It is the 
same  as  if  he  worked    days  in  the  week  for  himself  and    days  in  the  week  gratis  for  the 
capitalist But this is not evident on the surface Surplus labour and necessary labour glide one 
into the other I can therefore express the same relationship by saying eg that the labourer in 
every minute works  seconds for himself and  for the capitalist etc It is otherwise with the 
corve  The  necessary  labour  which  the  Wallachian  peasant  does  for  his  own  maintenance  is 

 

 

Chapter  
 
distinctly marked off from his surplus labour on behalf of the Boyard The one he does on his 
own  field  the  other  on  the  seignorial  estate  Both  parts  of  the  labourtime  exist  therefore 
independently  side  by  side  one  with  the  other  In  the  corve  the  surplus  labour  is  accurately 
marked off from the necessary labour This however can make no difference with regard to the 
quantitative relation of surplus labour to necessary labour Three days surplus labour in the week 
remain three days that yield no equivalent to the labourer himself whether it be called corve or 
wagelabour But in the capitalist the greed for surplus labour appears in the straining after an 
unlimited extension of the working day in the Boyard more simply in a direct hunting after days 
of corve  
In  the  Danubian  Principalities  the  corve  was  mixed  up  with  rents  in  kind  and  other 
appurtenances  of  bondage  but  it  formed  the  most  important  tribute  paid  to  the  ruling  class 
Where this was the case the corve rarely arose from serfdom serfdom much more frequently on 
the other hand took origin from the corve This is what took place in the Roumanian provinces 
Their original mode of production was based on community of the soil but not in the Slavonic or 
Indian  form  Part  of  the  land  was  cultivated  in  severalty  as  freehold  by  the  members  of  the 
community another part  ager publicus  was cultivated by them in common The products of 
this  common  labour  served  partly  as  a  reserve  fund  against  bad  harvests  and  other  accidents 
partly as a public store for providing the costs of war religion and other common expenses In 
course of time military and clerical dignitaries usurped along with the common land the labour 
spent upon it The labour of the free peasants on their common land was transformed into corve 
for  the  thieves  of  the  common  land  This  corve  soon  developed  into  a  servile  relationship 
existing in point of fact not in point of law until Russia the liberator of the world made it legal 
under  presence  of  abolishing  serfdom  The  code  of  the  corve  which  the  Russian  General 
Kisseleff proclaimed  in   was of course  dictated  by  the  Boyards themselves Thus  Russia 
conquered with one blow the magnates of the Danubian provinces and the applause of liberal 
cretins throughout Europe  
According to the Rglement organique as this code of the corve is called every Wallachian 
peasant owes to the socalled landlord besides a mass of detailed payments in kind   days 
of general labour  one day of field labour  one day of wood carrying In all  days in the 
year  With  deep  insight  into  Political  Economy  however  the  working  day  is  not  taken  in  its 
ordinary sense but as the working day necessary to the production of an average daily product 
and that average daily product is determined in so crafty a way that no Cyclops would be done 
with it in  hours In dry words the Rglement itself declares with true Russian irony that by  
working days one must understand the product of the manual labour of  days by  day of field 
labour    days  and  by    day  of  wood  carrying  in  like  manner  three  times  as much  In  all   
corve  days  To  this  had  to  be  added  the  socalled  jobagie  service  due  to  the  lord  for 
extraordinary occasions In proportion to the size of its population every village has to furnish 
annually a definite contingent to the jobagie This additional corve is estimated at  days for 
each Wallachian peasant Thus the prescribed corve amounts to  working days yearly But the 
agricultural year in Wallachia numbers in consequence of the severe climate only  days of 
which  for Sundays and holidays  on an average for bad weather together  days do not 
count  working days remain The ratio of the corve to the necessary labour  or   
 gives a much smaller rate of surplusvalue than that which regulates the labour of the English 
agricultural or factory labourer This is however only the legally prescribed corve And in a 
spirit yet more liberal than the English Factory Acts the Rglement organique has known 
how to facilitate its own evasion After it has made  days out of  the nominal days work of 
each of the  corve days is again so arranged that a portion of it must fall on the ensuing day In

plantations needs twice as much time The legal days work for some kinds of agricultural labour 
is  interpretable  in  such  a  way  that  the  day  begins  in  May  and  ends  in  October  In  Moldavia 
conditions are still harder 
The  corve days of the Rglement organique cried a Boyard drunk with victory amount to 
 days in the year  
If the Rglement organique of the Danubian provinces was a positive expression of the greed for 
surplus  labour  which  every  paragraph  legalised  the  English  Factory  Acts  are  the  negative 
expression of the same greed These acts curb the passion of capital for a limitless draining of 
labourpower by forcibly limiting the working day by state regulations made by a state that is 
ruled by capitalistand landlord Apart from the workingclass movement that daily grew more 
threatening the limiting of factory labour was dictated by the same necessity which spread guano 
over the English fields The same blind eagerness for plunder that in the one case exhausted the 
soil had in the other torn up by the roots the living force of the nation Periodical epidemics 
speak on this point as clearly as the diminishing military standard in Germany and France  
The Factory Act of  now in force  allows for the average working day  hours ie 
for the first  days  hours from  am to  pm including  an hour for breakfast and an hour 
for dinner and thus leaving  workinghours and  hours for Saturday from  am to  pm 
of which  an hour is subtracted for breakfast  workinghours are left  for each of the first 
 days  for the last  
Certain  guardians  of  these  laws  are  appointed  Factory  Inspectors  directly  under  the  Home 
Secretary whose reports are published halfyearly by order of Parliament They give regular and 
official statistics of the capitalistic greed for surplus labour  
Let us listen for a moment to the Factory Inspectors  

The fraudulent millowner begins work a quarter of an hour sometimes more 
sometimes less before  am and leaves off a quarter of an hour sometimes 
more sometimes less after  pm He takes  minutes from the beginning and 
from the end of the half hour nominally allowed for breakfast and  minutes at 
the beginning and end of the hour nominally allowed for dinner He works for a 
quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less after  pm on Saturday 
Thus his gain is  

Before  am 
After  pm  
At breakfast time  
At dinner time  

On Saturday before  am 
At breakfast time 
After  pm 
 
Total weekly  

Five days   minutes 

 minutes 
  
  
  
  
 minutes 
  
  
 minutes 
 minutes 

Or  hours and  minutes weekly which multiplied by  working weeks in the 
year allowing two for holidays and occasional stoppages is equal to  working 
days 

 

 

 

Chapter  

Five minutes a days increased work multiplied by weeks are equal to two and a 
half days of produce in the year  
An additional hour a day gained by small instalments before  am after  pm 
and at the beginning and end of the times nominally fixed for meals is nearly 
equivalent to working  months in the year  

Crises during which production is interrupted and the factories work short time ie for only a 
part  of  the  week  naturally  do  not  affect  the  tendency  to  extend  the  working  day  The  less 
business there is the more profit has to be made on the business done The less time spent in 
work the more of that time has to be turned into surplus labourtime  
Thus the Factory Inspectors report on the period of the crisis from  to   

It may seem inconsistent that there should be any overworking at a time when 
trade is so bad but that very badness leads to the transgression by unscrupulous 
men they get the extra profit of it  In the last half year says Leonard Horner 
 mills in my district have been given up  were found standing yet over
work is continued beyond the legal hours  
For a great part of the time says Mr Howell owing to the depression of trade 
many factories were altogether closed and a still greater number were working 
short time I continue however to receive about the usual number of complaints 
that half or threequarters of an hour in the day are snatched from the workers by 
encroaching upon the times professedly allowed for rest and refreshment  

The same phenomenon was reproduced on a smaller scale during the frightful cottoncrises from 
 to   

It is sometimes advanced by way of excuse when persons are found at work in a 
factory either at a meal hour or at some illegal time that they will not leave the 
mill at the appointed hour and that compulsion is necessary to force them to cease 
work cleaning their machinery c especially on Saturday afternoons But if 
the hands remain in a factory after the machinery has ceased to revolve  they 
would not have been so employed if sufficient time had been set apart specially 
for cleaning c either before  am sic or before  pm on Saturday 
afternoons  
The profit to be gained by it overworking in violation of the Act appears to be 
to many a greater temptation than they can resist they calculate upon the chance 
of not being found out and when they see the small amount of penalty and costs 
which those who have been convicted have had to pay they find that if they 
should be detected there will still be a considerable balance of gain  In cases 
where the additional time is gained by a multiplication of small thefts in the 
course of the day there are insuperable difficulties to the inspectors making out a 
case  

These  small  thefts  of  capital  from  the  labourers  meal  and  recreation  time  the  factory 
inspectors also designate as petty pilferings of minutes  snatching a few minutes or as 
the labourers technically called them nibbling and cribbling at mealtimes  
It is evident that in this atmosphere the formation of surplusvalue by surplus labour is no secret 

If you allow me said a highly respectable master to me to work only ten 
minutes in the day overtime you put one thousand a year in my pocket 
Moments are the elements of profit  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Nothing is from this point of view more characteristic than the designation of the workers who 
work full time as fulltimers and the children under  who are only allowed to work  hours 
as halftimers The worker is here nothing more than personified labourtime All individual 
distinctions are merged in those of fulltimers and halftimers  
Section  Branches of English Industry Without Legal Limits 

to Exploitation 

We have hitherto considered the tendency to the extension of the working day the werewolfs 
hunger for surplus labour in a department where the monstrous exactions not surpassed says an 
English  bourgeois  economist  by  the  cruelties  of  the  Spaniards  to  the  American  redskins 
caused capital at last to be bound by the chains of legal regulations Now let us cast a glance at 
certain branches of production in which the exploitation of labour is either free from fetters to this 
day or was so yesterday 

Mr Broughton Charlton county magistrate declared as chairman of a meeting 
held at the Assembly Rooms Nottingham on the th January  that there 
was an amount of privation and suffering among that portion of the population 
connected with the lace trade unknown in other parts of the kingdom indeed in 
the civilised world  Children of nine or ten years are dragged from their squalid 
beds at two three or four oclock in the morning and compelled to work for a 
bare subsistence until ten eleven or twelve at night their limbs wearing away 
their frames dwindling their faces whitening and their humanity absolutely 
sinking into a stonelike torpor utterly horrible to contemplate We are not 
surprised that Mr Mallett or any other manufacturer should stand forward and 
protest against discussion The system as the Rev Montagu Valpy describes it 
is one of unmitigated slavery socially physically morally and spiritually 
What can be thought of a town which holds a public meeting to petition that the 
period of labour for men shall be diminished to eighteen hours a day  We 
declaim against the Virginian and Carolinian cottonplanters Is their black
market their lash and their barter of human flesh more detestable than this slow 
sacrifice of humanity which takes place in order that veils and collars may be 
fabricated for the benefit of capitalists  

The  potteries  of  Staffordshire  have  during  the  last    years  been  the  subject  of  three 
parliamentary  inquiries  The  result  is  embodied  in  Mr  Scrivens  Report  of    to  the 
Childrens Employment Commissioners in the report of Dr Greenhow of  published by 
order of the medical officer of the Privy Council Public Health rd Report  lastly in 
the report of Mr Longe of  in the First Report of the Childrens Employment Commission 
of the th June  For my purpose it is enough to take from the reports of  and  
some  depositions  of  the  exploited  children  themselves  From  the  children  we  may  form  an 
opinion as to the adults especially the girls and women and that in a branch of industry by the 
side of which cottonspinning appears an agreeable and healthful occupation  
William Wood  years old was  years and  months when he began to work He ran moulds 
carried readymoulded articles into the dryingroom afterwards bringing back the empty mould

Dr Greenhow states that the average duration of life in the pottery districts of StokeonTrent 
and  Wolstanton  is  extraordinarily  short  Although  in  the  district  of  Stoke  only    and  in 
Wolstanton  only    of  the  adult  male  population  above    are  employed  in  the  potteries 
among the men of that age in the first district more than half in the second nearly  of the 
whole deaths are the result of pulmonary diseases among the potters Dr Boothroyd a medical 
practitioner at Hanley says 
Each successive generation of potters is more dwarfed and less robust than the preceding one  
In like manner another doctor Mr MBean 

Since he began to practice among the potters  years ago he had observed a 
marked degeneration especially shown in diminution of stature and breadth 

These statements are taken from the report of Dr Greenhow in   
From the report of the Commissioners in  the following Dr J T Arledge senior physician 
of the North Staffordshire Infirmary says 

The potters as a class both men and women represent a degenerated population 
both physically and morally They are as a rule stunted in growth illshaped and 
frequently illformed in the chest they become prematurely old and are certainly 
shortlived they are phlegmatic and bloodless and exhibit their debility of 
constitution by obstinate attacks of dyspepsia and disorders of the liver and 
kidneys and by rheumatism But of all diseases they are especially prone to chest
disease to pneumonia phthisis bronchitis and asthma One form would appear 
peculiar to them and is known as potters asthma or potters consumption 
Scrofula attacking the glands or bones or other parts of the body is a disease of 
twothirds or more of the potters  That the degenerescence of the population 
of this district is not even greater than it is is due to the constant recruiting from 
the adjacent country and intermarriages with more healthy races  

Mr  Charles  Parsons  late  house  surgeon  of  the  same  institution  writes  in  a  letter  to 
Commissioner Longe amongst other things 

I can only speak from personal observation and not from statistical data but I do 
not hesitate to assert that my indignation has been aroused again and again at the 
sight of poor children whose health has been sacrificed to gratify the avarice of 
either parents or employers He enumerates the causes of the diseases of the 
potters and sums them up in the phrase long hours The report of the 
Commission trusts that a manufacture which has assumed so prominent a place 
in the whole world will not long be subject to the remark that its great success is 
accompanied with the physical deterioration widespread bodily suffering and 
early death of the workpeople  by whose labour and skill such great results have 
been achieved  

And all that holds of the potteries in England is true of those in Scotland

The  manufacture  of  lucifer  matches  dates  from    from  the  discovery  of  the  method  of 
applying phosphorus to the match itself Since  this manufacture has rapidly developed in 
England and has extended especially amongst the thickly populated parts of London as well as in 
Manchester  Birmingham  Liverpool  Bristol  Norwich  Newcastle  and  Glasgow  With  it  has 
spread the form of lockjaw which a Vienna physician in  discovered to be a disease peculiar 
to lucifermatchmakers Half the workers are children under thirteen and young persons under 
eighteen  The  manufacture  is  on  account  of  its  unhealthiness  and  unpleasantness  in  such  bad 
odour that only the most miserable part of the labouring class halfstarved widows and so forth 
deliver up their children to it the ragged halfstarved untaught children

pestilent with phosphorus Dante would have found the worst horrors of his Inferno surpassed in

In the manufacture of paperhangings the coarser sorts are printed by machine the finer by hand

of April During this time the work goes on fast and furious without intermission from  am to 
 pm or further into the night  
J Leach deposes 

Last winter six out of nineteen girls were away from illhealth at one time from 
overwork I have to bawl at them to keep them awake W Duffy I have seen 
when the children could none of them keep their eyes open for the work indeed 
none of us could J Lightbourne Am   We worked last winter till  
evening and the winter before till  I used to cry with sore feet every night last 
winter G Apsden That boy of mine when he was  years old I used to carry 
him on my back to and fro through the snow and he used to have  hours a day 
 I have often knelt down to feed him as he stood by the machine for he could 
not leave it or stop Smith the managing partner of a Manchester factory We 
he means his hands who work for us work on with no stoppage for meals so 
that days work of  hours is finished by  pm and all after that is over
time Does this Mr Smith take no meals himself during  hours We this 
same Smith seldom leave off working before  pm he means leave off the 
consumption of our labourpower machines so that we iterum Crispinus are 
really working overtime the whole year round For all these children and adults 
alike  children and young persons and  adults the average work for the 
last  months has been at the very least  days  hours or   hours a week 
For the six weeks ending May nd this year  the average was higher   
days or  hours a week  

Still this same Mr Smith who is so extremely devoted to the pluralis majestatis the Royal we 
ie speaking on behalf of his subjects adds with a smile Machinework is not great So the 
employers in the blockprinting say Hand labour is more healthy than machine work On the 
whole manufacturers declare with indignation against the proposal to stop the machines at least 
during mealtimes  

A clause says Mr Otley manager of a wallpaper factory in the Borough 
which allowed work between say  am and  pm in would suit us  very 
well but the factory hours  am to  pm are not suitable Our machine is 
always stopped for dinner What generosity There is no waste of paper and 

 

 

 

Chapter  

colour to speak of But he adds sympathetically I can understand the loss of 
time not being liked  

The report of the Commission opines with navet that the fear of some leading firms of losing 
time  ie  the  time  for  appropriating  the  labour  of  others  and  thence  losing  profit  is  not  a 
sufficient reason for allowing children under  and young persons under  working  to  
hours per day to lose their dinner nor for giving it to them as coal and water are supplied to the 
steamengine soap to wool oil to the wheel  as merely auxiliary material to the instruments of 
labour during the process of production itself  
No branch of industry in England we do not take into account the making of bread by machinery 
recently introduced has preserved up to the present day a method of production so archaic so  
as we see from the poets of the Roman Empire  prechristian as baking But capital as was said 
earlier is at first indifferent as to the technical character of the labourprocess it begins by taking 
it just as it finds it  
The incredible adulteration of bread especially in London was first revealed by the House of 
Commons Committee on the adulteration of articles of food  and Dr Hassalls work 
Adulterations  detected    The  consequence  of  these  revelations  was  the  Act  of  August  th 
  for  preventing  the  adulteration  of  articles  of  food  and  drink  an  inoperative  law  as  it 
naturally shows the tenderest consideration for every Freetrader who determines by the buying 
or  selling  of  adulterated  commodities  to  turn  an  honest  penny  The  Committee  itself 
formulated  more  or  less  navely  its  conviction  that  Freetrade  meant  essentially  trade  with 
adulterated  or  as  the  English  ingeniously  put  it  sophisticated  goods  In  fact  this  kind  of 
sophistry knows better than Protagoras how to make white black and black white and better than 
the  Eleatics  how  to  demonstrate  ad  oculos  before  your  own  eyes  that  everything  is  only 
appearance  
At  all  events  the  Committee  had  directed  the  attention  of  the  public  to  its  daily  bread  and 
therefore to the baking trade At the same time in public meetings and in petitions to Parliament 
rose the cry of the London journeymen bakers against their overwork c The cry was so urgent 
that Mr H S Tremenheere also a member of the Commission of  several times mentioned 
was appointed Royal Commissioner of Inquiry His report   together with the evidence given 
roused not the heart of the public but its stomach Englishmen always well up in the Bible knew 
well  enough  that  man  unless  by  elective  grace  a  capitalist  or  landlord  or  sinecurist  is 
commanded to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow but they did not know that he had to eat 
daily in his bread a certain quantity of human perspiration mixed with the discharge of abscesses 
cobwebs dead blackbeetles and putrid German yeast without counting alum sand and other 
agreeable  mineral  ingredients  Without  any  regard  to  his  holiness  Freetrade  the  free  baking
trade  was  therefore  placed  under  the  supervision  of  the  State  inspectors  Close  of  the 
Parliamentary session of  and by the same Act of Parliament work from  in the evening to 
 in the morning was forbidden for journeymen bakers under  The last clause speaks volumes 
as to the overwork in this oldfashioned homely line of business 

The work of a London journeyman baker begins as a rule at about eleven at 
night At that hour he makes the dough  a laborious process which lasts from 
half an hour to three quarters of an hour according to the size of the batch or the 
labour bestowed upon it He then lies down upon the kneadingboard which is 
also the covering of the trough in which the dough is made and with a sack 
under him and another rolled up as a pillow he sleeps for about a couple of 
hours He is then engaged in a rapid and continuous labour for about five hours  
throwing out the dough scaling it off moulding it putting it into the oven 

 

 

 

Chapter  

preparing and baking rolls and fancy bread taking the batch bread out of the oven 
and up into the shop c c The temperature of a bakehouse ranges from about 
 to upwards of  degrees and in the smaller bakehouses approximates usually 
to the higher rather than to the lower degree of heat When the business of making 
the bread rolls c is over that of its distribution begins and a considerable 
proportion of the journeymen in the trade after working hard in the manner 
described during the night are upon their legs for many hours during the day 
carrying baskets or wheeling handcarts and sometimes again in the bakehouse 
leaving off work at various hours between  and  pm according to the season of 
the year or the amount and nature of their masters business while others are 
again engaged in the bakehouse in bringing out more batches until late in the 
afternoon  During what is called the London season the operatives 
belonging to the fullpriced bakers at the West End of the town generally begin 
work at  pm and are engaged in making the bread with one or two short 
sometimes very short intervals of rest up to  oclock the next morning They 
are then engaged all day long up to    and as late as  oclock in the evening 
carrying out bread or sometimes in the afternoon in the bakehouse again 
assisting in the biscuitbaking They may have after they have done their work 
sometimes five or six sometimes only four or five hours sleep before they begin 
again On Fridays they always begin sooner some about ten oclock and continue 
in some cases at work either in making or delivering the bread up to  pm on 
Saturday night but more generally up to  or  oclock Sunday morning On 
Sundays the men must attend twice or three times during the day for an hour or 
two to make preparations for the next days bread The men employed by the 
underselling masters who sell their bread under the full price and who as 
already pointed out comprise threefourths of the London bakers have not only 
to work on the average longer hours but their work is almost entirely confined to 
the bakehouse The underselling masters generally sell their bread in the shop If 
they send it out which is not common except as supplying chandlers shops they 
usually employ other hands for that purpose It is not their practice to deliver 
bread from house to house Towards the end of the week  the men begin on 
Thursday night at  oclock and continue on with only slight intermission until 
late on Saturday evening  

Even the bourgeois intellect understands the position of the underselling masters The unpaid 
labour  of the  men  was  made  the source  whereby  the  competition  was carried on    And  the 
fullpriced  baker  denounces  his  underselling  competitors  to  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  as 
thieves of foreign labour and adulterators 

They only exist now by first defrauding the public and next getting  hours 
work out of their men for  hours wages  

The adulteration of bread and the formation of a class of bakers that sells the bread below the full 
price date from the beginning of the th century from the time when the corporate character of 
the trade  was lost  and  the  capitalist in  the  form  of  the  miller  or flourfactor  rises  behind the 
nominal master baker Thus was laid the foundation of capitalistic production in this trade of 
the  unlimited  extension  of  the  working  day  and  of  nightlabour  although  the latter  only  since 
 gained a serious footing even in London  
After what has just been said it will be understood that the Report of the Commission classes 
journeymen  bakers  among  the  shortlived  labourers  who  having  by  good  luck  escaped  the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
normal decimation of the children of the workingclass rarely reach the age of  Nevertheless 
the  baking  trade  is  always  overwhelmed  with  applicants  The  sources  of  the  supply  of  these 
labourpowers  to  London  are  Scotland  the  western  agricultural  districts  of  England  and 
Germany  
In  the  years    the  journeymen  bakers  in  Ireland  organised  at  their  own  expense  great 
meetings to agitate against night and Sunday work The public  eg at the Dublin meeting in 
May   took their part with Irish warmth As a result of this movement daylabour alone 
was successfully established in Wexford Kilkenny Clonmel Waterford c  

In Limerick where the grievances of the journeymen are demonstrated to be 
excessive the movement has been defeated by the opposition of the master 
bakers the miller bakers being the greatest opponents The example of Limerick 
led to a retrogression in Ennis and Tipperary In Cork where the strongest 
possible demonstration of feeling took place the masters by exercising their 
power of turning the men out of employment have defeated the movement In 
Dublin the master bakers have offered the most determined opposition to the 
movement and by discountenancing as much as possible the journeymen 
promoting it have succeeded in leading the men into acquiescence in Sunday 
work and nightwork contrary to the convictions of the men  

The Committee of the English Government which Government in Ireland is armed to the teeth 
and  generally  knows  how  to  show  it  remonstrates  in  mild  though  funereal  tones  with  the 
implacable master bakers of Dublin Limerick Cork c  

The Committee believe that the hours of labour are limited by natural laws 
which cannot be violated with impunity That for master bakers to induce their 
workmen by the fear of losing employment to violate their religious convictions 
and their better feelings to disobey the laws of the land and to disregard public 
opinion this all refers to Sunday labour is calculated to provoke illfeeling 
between workmen and masters  and affords an example dangerous to religion 
morality and social order The Committee believe that any constant work 
beyond  hours aday encroaches on the domestic and private life of the 
workingman and so leads to disastrous moral results interfering with each mans 
home and the discharge of his family duties as a son a brother a husband a 
father That work beyond  hours has a tendency to undermine the health of the 
workingman and so leads to premature old age and death to the great injury of 
families of workingmen thus deprived of the care and support of the head of the 
family when most required  

So far we have dealt with Ireland On the other side of the channel in Scotland the agricultural 
labourer the ploughman protests against his  hours work in the most inclement climate 
with  hours additional work on Sunday in this land of Sabbatarians   whilst at the same 
time three railway men are standing before a London coroners jury  a guard an enginedriver 
a  signalman  A  tremendous  railway  accident  has  hurried  hundreds  of  passengers  into  another 
world The  negligence  of the  employee  is  the  cause  of  the  misfortune They  declare  with  one 
voice before the jury that ten or twelve years before their labour only lasted eight hours aday 
During the last five or six years it had been screwed up to   and  hours and under a 
specially severe pressure of holidaymakers at times of excursion trains it often lasted for  or 
 hours without a break They were ordinary men not Cyclops At a certain point their labour
power failed Torpor seized them Their brain ceased to think their eyes to see The thoroughly 
respectable British jurymen answered by a verdict that sent them to the next assizes on a charge 
 

 

Chapter  
 
of  manslaughter  and  in  a  gentle  rider  to  their  verdict  expressed  the  pious  hope  that  the 
capitalistic magnates of the railways would in future be more extravagant in the purchase of a 
sufficient quantity of labourpower and more abstemious more selfdenying more thrifty 
in the draining of paid labourpower  
From the motley crowd of labourers of all callings ages sexes that press on us more busily than 
the souls of the slain on Ulysses on whom  without referring to the Blue books under their arms 
 we see at a glance the mark of overwork let us take two more figures whose striking contrast 
proves that before capital all men are alike  a milliner and a blacksmith  
In  the  last  week  of  June    all  the  London  daily  papers  published  a  paragraph  with  the 
sensational  heading  Death from  simple  overwork  It  dealt  with the  death of the  milliner 
Mary  Anne  Walkley    years  of  age  employed  in  a  highlyrespectable  dressmaking 
establishment exploited by a lady with the pleasant name of Elise The old oftentold story   
was once more recounted This girl worked on an average  hours during the season often  
hours  without  a  break  whilst  her  failing  labourpower  was  revived  by  occasional  supplies  of 
sherry port or coffee It was just now the height of the season It was necessary to conjure up in 
the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the noble ladies bidden to the ball in honour of 
the newlyimported Princess of Wales Mary Anne Walkley had worked without intermission for 
 hours with  other girls  in one room that only afforded  of the cubic feet of air 
required for them At night they slept in pairs in one of the stifling holes into which the bedroom 
was divided by partitions of board And this was one of the best millinery establishments in 
London Mary Anne Walkley fell ill on the Friday died on Sunday without to the astonishment 
of Madame Elise having previously completed the work in hand The doctor Mr Keys called 
too late to the deathbed duly bore witness before the coroners jury that  

Mary Anne Walkley had died from long hours of work in an overcrowded work
room and a too small and badly ventilated bedroom  

In order to give the doctor a lesson in good manners the coroners jury thereupon brought in a 
verdict that 

the deceased had died of apoplexy but there was reason to fear that her death 
had been accelerated by overwork in an overcrowded workroom c 

Our white slaves cried the Morning Star the organ of the Freetraders Cobden and Bright 
our white slaves who are toiled into the grave for the most part silently pine and die  
It is not in dressmakers rooms that working to death is the order of the day but 
in a thousand other places in every place I had almost said where a thriving 
business has to be done We will take the blacksmith as a type If the poets 
were true there is no man so hearty so merry as the blacksmith he rises early 
and strikes his sparks before the sun he eats and drinks and sleeps as no other 
man Working in moderation he is in fact in one of the best of human positions 
physically speaking But we follow him into the city or town and we see the 
stress of work on that strong man and what then is his position in the deathrate of 
his country In Marylebone blacksmiths die at the rate of  per thousand per 
annum or  above the mean of the male adults of the country in its entirety The 
occupation instinctive almost as a portion of human art unobjectionable as a 
branch of human industry is made by mere excess of work the destroyer of the 
man He can strike so many blows per day walk so many steps breathe so many 
breaths produce so much work and live an average say of fifty years he is made 
to strike so many more blows to walk so many more steps to breathe so many

more breaths per day and to increase altogether a fourth of his life He meets the 
effort the result is that producing for a limited time a fourth more work he dies

Section  Day and Night Work The Relay System 

Constant  capital  the  means  of  production  considered  from  the  standpoint  of  the  creation  of 
surplusvalue only exist to absorb labour and with every drop of labour a proportional quantity 
of  surplus labour  While  they  fail to  do  this  their mere  existence causes a relative  loss to the 
capitalist for they represent during the time they lie fallow a useless advance of capital And this 
loss becomes positive and absolute as soon as the intermission of their employment necessitates 
additional outlay at the recommencement of work The prolongation of the working day beyond 
the limits of the natural day into the night only acts as a palliative It quenches only in a slight 
degree the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour To appropriate labour during all the  
hours of the day is therefore the inherent tendency of capitalist production But as it is physically 
impossible to exploit the same individual labourpower constantly during the night as well as the 
day  to  overcome  this  physical  hindrance  an  alternation  becomes  necessary  between  the 
workpeople  whose  powers  are  exhausted  by  day  and  those  who  are  used  up  by  night  This 
alternation may be effected in various ways eg it may be so arranged that part of the workers 
are one week employed on daywork the next week on nightwork  It is well known that this 
relay system this alternation of two sets of workers held full sway in the fullblooded youthtime 
of the English cotton manufacture and that at the present time it still flourishes among others in 
the cotton spinning of the Moscow district This  hours process of production exists today as 
a system in many of the branches of industry of Great Britain that are still free in the blast
furnaces  forges  platerolling  mills  and  other  metallurgical  establishments  in England  Wales 
and  Scotland  The  workingtime  here  includes  besides  the    hours  of  the    working  days  a 
great part also of the  hours of Sunday The workers consist of men and women adults and 
children of both sexes The ages of the children and young persons run through all intermediate 
grades from  in some cases from  to   
In  some  branches  of  industry  the  girls  and  women  work  through  the  night  together  with  the 
males  
Placing on one side the generally injurious influence of nightlabour the duration of the process 
of production unbroken during the  hours offers very welcome opportunities of exceeding the 
limits of the normal working day eg in the branches of industry already mentioned which are 
of an exceedingly fatiguing nature the official working day means for each worker usually  
hours by night or day But the overwork beyond this amount is in many cases to use the words 
of the English official report truly fearful  

It is impossible the report continues for any mind to realise the amount of 
work described in the following passages as being performed by boys of from  to 
 years of age  without coming irresistibly to the conclusion that such abuses of 
the power of parents and of employers can no longer be allowed to exist  
The practice of boys working at all by day and night turns either in the usual 
course of things or at pressing times seems inevitably to open the door to their 
not unfrequently working unduly long hours These hours are indeed in some 
cases not only cruelly but even incredibly long for children Amongst a number 
of boys it will of course not unfrequently happen that one or more are from some 
cause absent When this happens their place is made up by one or more boys 

 

 

 

Chapter  

who work in the other turn That this is a well understood system is plain  from 
the answer of the manager of some large rollingmills who when I asked him 
how the place of the boys absent from their turn was made up I daresay sir you 
know that as well as I do and admitted the fact  
At a rollingmill where the proper hours were from  am to  pm a boy 
worked about four nights every week till  pm at least  and this for six 
months Another at  years old sometimes made three hour shifts running 
and when  has made two days and two nights running A third now   
worked from  am till  pm three nights and till  pm the other nights 
Another now   worked from  pm till  noon next day for a week 
together and sometimes for three shifts together eg from Monday morning till 
Tuesday night Another now  has worked in an iron foundry at Stavely from 
 am till  pm for a fortnight on end could not do it any more George 
Allinsworth age  came here as cellarboy last Friday next morning we had to 
begin at  so I stopped here all night Live five miles off Slept on the floor of the 
furnace over head with an apron under me and a bit of a jacket over me The two 
other days I have been here at  am Aye it is hot in here Before I came here I 
was nearly a year at the same work at some works in the country Began there 
too at  on Saturday morning  always did but was very gain near home and 
could sleep at home Other days I began at  in the morning and gien over at  or 
 in the evening c  

Let  us  now  hear  how  capital  itself  regards  this    hours  system  The  extreme  forms  of  the 
system its abuse in the cruel and incredible extension of the working day are naturally passed 
over in silence Capital only speaks of the system in its normal form  
Messrs  Naylor    Vickers  steel  manufacturers  who  employ  between    and    persons 
among whom only  per cent are under  and of those only  boys under  work in night 
sets thus express themselves 

The boys do not suffer from the heat The temperature is probably from  to 
 At the forges and in the rolling mills the hands work night and day in 
relays but all the other parts of the work are daywork ie from  am to  pm 
In the forge the hours are from  to  Some of the hands always work in the 
night without any alternation of day and night work We do not find any 
difference in the health of those who work regularly by night and those who work 
by day and probably people can sleep better if they have the same period of rest 
than if it is changed About  of the boys under the age of  work in the night 
sets We could not well do without lads under  working by night The 
objection would be the increase in the cost of production Skilled hands and the 
heads in every department are difficult to get but of lads we could get any 
number But from the small proportion of boys that we employ the subject ie 
of restrictions on nightwork is of little importance or interest to us  

Mr J Ellis one of the firm of Messrs John Brown  Co steel and iron works employing about 
 men and boys part of whose operations namely iron and heavier steel work goes on night 
and day by relays states that in the heavier steel work one or two boys are employed to a score 
or two men Their concern employs upwards of  boys under  of whom about  or  
are under the age of  With reference to the proposed alteration of the law Mr Ellis says 

I do not think it would be very objectionable to require that no person under the 
age of  should work more than  hours in the  But we do not think that any 

 

 

 

Chapter  

line could be drawn over the age of  at which boys could be dispensed with for 
nightwork But we would sooner be prevented from employing boys under the 
age of  or even so high as  at all than not be allowed to employ boys that 
we do have at night Those boys who work in the day sets must take their turn in 
the night sets also because the men could not work in the night sets only it would 
ruin their health We think however that nightwork in alternate weeks is no 
harm  

Messrs Naylor  Vickers on the other hand in conformity with the interest of their business 
considered that periodically changed nightlabour might possibly do more harm than continual 
nightlabour 

We find the men who do it as well as the others who do other work only by 
day Our objections to not allowing boys under  to work at night would be on 
account of the increase of expense but this is the only reason 
What cynical navet We think that the increase would be more than the trade 
with due regard to its being successfully carried out could fairly bear What 
mealymouthed phraseology Labour is scarce here and might fall short if there 
were such a regulation ie Ellis Brown  Co might fall into the fatal 
perplexity of being obliged to pay labourpower its full value  

The  Cyclops  Steel  and  Iron  Works  of  Messrs  Cammell    Co  are  concocted  on  the  same 
large  scale  as  those  of  the  abovementioned  John  Brown    Co  The  managing  director  had 
handed in his evidence to the Government Commissioner Mr White in writing Later he found it 
convenient  to  suppress  the  MS  when  it  had  been  returned  to  him  for  revision  Mr  White 
however  has  a  good  memory  He  remembered  quite  clearly  that  for  the  Messrs  Cyclops  the 
forbidding of the nightlabour of children and young persons would be impossible it would be 
tantamount to stopping their works and yet their business employs little more than  of boys 
under  and less than  under   
On the same subject Mr E F Sanderson of the firm of Sanderson Bros  Co steel rolling
mills and forges Attercliffe says 

Great difficulty would be caused by preventing boys under  from working at 
night The chief would be the increase of cost from employing men instead of 
boys I cannot say what this would be but probably it would not be enough to 
enable the manufacturers to raise the price of steel and consequently it would fall 
on them as of course the men what queerheaded folk would refuse to pay it 

Mr Sanderson does not know how much he pays the children but 

perhaps the younger boys get from s to s a week The boys work is of a 
kind for which the strength of the boys is generally generally of course not 
always quite sufficient and consequently there would be no gain in the greater 
strength of the men to counterbalance the loss or it would be only in the few cases 
in which the metal is heavy The men would not like so well not to have boys 
under them as men would be less obedient Besides boys must begin young to 
learn the trade Leaving daywork alone open to boys would not answer this 
purpose  

And why not Why could not boys learn their handicraft in the daytime Your reason 

Owing to the men working days and nights in alternate weeks the men would be 
separated half the time from their boys and would lose half the profit which they 
make from them The training which they give to an apprentice is considered as 

 

 

 

Chapter  

part of the return for the boys labour and thus enables the man to get it at a 
cheaper rate Each man would want half of this profit  

In other words Messrs Sanderson would have to pay part of the wages of the adult men out of 
their own pockets instead of by the nightwork of the boys Messrs Sandersons profit would thus 
fall  to  some  extent  and  this  is  the  good  Sandersonian  reason  why  boys  cannot  learn  their 
handicraft  in  the  day  In  addition  to  this  it  would  throw  nightlabour  on  those  who  worked 
instead of the boys which they would not be able to stand The difficulties in fact would be so 
great that they would very likely lead to the giving up of nightwork altogether and as far as the 
work  itself  is  concerned  says  E  F  Sanderson  this  would  suit  as  well  but    But  Messrs 
Sanderson  have  something  else  to  make  besides  steel  Steelmaking  is  simply  a  pretext  for 
surplusvalue making The smelting furnaces rollingmills c the buildings machinery iron 
coal  c  have  something  more  to  do  than  transform  themselves  into  steel  They  are  there  to 
absorb surplus labour and naturally absorb more in  hours than in  In fact they give by 
grace of God and law the Sandersons a cheque on the workingtime of a certain number of hands 
for all the  hours of the day and they lose their character as capital are therefore a pure loss for 
the Sandersons as soon as their function of absorbing labour is interrupted  

But then there would be the loss from so much expensive machinery lying idle 
half the time and to get through the amount of work which we are able to do on 
the present system we should have to double our premises and plant which 
would double the outlay  

But why should these Sandersons pretend to a privilege not enjoyed by the other capitalists who 
only  work  during  the  day  and  whose  buildings  machinery  raw  material  therefore  lie  idle 
during the night E F Sanderson answers in the name of all the Sandersons 

It is true that there is this loss from machinery lying idle in those manufactories 
in which work only goes on by day But the use of furnaces would involve a 
further loss in our case If they were kept up there would be a waste of fuel 
instead of as now a waste of the living substance of the workers and if they 
were not there would be loss of time in laying the fires and getting the heat up 
whilst the loss of sleeping time even to children of  is a gain of workingtime 
for the Sanderson tribe and the furnaces themselves would suffer from the 
changes of temperature Whilst those same furnaces suffer nothing from the day 
and night change of labour

Compulsory Laws for the Extension of the Working Day 

from the Middle  of the th to the End of the th 

Century 

What  is  a  working  day  What  is  the  length  of  time  during  which  capital  may  consume  the 
labourpower whose daily value it buys How far may the working day be extended beyond the 
workingtime  necessary  for  the  reproduction  of  labourpower  itself  It  has  been  seen  that  to 
these questions capital replies the working day contains the full  hours with the deduction of 
the few hours of repose without which labourpower absolutely refuses its services again Hence 
it is selfevident that the labourer is nothing else his whole life through than labourpower that 
therefore  all  his  disposable  time  is  by  nature  and  law  labourtime  to  be  devoted  to  the  self
expansion of capital Time for education for intellectual development for the fulfilling of social 

 

 

Chapter  
 
functions and for social intercourse for the freeplay of his bodily and mental activity even the 
rest  time  of  Sunday  and  that  in  a  country  of  Sabbatarians    moonshine  But  in  its  blind 
unrestrainable  passion  its  werewolf  hunger  for  surplus  labour  capital  oversteps  not  only  the 
moral but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the working day It usurps the time for 
growth  development and healthy  maintenance  of  the  body  It  steals  the time  required  for  the 
consumption of fresh air and sunlight It higgles over a mealtime incorporating it where possible 
with the process of production itself so that food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of 
production as coal is supplied to the boiler grease and oil to the machinery It reduces the sound 
sleep  needed  for  the  restoration  reparation  refreshment  of  the  bodily  powers  to  just  so  many 
hours of torpor as the revival of an organism absolutely exhausted renders essential It is not the 
normal maintenance of the labourpower which is to determine the limits of the working day it is 
the greatest possible daily expenditure of labourpower no matter how diseased compulsory and 
painful it may be which is to determine the limits of the labourers period of repose Capital cares 
nothing  for  the  length  of  life  of  labourpower  All  that  concerns  it  is  simply  and  solely  the 
maximum of labourpower that can be rendered fluent in a working day It attains this end by 
shortening the extent of the labourers life as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from 
the soil by robbing it of its fertility  
The capitalistic mode of production essentially the production of surplusvalue the absorption of 
surplus labour produces thus with the extension of the working day not only the deterioration 
of  human  labourpower  by  robbing  it  of  its  normal  moral  and  physical  conditions  of 
development and function It produces also the premature exhaustion and death of this labour
power itself It extends the labourers time of production during a given period by shortening 
his actual lifetime  
But  the  value  of  the  labourpower  includes  the  value  of  the  commodities  necessary  for  the 
reproduction  of  the  worker  or  for  the  keeping  up  of  the  workingclass  If  then  the  unnatural 
extension of the working day that capital necessarily strives after in its unmeasured passion for 
selfexpansion shortens the length of life of the individual labourer and therefore the duration of 
his labourpower the forces used up have to be replaced at a more rapid rate and the sum of the 
expenses for the reproduction of labourpower will be greater just as in a machine the part of its 
value to be reproduced every day is greater the more rapidly the machine is worn out It would 
seem therefore that the interest of capital itself points in the direction of a normal working day  
The slaveowner buys his labourer as he buys his horse If he loses his slave he loses capital that 
can only be restored by new outlay in the slavemart  

But the ricegrounds of Georgia or the swamps of the Mississippi may be fatally 
injurious to the human constitution but the waste of human life which the 
cultivation of these districts necessitates is not so great that it cannot be repaired 
from the teeming preserves of Virginia and Kentucky Considerations of 
economy moreover which under a natural system afford some security for 
humane treatment by identifying the masters interest with the slaves 
preservation when once trading in slaves is practiced become reasons for racking 
to the uttermost the toil of the slave for when his place can at once be supplied 
from foreign preserves the duration of his life becomes a matter of less moment 
than its productiveness while it lasts It is accordingly a maxim of slave 
management in slaveimporting countries that the most effective economy is that 
which takes out of the human chattel in the shortest space of time the utmost 
amount of exertion it is capable of putting forth It is in tropical culture where 
annual profits often equal the whole capital of plantations that negro life is most

recklessly sacrificed It is the agriculture of the West Indies which has been for 
centuries prolific of fabulous wealth that has engulfed millions of the African 
race It is in Cuba at this day whose revenues are reckoned by millions and 
whose planters are princes that we see in the servile class the coarsest fare the 
most exhausting and unremitting toil and even the absolute destruction of a 
portion of its numbers every year  

Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur It is of you that the story is told  Horace For slavetrade 
read labourmarket for Kentucky and Virginia Ireland and the agricultural districts of England 
Scotland  and Wales  for Africa  Germany  We  heard  how  overwork  thinned the ranks  of  the 
bakers in London Nevertheless the London labourmarket is always overstocked with German 
and other candidates for death in the bakeries Pottery as we saw is one of the shortestlived 
industries  Is  there  any  want  therefore  of  potters  Josiah  Wedgwood  the  inventor  of  modern 
pottery himself originally a common workman said in  before the House of Commons that 
the whole trade employed from  to  people In the year  the population alone 
of the town centres of this industry in Great Britain numbered  

The cotton trade has existed for ninety years It has existed for three 
generations of the English race and I believe I may safely say that during that 
period it has destroyed nine generations of factory operatives  

No doubt in certain epochs of feverish activity the labourmarket shows significant gaps In  
eg But then the manufacturers proposed to the Poor Law Commissioners that they should send 
the surpluspopulation of the agricultural districts to the north with the explanation that the 
manufacturers would absorb and use it up  

Agents were appointed with the consent of the Poor Law Commissioners  An 
office was set up in Manchester to which lists were sent of those workpeople in 
the agricultural districts wanting employment and their names were registered in 
books The manufacturers attended at these offices and selected such persons as 
they chose when they had selected such persons as their wants required they 
gave instructions to have them forwarded to Manchester and they were sent 
ticketed like bales of goods by canals or with carriers others tramping on the 
road and many of them were found on the way lost and halfstarved This system 
had grown up unto a regular trade This House will hardly believe it but I tell 
them that this traffic in human flesh was as well kept up they were in effect as 
regularly sold to these Manchester manufacturers as slaves are sold to the 
cottongrower in the United States In  the cotton trade was at its zenith 
 The manufacturers again found that they were short of hands They applied to 
the flesh agents as they are called Those agents sent to the southern downs of 
England to the pastures of Dorsetshire to the glades of Devonshire to the people 
tending kine in Wiltshire but they sought in vain The surpluspopulation was 
absorbed  

The Bury Guardian said on the completion of the French treaty that  additional hands 
could  be absorbed  by  Lancashire  and  that    or    will  be needed After  the flesh 
agents and subagents had in vain sought through the agricultural districts 

a deputation came up to London and waited on the right hon gentleman Mr 
Villiers President of the Poor Law Board with a view of obtaining poor children 
from certain union houses for the mills of Lancashire

What  experience  shows  to  the  capitalist  generally  is  a  constant  excess  of  population  ie  an 
excess in relation to the momentary requirements of surplus labourabsorbing capital although 
this excess is made up of generations of human beings stunted shortlived swiftly replacing each 
other  plucked  so  to  say  before  maturity    And  indeed  experience  shows  to  the  intelligent 
observer  with  what  swiftness  and  grip  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  dating  historically 
speaking only from yesterday has seized the vital power of the people by the very root  shows 
how the degeneration of the industrial population is only retarded by the constant absorption of 
primitive and physically uncorrupted elements from the country  shows how even the country 
labourers  in  spite of fresh  air and  the  principle  of  natural selection  that  works  so  powerfully 
amongst them and only permits the survival of the strongest are already beginning to die off   
Capital  that  has  such  good  reasons  for  denying  the  sufferings  of  the  legions  of  workers  that 
surround it is in practice moved as much and as little by the sight of the coming degradation and 
final depopulation of the human race as by the probable fall of the earth into the sun In every 
stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come but every 
one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour after he himself has caught the shower of 
gold and placed it in safety Aprs moi le dluge After me the flood is the watchword of every 
capitalist and of every capitalist nation Hence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of 
the labourer unless under compulsion from society To the outcry as to the physical and mental 
degradation the premature death the torture of overwork it answers Ought these to trouble us 
since they increase our profits But looking at things as a whole all this does not indeed depend 
on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist Free competition brings out the inherent laws of 
capitalist production in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual 
capitalist  
The establishment of a normal working day is the result of centuries of struggle between capitalist 
and  labourer  The  history  of  this  struggle  shows  two  opposed  tendencies  Compare  eg  the 
English factory legislation of our time with the English labour Statutes from the th century to 
well into the middle of the th Whilst the modern Factory Acts compulsorily shortened the 
working day the earlier statutes tried to lengthen it by compulsion Of course the pretensions of 
capital in embryo  when beginning to grow it secures the right of absorbing a quantum sufficit 
sufficient quantity of surplus labour not merely by the force of economic relations but by the 
help of the State  appear very modest when put face to face with the concessions that growling 
and  struggling  it has  to  make  in its adult condition It  takes  centuries  ere  the free labourer 
thanks  to  the  development  of  capitalistic  production  agrees  ie  is  compelled  by  social 
conditions to sell the whole of his active life his very capacity for work for the price of the 
necessaries of life his birthright for a mess of pottage Hence it is natural that the lengthening of 
the working day which capital from the middle of the th to the end of the th century tries to 
impose by Statemeasures on adult labourers approximately coincides with the shortening of the 
working day which in the second half of the th century has here and there been effected by the 
State to prevent the coining of childrens blood into capital That which today eg in the State 
of  Massachusetts  until  recently  the  freest  State  of  the  NorthAmerican  Republic  has  been 
proclaimed as the statutory limit of the labour of children under  was in England even in the 
middle  of  the  th  century  the  normal  working  day  of  ablebodied  artisans  robust  labourers 
athletic blacksmiths  
The first Statute of Labourers  Edward III  found its immediate pretext not its cause 
for  legislation  of  this  kind  lasts  centuries  after  the  pretext  for  it  has  disappeared  in  the  great 
plague that decimated the people so that as a Tory writer says The difficulty of getting men to 
work on reasonable terms ie at a price that left their employers a reasonable quantity of surplus 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour  grew to such  a  height  as  to  be  quite intolerable  Reasonable  wages were therefore 
fixed by law as well as the limits of the working day The latter point the only one that here 
interests us is repeated in the Statute of  Henry VII The working day for all artificers and 
field labourers from March to September ought according to this statute which however could 
not be enforced to last from  in the morning to between  and  in the evening But the meal
times consist of  hour for breakfast  hours for dinner and  an hour for noonmeate ie 
exactly twice as much as under the factory acts now in force In winter work was to last from  
in the morning until dark with the same intervals A statute of Elizabeth of  leaves the length 
of  the  working  day  for  all  labourers  hired  for  daily  or  weekly  wage  untouched  but  aims  at 
limiting the intervals to  hours in the summer or to  in the winter Dinner is only to last  
hour and the afternoonsleep of half an hour is only allowed between the middle of May and 
the  middle  of  August  For  every  hour  of  absence  d  is  to  be  subtracted  from  the  wage  In 
practice however the conditions were much more favourable to the labourers than in the statute
book William Petty the father of Political Economy and to some extent the founder of Statistics 
says in a work that he published in the last third of the th century 

Labouringmen then meaning fieldlabourers work  hours per diem and 
make  meals per week viz  a day for working days and  on Sundays 
whereby it is plain that if they could fast on Friday nights and dine in one hour 
and an half whereas they take two from eleven to one thereby thus working  
more and spending  less the abovementioned tax might be raised  

Was not Dr Andrew Ure right in crying down the  hours bill of  as a retrogression to the 
times of the dark ages It is true these regulations contained in the statute mentioned by Petty 
apply also to apprentices But the condition of childlabour even at the end of the th century is 
seen from the following complaint 

Tis not their practice in Germany as with us in this kingdom to bind an 
apprentice for seven years three or four is their common standard and the reason 
is because they are educated from their cradle to something of employment 
which renders them the more apt and docile and consequently the more capable 
of attaining to a ripeness and quicker proficiency in business Whereas our youth 
here in England being bred to nothing before they come to be apprentices make a 
very slow progress and require much longer time wherein to reach the perfection 
of accomplished artists  

Still  during  the  greater  part  of  the  th  century  up  to  the  epoch  of  Modern  Industry  and 
machinism  capital  in  England  had  not  succeeded  in  seizing  for  itself  by  the  payment  of  the 
weekly value of labourpower the whole week of the labourer with the exception however of 
the agricultural labourers The fact that they could live for a whole week on the wage of four 
days did not appear to the labourers a sufficient reason that they should work the other two days 
for  the  capitalist  One  party  of  English  economists  in  the  interest  of  capital  denounces  this 
obstinacy in the most violent manner another party defends the labourers Let us listen eg to 
the contest between Postlethwayt whose Dictionary of Trade then had the same reputation as the 
kindred  works  of  MacCulloch  and  MacGregor  today  and  the  author  already  quoted  of  the 
Essay on Trade and Commerce  
Postlethwayt says among other things 

We cannot put an end to those few observations without noticing that trite 
remark in the mouth of too many that if the industrious poor can obtain enough to 
maintain themselves in five days they will not work the whole six Whence they 
infer the necessity of even the necessaries of life being made dear by taxes or any 

 

 

 

Chapter  

other means to compel the working artisan and manufacturer to labour the whole 
six days in the week without ceasing I must beg leave to differ in sentiment from 
those great politicians who contend for the perpetual slavery of the working 
people of this kingdom they forget the vulgar adage all work and no play Have 
not the English boasted of the ingenuity and dexterity of her working artists and 
manufacturers which have heretofore given credit and reputation to British wares 
in general What has this been owing to To nothing more probably than the 
relaxation of the working people in their own way Were they obliged to toil the 
year round the whole six days in the week in a repetition of the same work 
might it not blunt their ingenuity and render them stupid instead of alert and 
dexterous and might not our workmen lose their reputation instead of maintaining 
it by such eternal slavery  And what sort of workmanship could we expect from 
such harddriven animals  Many of them will execute as much work in four 
days as a Frenchman will in five or six But if Englishmen are to be eternal 
drudges tis to be feared they will degenerate below the Frenchmen As our 
people are famed for bravery in war do we not say that it is owing to good 
English roast beef and pudding in their bellies as well as their constitutional spirit 
of liberty And why may not the superior ingenuity and dexterity of our artists 
and manufacturers be owing to that freedom and liberty to direct themselves in 
their own way and I hope we shall never have them deprived of such privileges 
and that good living from whence their ingenuity no less than their courage may 
proceed  

Thereupon the author of the Essay on Trade and Commerce replies 

If the making of every seventh day an holiday is supposed to be of divine 
institution as it implies the appropriating the other six days to labour he means 
capital as we shall soon see surely it will not be thought cruel to enforce it  
That mankind in general are naturally inclined to ease and indolence we fatally 
experience to be true from the conduct of our manufacturing populace who do 
not labour upon an average above four days in a week unless provisions happen 
to be very dear Put all the necessaries of the poor under one denomination for 
instance call them all wheat or suppose that  the bushel of wheat shall cost five 
shillings and that he a manufacturer earns a shilling by his labour he then would 
be obliged to work five days only in a week If the bushel of wheat should cost but 
four shillings he would be obliged to work but four days but as wages in this 
kingdom are much higher in proportion to the price of necessaries  the 
manufacturer who labours four days has a surplus of money to live idle with the 
rest of the week   I hope I have said enough to make it appear that the moderate 
labour of six days in a week is no slavery Our labouring people do this and to all 
appearance are the happiest of all our labouring poor but the Dutch do this in 
manufactures and appear to be a very happy people The French do so when 
holidays do not intervene But our populace have adopted a notion that as 
Englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of being more free and independent 
than in any country in Europe Now this idea as far as it may affect the bravery of 
our troops may be of some use but the less the manufacturing poor have of it 
certainly the better for themselves and for the State The labouring people should 
never think themselves independent of their superiors It is extremely dangerous 
to encourage mobs in a commercial state like ours where perhaps seven parts 

 

 

 

Chapter  

out of eight of the whole are people with little or no property The cure will not 
be perfect till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six days for the 
same sum which they now earn in four days  

To this end and for extirpating idleness debauchery and excess promoting a spirit of industry 
lowering the price of labour in our manufactories and easing the lands of the heavy burden of 
poors  rates  our  faithful  Eckart  of  capital  proposes  this  approved  device  to  shut  up  such 
labourers as become dependent on public support in a word paupers in an ideal workhouse 
Such ideal workhouse must be made a House of Terror and not an asylum for the poor where 
they are to be plentifully fed warmly and decently clothed and where they do but little work  
In this House of Terror this ideal workhouse the poor shall work  hours in a day allowing 
proper time for meals in such manner that there shall remain  hours of neatlabour  
Twelve workinghours daily in the Ideal Workhouse in the House of Terror of   years 
later in  when the English Parliament reduced the working day for children of  to  in 
four branches of industry to  full hours the judgment day of English Industry had dawned In 
 when Louis Bonaparte sought to secure his position with the bourgeoisie by tampering with 
the legal working day the French working people cried out with one voice the law that limits the 
working  day  to    hours  is  the  one  good  that  has  remained  to  us  of  the  legislation  of  the 
Republic   At Zrich the work of children over  is limited to  hours in Aargau in  
the work of children between  and  was reduced from  to  hours in Austria in  
for children between  and  the same reduction was made What a progress since  
Macaulay would shout with exultation  
The  House  of  Terror  for  paupers  of  which  the  capitalistic  soul  of    only  dreamed  was 
realised  a  few  years  later  in  the  shape  of  a  gigantic  Workhouse  for  the  industrial  worker 
himself It is called the Factory And the ideal this time fades before the reality  

Section  The Struggle for a Normal Working Day  
Compulsory Limitation by Law of the WorkingTime  

English Factory Acts  

After capital had taken centuries in extending the working day to its normal maximum limit and 
then  beyond  this  to  the  limit  of  the  natural  day  of    hours  there  followed  on  the  birth  of 
machinism and modern industry in the last third of the th century a violent encroachment like 
that of an avalanche in its intensity and extent All bounds of morals and nature age and sex day 
and  night  were  broken  down  Even  the ideas  of  day  and  night  of  rustic  simplicity  in the  old 
statutes  became  so  confused  that  an  English  judge  as  late  as    needed  a  quite  Talmudic 
sagacity to explain judicially what was day and what was night Capital celebrated its orgies  
As  soon  as  the  workingclass  stunned  at  first  by  the  noise  and  turmoil  of  the  new  system  of 
production recovered in some measure its senses its resistance began and first in the native 
land  of  machinism  in  England  For    years  however  the  concessions  conquered  by  the 
workpeople were purely nominal Parliament passed  labour Laws between  and  but 
was shrewd enough not to vote a penny for their carrying out for the requisite officials c  

They remained a dead letter The fact is that prior to the Act of  young 
persons and children were worked all night all day or both ad libitum  

A  normal  working  day  for  modern  industry  only  dates  from  the  Factory  Act  of    which 
included  cotton  wool  flax  and  silk  factories  Nothing  is  more  characteristic  of  the  spirit  of 
capital than the history of the English Factory Acts from  to   

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  Act  of    declares  the  ordinary  factory  working  day  to  be  from  halfpast  five  in  the 
morning to halfpast eight in the evening and within these limits a period of  hours it is lawful 
to employ young persons ie persons between  and  years of age at any time of the day 
provided no one individual young person should work more than  hours in any one day except 
in certain cases especially provided for The th section of the Act provided That there shall be 
allowed in the course of every day not less than one and a half hours for meals to every such 
person restricted as hereinbefore provided The employment of children under  with exceptions 
mentioned later was forbidden the work of children between  and  was limited to  hours a 
day nightwork ie according to this Act work between  pm and  am was forbidden 
for all persons between  and   
The lawmakers were so far from wishing to trench on the freedom of capital to exploit adult 
labourpower or as they called it the freedom of labour that they created a special system in 
order to prevent the Factory Acts from having a consequence so outrageous 

The great evil of the factory system as at present conducted says the first report 
of the Central Board of the Commission of June th  has appeared to us to 
be that it entails the necessity of continuing the labour of children to the utmost 
length of that of the adults The only remedy for this evil short of the limitation of 
the labour of adults which would in our opinion create an evil greater than that 
which is sought to be remedied appears to be the plan of working double sets of 
children  

 Under the name of System of Relays this plan was therefore carried out so that eg from 
 am until  in the afternoon one set of children between  and  and from  pm to 
 in the evening another set were put to c  
In order to reward the manufacturers for having in the most barefaced way ignored all the Acts 
as to childrens labour passed during the last twentytwo years the pill was yet further gilded for 
them Parliament decreed that after March st  no child under  after March st  no 
child under  and after March st  no child under  was to work more than eight hours in 
a factory This liberalism so full of consideration for capital was the more noteworthy as Dr 
Farre  Sir  A  Carlisle  Sir  B  Brodie  Sir  C  Bell  Mr  Guthrie  c  in  a  word  the  most 
distinguished physicians and surgeons in London had declared in their evidence before the House 
of Commons that there was danger in delay Dr Farre expressed himself still more coarsely 

Legislation is necessary for the prevention of death in any form in which it can 
be prematurely inflicted and certainly this ie the factory method must be 
viewed as a most cruel mode of inflicting it  

That  same  reformed  Parliament  which  in  its  delicate  consideration  for  the  manufacturers 
condemned children under  for years to come to  hours of work per week in the Factory 
Hell on the other hand in the Emancipation Act which also administered freedom drop by drop 
forbade the planters from the outset to work any negro slave more than  hours a week  
But in no wise conciliated capital now began a noisy agitation that went on for several years It 
turned  chiefly  on  the  age  of  those  who  under  the  name  of  children  were  limited  to    hours 
work and were subject to a certain amount of compulsory education According to capitalistic 
anthropology the age of childhood ended at  or at the outside at  The more nearly the time 
approached for the coming into full force of the Factory Act the fatal year  the more wildly 
raged the mob of manufacturers They managed in fact to intimidate the government to such an 
extent that in  it proposed to lower the limit of the age of childhood from  to  In the 
meantime  the  pressure  from  without  grew  more  threatening  Courage  failed  the  House  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
Commons It refused to throw children of  under the Juggernaut Car of capital for more than  
hours a day and the Act of  came into full operation It remained unaltered until June   
In the ten years during which it regulated factory work first in part and then entirely the official 
reports of the factory inspectors teem with complaints as to the impossibility of putting the Act 
into force As the law of  left it optional with the lords of capital during the  hours from 
  am  to    pm  to  make  every  young  person  and  every  child  begin  break  off 
resume or end his  or  hours at any moment they liked and also permitted them to assign to 
different persons different times for meals these gentlemen soon discovered a new system of 
relays by which the labourhorses were not changed at fixed stations but were constantly re
harnessed at changing stations We do not pause longer on the beauty of this system as we shall 
have to return to it later But this much is clear at the first glance that this system annulled the 
whole Factory Act not only in the spirit but in the letter How could factory inspectors with this 
complex  bookkeeping  in  respect  to  each  individual  child  or  young  person  enforce  the  legally 
determined worktime and the granting of the legal mealtimes In a great many of the factories 
the old brutalities soon blossomed out again unpunished In an interview with the Home Secretary 
  the  factory  inspectors  demonstrated  the  impossibility  of  any  control  under  the  newly 
invented  relay  system  In  the  meantime  however  circumstances  had  greatly  changed  The 
factory hands especially since  had made the Ten Hours Bill their economic as they had 
made the Charter their political electioncry Some of the manufacturers even who had managed 
their factories in conformity with the Act of  overwhelmed Parliament with memorials on 
the immoral competition of their false brethren whom greater impudence or more fortunate local 
circumstances enabled to break the law Moreover however much the individual manufacturer 
might  give  the  rein  to  his  old  lust  for  gain  the  spokesmen  and  political  leaders  of  the 
manufacturing class ordered a change of front and of speech towards the workpeople They had 
entered upon the contest for the repeal of the Corn Laws and needed the workers to help them to 
victory They promised therefore not only a doublesized loaf of bread but the enactment of the 
Ten Hours Bill in the Freetrade millennium Thus they still less dared to oppose a measure 
intended only to make the law of  a reality Threatened in their holiest interest the rent of 
land the Tories thundered with philanthropic indignation against the nefarious practices of 
their foes  
This  was  the  origin  of  the  additional  Factory  Act  of  June  th    It  came  into  effect  on 
September th  It places under protection a new category of workers viz the women over 
 They were placed in every respect on the same footing as the young persons their work time 
limited to twelve hours their nightlabour forbidden c For the first time legislation saw itself 
compelled to control directly and officially the labour of adults In the Factory Report of 
 it is said with irony 

No instances have come to my knowledge of adult women having expressed any 
regret at their rights being thus far interfered with  The workingtime of 
children under  was reduced to  and in certain circumstances to  hours a
day  

To get rid of the abuses of the spurious relay system the law established besides others the 
following important regulations  

That the hours of work of children and young persons shall be reckoned from the 
time when any child or young person shall begin to work in the morning  

So that if A eg begins work at  in the morning and B at  Bs workday must nevertheless 
end at the same hour as As The time shall be regulated by a public clock for example the 
nearest  railway  clock  by  which  the  factory  clock  is  to  be  set  The  occupier  is  to  hang  up  a 
 

Chapter  
 
legible  printed  notice  stating  the  hours  for  the  beginning  and  ending  of  work  and  the  times 
allowed  for  the  several  meals  Children  beginning  work  before    noon  may  not  be  again 
employed  after    pm  The  afternoon  shift  must  therefore  consist  of  other  children  than  those 
employed in the morning Of the hour and a half for mealtimes 

 

one hour thereof at the least shall be given before three of the clock in the 
afternoon  and at the same period of the day No child or young person shall be 
employed more than five hours before  pm without an interval for mealtime of 
at least  minutes No child or young person or female shall be employed or 
allowed to remain in any room in which any manufacturing process is then ie at 
mealtimes carried on c  

It has been seen that these minutiae which with military uniformity regulate by stroke of the 
clock the times limits pauses of the work were not at all the products of Parliamentary fancy 
They  developed  gradually  out  of  circumstances  as  natural  laws  of  the  modern  mode  of 
production Their formulation official recognition and proclamation by the State were the result 
of a long struggle of classes One of their first consequences was that in practice the working day 
of the adult males in factories became subject to the same limitations since in most processes of 
production the cooperation of the children young persons and women is indispensable On the 
whole therefore during the period from  to  the  hours working day became general 
and uniform in all branches of industry under the Factory Act  
The  manufacturers  however  did  not  allow 
this  progress  without  a  compensating 
retrogression  At  their  instigation  the  House  of  Commons  reduced  the  minimum  age  for 
exploitable  children  from    to    in  order  to  assure  that  additional  supply  of  factory  children 
which is due to capitalists according to divine and human law  
The years  are epochmaking in the economic history of England The Repeal of the Corn 
Laws and of the duties on cotton and other raw material Freetrade proclaimed as the guiding 
star of legislation in a word the arrival of the millennium On the other hand in the same years 
the Chartist movement and the  hours agitation reached their highest point They found allies 
in the Tories panting for revenge Despite the fanatical opposition of the army of perjured Free
traders with Bright and Cobden at their head the Ten Hours Bill struggled for so long went 
through Parliament  
The  new  Factory  Act  of  June  th    enacted  that  on  July  st    there  should  be  a 
preliminary shortening of the working day for young persons from  to  and all females 
to  hours but that on May st  there should be a definite limitation of the working day to 
 hours In other respects the Act only amended and completed the Acts of  and   
Capital now entered upon a preliminary campaign in order to hinder the Act from coming into 
full force on May st  And the workers themselves under the presence that they had been 
taught by experience were to help in the destruction of their own work The moment was cleverly 
chosen 

It must be remembered too that there has been more than two years of great 
suffering in consequence of the terrible crisis of  among the factory 
operatives from many mills having worked short time and many being altogether 
closed A considerable number of the operatives must therefore be in very narrow 
circumstances many it is to be feared in debt so that it might fairly have been 
presumed that at the present time they would prefer working the longer time in 
order to make up for past losses perhaps to pay off debts or get their furniture out

of pawn or replace that sold or to get a new supply of clothes for themselves and 
their families 

The  manufacturers  tried  to  aggravate  the  natural  effect  of  these  circumstances  by  a  general 
reduction of wages by  This was done so to say to celebrate the inauguration of the new 
Freetrade  era  Then  followed  a  further  reduction  of      as  soon  as  the  working  day  was 
shortened to  and a reduction of double that amount as soon as it was finally shortened to  
hours Wherever therefore circumstances allowed it a reduction of wages of at least  took 
place Under such favourably prepared conditions the agitation among the factory workers for 
the repeal of the Act of  was begun Neither lies bribery nor threats were spared in this 
attempt But all was in vain Concerning the halfdozen petitions in which workpeople were made 
to  complain  of  their  oppression  by  the  Act  the  petitioners  themselves  declared  under  oral 
examination that their signatures had been extorted from them They felt themselves oppressed 
but not exactly by the Factory Act But if the manufacturers did not succeed in making the 
workpeople speak as they wished they themselves shrieked all the louder in press and Parliament 
in the name of the workpeople They denounced the Factory Inspectors as a kind of revolutionary 
commissioners like those of the French National Convention ruthlessly sacrificing the unhappy 
factory  workers  to  their  humanitarian  crotchet  This  manoeuvre  also  failed  Factory  Inspector 
Leonard Horner conducted in his own person and through his subinspectors many examinations 
of witnesses in the factories of Lancashire About  of the workpeople examined declared in 
favour of  hours a much smaller percentage in favour of  and an altogether insignificant 
minority for the old  hours  
Another friendly dodge was to make the adult males work  to  hours and then to blazon 
abroad this fact as the best proof of what the proletariat desired in its heart of hearts But the 
ruthless Factory Inspector Leonard Horner was again to the fore The majority of the over
times declared 

They would much prefer working ten hours for less wages but that they had no 
choice that so many were out of employment so many spinners getting very low 
wages by having to work as piecers being unable to do better that if they refused 
to work the longer time others would immediately get their places so that it was a 
question with them of agreeing to work the longer time or of being thrown out of 
employment altogether  

The preliminary campaign of capital thus came to grief and the Ten Hours Act came into force 
May st  But meanwhile the fiasco of the Chartist party whose leaders were imprisoned 
and whose organisation was dismembered had shaken the confidence of the English working
class in its own strength Soon after this the June insurrection in Paris and its bloody suppression 
united in England as on the Continent all fractions of the ruling classes landlords and capitalists 
stockexchange  wolves  and  shopkeepers  Protectionists  and  Freetraders  government  and 
opposition priests and freethinkers young whores and old nuns under the common cry for the 
salvation  of  Property  Religion  the  Family  and  Society  The  workingclass  was  everywhere 
proclaimed placed under a ban under a virtual law of suspects The manufacturers had no need 
any longer to restrain themselves They broke out in open revolt not only against the Ten Hours 
Act  but  against  the  whole  of  the  legislation  that  since    had  aimed  at  restricting  in  some 
measure  the  free  exploitation  of  labourpower  It  was  a  proslavery  rebellion  in  miniature 
carried  on  for  over  two  years  with  a  cynical  recklessness  a  terrorist  energy  all  the  cheaper 
because the rebel capitalist risked nothing except the skin of his hands  
To understand that which follows we must remember that the Factory Acts of   and 
 were all three in force so far as the one did not amend the other that not one of these limited

the working day of the male worker over  and that since  the  hours from  am to 
 pm had remained the legal day within the limits of which at first the  and later the  
hours labour of young persons and women had to be performed under the prescribed conditions  
The manufacturers began by here and there discharging a part of in many cases half of the young 
persons  and  women  employed  by  them  and  then  for  the  adult  males  restoring  the  almost 
obsolete nightwork The Ten Hours Act they cried leaves no other alternative  
Their second step dealt with the legal pauses for meals Let us hear the Factory Inspectors 

Since the restriction of the hours of work to ten the factory occupiers maintain 
although they have not yet practically gone the whole length that supposing the 
hours of work to be from  am to  pm they fulfil the provisions of the statutes 
by allowing an hour before  am and half an hour after  pm for meals In 
some cases they now allow an hour or half an hour for dinner insisting at the 
same time that they are not bound to allow any part of the hour and a half in the 
course of the factory working day The manufacturers maintained therefore 
that the scrupulously strict provisions of the Act of  with regard to meal
times only gave the operatives permission to eat and drink before coming into 
and after leaving the factory  ie at home And why should not the workpeople 
eat their dinner before  in the morning The crown lawyers however decided 
that the prescribed mealtimes 
must be in the interval during the workinghours and that it will not be lawful to 
work for  hours continuously from  am to  pm without any interval  

After these pleasant demonstrations Capital preluded its revolt by a step which agreed with the 
letter of the law of  and was therefore legal  
The Act of  certainly prohibited the employment after  pm of such children from  to  
as had been employed before noon But it did not regulate in any way the  hours work of the 
children whose worktime began at  midday or later Children of  might if they began work at 
noon be employed from  to   hour from  to  in the afternoon  hours from  to  in 
the  evening    hours in all the legal    hours  Or  better  still  In  order  to make  their  work 
coincide with that of the adult male labourers up to  pm the manufacturers only had to give 
them  no  work  till    in  the  afternoon  they  could  then  keep  them  in  the  factory  without 
intermission till  in the evening 

And it is now expressly admitted that the practice exists in England from the 
desire of millowners to have their machinery at work for more than  hours a
day to keep the children at work with male adults after all the young persons and 
women have left and until  pm if the factoryowners choose  

Workmen and factory inspectors protested on hygienic and moral grounds but Capital answered 

My deeds upon my head I crave the law 
The penalty and forfeit of my bond  

In fact according to statistics laid before the House of Commons on July th  in spite of 
all  protests  on  July  th      children  were  subjected  to  this  practice  in   
factories Still this was not enough The Lynx eye of Capital discovered that the Act of  
did  not  allow    hours  work  before  midday  without  a  pause  of  at  least    minutes  for 
refreshment but prescribed nothing of the kind for work after midday Therefore it claimed and 
obtained the enjoyment not only of making children of  drudge without intermission from  to 
 pm but also of making them hunger during that time  

 

 

Ay his breast 
So says the bond  

 

Chapter  

This Shylockclinging to the letter of the law of  so far as it regulated childrens labour 
was but to lead up to an open revolt against the same law so far as it regulated the labour of 
young persons and women It will be remembered that the abolition of the false relay system 
was  the  chief  aim  and  object  of  that  law  The  masters  began  their  revolt  with  the  simple 
declaration  that the sections  of the  Act  of   which  prohibited  the  ad libitum  use  of  young 
persons and women in such short fractions of the day of  hours as the employer chose were 
comparatively  harmless so  long  as  the  worktime  was  fixed  at    hours  But  under  the Ten 
Hours  Act  they  were  a  grievous  hardship    They  informed  the  inspectors  in  the  coolest 
manner that they should place themselves above the letter of the law and reintroduce the old 
system  on  their  own  account  They  were acting  in  the interests  of the  illadvised  operatives 
themselves in order to be able to pay them higher wages  

This was the only possible plan by which to maintain under the Ten Hours Act 
the industrial supremacy of Great Britain Perhaps it may be a little difficult to 
detect irregularities under the relay system but what of that Is the great 
manufacturing interest of this country to be treated as a secondary matter in order 
to save some little trouble to Inspectors and SubInspectors of Factories  

All these shifts naturally were of no avail The Factory Inspectors appealed to the Law Courts 
But soon such a cloud of dust in the way of petitions from the masters overwhelmed the Home 
Secretary Sir George Grey that in a circular of August th  he recommends the inspectors 
not 

to lay informations against millowners for a breach of the letter of the Act or 
for employment of young persons by relays in cases in which there is no reason to 
believe that such young persons have been actually employed for a longer period 
than that sanctioned by law Hereupon Factory Inspector J Stuart allowed the 
socalled relay system during the  hours of the factory day throughout Scotland 
where it soon flourished again as of old The English Factory Inspectors on the 
other hand declared that the Home Secretary had no power dictatorially to 
suspend the law and continued their legal proceedings against the proslavery 
rebellion  

But what was the good of summoning the capitalists when the Courts in this case the country 
magistrates  Cobbetts Great Unpaid  acquitted them In these tribunals the masters sat in 
judgment  on  themselves  An  example  One  Eskrigge  cottonspinner  of  the  firm  of  Kershaw 
Leese  Co had laid before the Factory Inspector of his district the scheme of a relay system 
intended for his mill Receiving a refusal he at first kept quiet A few months later an individual 
named  Robinson  also  a  cottonspinner  and  if  not  his  Man  Friday  at  all  events  related  to 
Eskrigge appeared before the borough magistrates of Stockport on a charge of introducing the 
identical plan of relays invented by Eskrigge Four Justices sat among them three cottonspinners 
at their head this same inevitable Eskrigge Eskrigge acquitted Robinson and now was of opinion 
that what was right for Robinson was fair for Eskrigge Supported by his own legal decision he 
introduced the system at once into his own factory Of course the composition of this tribunal 
was in itself a violation of the law  

These judicial farces exclaims Inspector Howell urgently call for a remedy  
either that the law should be so altered as to be made to conform to these 
decisions or that it should be administered by a less fallible tribunal whose 

 

 

 

Chapter  

decisions would conform to the law  when these cases are brought forward I 
long for a stipendiary magistrate  

The  crown  lawyers  declared  the  masters  interpretation  of  the  Act  of    absurd  But  the 
Saviours of Society would not allow themselves to be turned from their purpose Leonard Horner 
reports 

Having endeavoured to enforce the Act  by ten prosecutions in seven 
magisterial divisions and having been supported by the magistrates in one case 
only  I considered it useless to prosecute more for this evasion of the law That 
part of the Act of  which was framed for securing uniformity in the hours of 
work  is thus no longer in force in my district Lancashire Neither have the 
subinspectors or myself any means of satisfying ourselves when we inspect a 
mill working by shifts that the young persons and women are not working more 
than  hours aday In a return of the th April  of millowners working by 
shifts the number amounts to  and has been for some time rapidly increasing 
In general the time of working the mill is extended to  hours from  am to 
 pm  in some instances it amounts to  hours from  am to  
pm  

Already in December  Leonard Horner had a list of  manufacturers and  overlookers 
who unanimously declared that no system of supervision could under this relay system prevent 
enormous  overwork  Now  the  same  children  and  young  persons  were  shifted  from  the 
spinningroom to the weavingroom now during  hours from one factory to another  How 
was it possible to control a system which 

under the guise of relays is some one of the many plans for shuffling the hands 
about in endless variety and shifting the hours of work and of rest for different 
individuals throughout the day so that you may never have one complete set of 
hands working together in the same room at the same time  

But altogether independently of actual overwork this socalled relay system was an offspring of 
capitalistic fantasy such as Fourier in his humorous sketches of Courses Seances has never 
surpassed except that the attraction of labour was changed into the attraction of capital Look 
for example at those schemes of the masters which the respectable press praised as models of 
what a reasonable degree of care and method can accomplish The personnel of the workpeople 
was sometimes divided into from  to  categories which themselves constantly changed and 
recharged their constituent parts During the  hours of the factory day capital dragged in the 
labourer now for  minutes now for an hour and then pushed him out again to drag him into 
the factory and to thrust him out afresh hounding him hither and thither in scattered shreds of 
time without ever losing hold of him until the full  hours work was done As on the stage the 
same persons had to appear in turns in the different scenes of the different acts But as an actor 
during  the  whole  course  of  the  play  belongs  to  the  stage  so  the  operatives  during    hours 
belonged to the factory without reckoning the time for going and coming Thus the hours of rest 
were turned into hours of enforced idleness which drove the youths to the pothouse and the 
girls to the brothel At every new trick that the capitalist from day to day hit upon for keeping 
his machinery going  or  hours without increasing the number of his hands the worker had to 
swallow  his  meals  now  in  this  fragment  of  time  now  in  that  At  the  time  of  the    hours 
agitation the masters cried out that the working mob petitioned in the hope of obtaining  hours 
wages for  hours work Now they reversed the medal They paid  hours wages for  or  
hours  lordship  over  labourpower  This  was  the  gist  of  the  matter  this  the  masters 
interpretation of the  hours law These were the same unctuous Freetraders perspiring with 
 

 

Chapter  
 
the love of humanity who for full  years during the AntiCorn Law agitation had preached to 
the operatives by a reckoning of pounds shillings and pence that with free importation of corn 
and with the means possessed by English industry  hours labour would be quite enough to 
enrich the capitalists This revolt of capital after two years was at last crowned with victory by 
a decision of one of the four highest Courts of Justice in England the Court of Exchequer which 
in a case brought before it on February th  decided that the manufacturers were certainly 
acting against the sense of the Act of  but that this Act itself contained certain words that 
rendered it meaningless By this decision the Ten Hours Act was abolished A crowd of 
masters who until then had been afraid of using the relay system for young persons and women 
now took it up heart and soul 
But on this apparently decisive victory of capital followed at once a revulsion The workpeople 
had hitherto offered a passive although inflexible and unremitting resistance They now protested 
in  Lancashire  and  Yorkshire in threatening  meetings  The pretended Ten  Hours  Act  was thus 
simple  humbug  parliamentary  cheating  had  never  existed  The  Factory  Inspectors  urgently 
warned the Government that the antagonism of classes had arrived at an incredible tension Some 
of the masters themselves murmured 

On account of the contradictory decisions of the magistrates a condition of 
things altogether abnormal and anarchical obtains One law holds in Yorkshire 
another in Lancashire one law in one parish of Lancashire another in its 
immediate neighbourhood The manufacturer in large towns could evade the law 
the manufacturer in country districts could not find the people necessary for the 
relay system still less for the shifting of hands from one factory to another c 
And the first birthright of capital is equal exploitation of labourpower by all capitalists  
Under these circumstances a compromise between masters and men was effected that received 
the seal of Parliament in the additional Factory Act of August th  The working day for 
young persons and women was raised from  to  hours for the first five days of the week 
and shortened to  on the Saturday The work was to go on between  am and  pm with 
pauses of not less than  hours for mealtimes these mealtimes to be allowed at one and the 
same time for all and conformably to the conditions of  By this an end was put to the relay 
system once for all For childrens labour the Act of  remained in force  
One  set  of  masters  this  time  as  before  secured  to  itself  special  seigneurial  rights  over  the 
children of the proletariat These were the silk manufacturers In  they had howled out in 
threatening fashion if the liberty of working children of any age for  hours a day were taken 
away it would stop their works It would be impossible for them to buy a sufficient number of 
children over  They extorted the privilege they desired The pretext was shown on subsequent 
investigation to be a deliberate lie It did not however prevent them during  years from 
spinning silk  hours a day out of the blood of little children who had to be placed upon stools 
for the performance of their work The Act of  certainly robbed them of the liberty of 
employing children under  longer than  hours a day But it secured to them on the other 
hand the privilege of working children between  and   hours a day and of annulling in 
their case the education made compulsory for all other factory children This time the pretext was 

the delicate texture of the fabric in which they were employed requiring a 
lightness of touch only to be acquired by their early introduction to these 
factories  

The children were slaughtered outandout for the sake of their delicate fingers as in Southern 
Russia the horned cattle for the sake of their hide and tallow At length in  the privilege 

 

Chapter  
 
granted in  was limited to the departments of silktwisting and silkwinding But here to 
make amends to capital bereft of its freedom the worktime for children from  to  was 
raised from  to  hours Pretext Labour in silk mills was lighter than in mills for other 
fabrics  and  less  likely  in  other  respects  also  to  be  prejudicial  to  health  Official  medical 
inquiries proved afterwards that on the contrary 

 

the average deathrate is exceedingly high in the silk districts and amongst the 
female part of the population is higher even than it is in the cotton districts of 
Lancashire  

Despite the protests of the Factory Inspector renewed every  months the mischief continues to 
this hour  
The Act of  changed the  hours time from  am to  pm into the  hours from  
am to  pm for young persons and women only It did not therefore affect children who 
could always be employed for half an hour before and  hours after this period provided the 
whole of their labour did not exceed  hours Whilst the bill was under discussion the Factory 
Inspectors laid before Parliament statistics of the infamous abuses due to this anomaly To no 
purpose  In  the  background  lurked  the  intention  of  screwing  up  during  prosperous  years  the 
working day of adult males to  hours by the aid of the children The experience of the three 
following years showed that such an attempt must come to grief against the resistance of the adult 
male  operatives  The  Act  of    was  therefore  finally  completed  in    by  forbidding  the 
employment  of  children  in  the  morning  before  and  in  the  evening  after  young  persons  and 
women Henceforth with a few exceptions the Factory Act of  regulated the working day of 
all  workers  in  the  branches  of  industry  that  come  under  it    Since  the  passing  of  the  first 
Factory Act half a century had elapsed  
Factory legislation for the first time went beyond its original sphere in the Printworks Act of 
  The  displeasure  with  which  capital  received  this  new  extravagance  speaks  through 
every line of the Act It limits the working day for children from  to  and for women to  
hours between  am and  pm without any legal pause for mealtimes It allows males over 
 to be worked at will day and night It is a Parliamentary abortion  
However the principle had triumphed with its victory in those great branches of industry which 
form  the  most  characteristic  creation  of  the  modern  mode  of  production  Their  wonderful 
development from  to  handinhand with the physical and moral regeneration of the 
factory  workers  struck  the  most  purblind  The  masters  from  whom  the  legal  limitation  and 
regulation had been wrung step by step after a civil war of half a century themselves referred 
ostentatiously to the contrast with the branches of exploitation still free   The Pharisees of 
Political Economy now proclaimed the discernment of the necessity of a legally fixed working 
day as a characteristic new discovery of their science It will be easily understood that after 
the factory magnates had resigned themselves and become reconciled to the inevitable the power 
of resistance of capital gradually weakened whilst at the same time the power of attack of the 
workingclass  grew  with  the  number  of  its  allies  in  the  classes  of  society  not  immediately 
interested in the question Hence the comparatively rapid advance since   
The dyeworks and bleachworks all came under the Factory Act of  in  lace and

Section  The Struggle for a Normal Working Day  Reaction 

of the English Factory Acts on Other Countries 

The  reader  will bear in  mind  that  the  production  of surplusvalue  or  the extraction  of surplus 
labour is the specific end and aim the sum and substance of capitalist production quite apart 
from any changes in the mode of production which may arise from the subordination of labour to 
capital He will remember that as far as we have at present gone only the independent labourer 
and  therefore  only  the  labourer  legally  qualified  to  act  for  himself  enters  as  a  vendor  of  a 
commodity into a contract with the capitalist If therefore in our historical sketch on the one 
hand modern industry on the other the labour of those who are physically and legally minors 
play  important  parts  the  former  was  to  us  only  a  special  department  and  the  latter  only  a 
specially striking example of labour exploitation Without however anticipating the subsequent 
development of our inquiry from the mere connexion of the historic facts before us it follows  
First The passion of capital for an unlimited and reckless extension of the working day is first 
gratified in the industries earliest revolutionised by waterpower steam and machinery in those 
first  creations  of  the  modern  mode  of  production  cotton  wool  flax  and  silk  spinning  and 
weaving The changes in the material mode of production and the corresponding changes in the 
social relations of the producers gave rise first to an extravagance beyond all bounds and then 
in opposition to this called forth a control on the part of Society which legally limits regulates 
and makes uniform the working day and its pauses This control appears therefore during the 
first half of the nineteenth century simply as exceptional legislation As soon as this primitive 
dominion of the new mode of production was conquered it was found that in the meantime not 
only had many other branches of production been made to adopt the same factory system but that 
manufactures with more or less obsolete methods such as potteries glassmaking c that old
fashioned handicrafts like baking and finally even that the socalled domestic industries such 
as nailmaking had long since fallen as completely under capitalist exploitation as the factories 
themselves Legislation was therefore compelled to gradually get rid of its exceptional character 
or where as in England it proceeds after the manner of the Roman Casuists to declare any house 
in which work was done to be a factory  
Second The history of the regulation of the working day in certain branches of production and 
the  struggle  still  going  on  in  others  in  regard  to  this  regulation  prove  conclusively  that  the 
isolated labourer the labourer as free vendor of his labourpower when capitalist production 
has once attained a certain stage succumbs without any power of resistance The creation of a 
normal working day is therefore the product of a protracted civil war more or less dissembled 
between  the  capitalist  class  and  the  workingclass  As  the  contest  takes  place  in  the  arena  of 
modern industry it first breaks out in the home of that industry  England The English factory 
workers were the champions not only of the English but of the modern workingclass generally 
as their theorists were the first to throw down the gauntlet to the theory of capital Hence the 
philosopher of the Factory Ure denounces as an ineffable disgrace to the English workingclass

that  they  inscribed  the  slavery  of  the  Factory  Acts  on  the  banner  which  they  bore  against 
capital manfully striving for perfect freedom of labour  
France limps slowly behind England The February revolution was necessary to bring into the 
world the  hours law which is much more deficient than its English original For all that 
the French revolutionary method has its special advantages It once for all commands the same 
limit to the working day in all shops and factories without distinction whilst English legislation 
reluctantly yields to the pressure of circumstances now on this point now on that and is getting 
lost  in  a  hopelessly  bewildering  tangle  of  contradictory  enactments  On  the  other  hand  the 
French law proclaims as a principle that which in England was only won in the name of children 
minors and women and has been only recently for the first time claimed as a general right  
In  the  United  States  of  North  America  every  independent  movement  of  the  workers  was 
paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the Republic Labour cannot emancipate itself in 
the white skin where in the black it is branded But out of the death of slavery a new life at once 
arose  The  first  fruit  of  the  Civil  War  was  the  eight  hours  agitation  that  ran  with  the  seven
leagued boots of the locomotive from the Atlantic to the Pacific from New England to California 
The General Congress of labour at Baltimore August th  declared 

The first and great necessity of the present to free the labour of this country from 
capitalistic slavery is the passing of a law by which eight hours shall be the 
normal working day in all States of the American Union We are resolved to put 
forth all our strength until this glorious result is attained  

At the same time the Congress of the International Working Mens Association at Geneva on the 
proposition of the London General Council resolved that the limitation of the working day is a 
preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvement and emancipation must 
prove abortive the Congress proposes eight hours as the legal limit of the working day  
Thus  the  movement  of  the  workingclass  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic  that  had  grown 
instinctively out of the conditions of production themselves endorsed the words of the English 
Factory Inspector R J Saunders 

Further steps towards a reformation of society can never be carried out with any 
hope of success unless the hours of labour be limited and the prescribed limit 
strictly enforced  

It must be acknowledged that our labourer comes out of the process of production other than he 
entered  In  the  market  he  stood  as  owner  of  the  commodity  labourpower  face  to  face  with 
other  owners  of  commodities  dealer  against  dealer  The  contract  by  which  he  sold  to  the 
capitalist  his  labourpower  proved  so  to  say  in  black  and  white  that  he  disposed  of  himself 
freely The bargain concluded it is discovered that he was no free agent that the time for which 
he is free to sell his labourpower is the time for which he is forced to sell it that in fact the 
vampire will not lose its hold on him so long as there is a muscle a nerve a drop of blood to be 
exploited For protection against the serpent of their agonies the labourers must put their 
heads together and as a class compel the passing of a law an allpowerful social barrier that 
shall prevent the very workers from selling by voluntary contract with capital themselves and 
their  families into  slavery  and  death  In  place  of the  pompous  catalogue  of  the  inalienable 
rights of man comes the modest Magna Charta of a legally limited working day which shall 
make clear when the time which the worker sells is ended and when his own begins Quantum

hours of labour as the normal working day which includes of course the normal surplus labour After 
this begins overtime which is paid a little better It will be seen later that the labour expended during

milliners dressmakers and ordinary seamstresses there are three miseries  overwork deficient air 
and  either  deficient  food  or  deficient  digestion  Needlework  in  the  main    is  infinitely  better 
adapted to women than to men But the mischiefs of the trade in the metropolis especially are that it 
is monopolised by some twentysix capitalists who under the advantages that spring from capital can 
bring  in  capital  to  force  economy  out  of  labour  This  power  tells  throughout  the  whole  class  If  a 
dressmaker can get a little circle of customers such is the competition that in her home she must 
work to the death to hold together and this same overwork she must of necessity inflict on any who 
may  assist  her  If  she  fail  or  do  not  try  independently  she  must  join  an  establishment  where  her 
labour is not less but where her money is safe Placed thus she becomes a mere slave tossed about 
with the variations of society Now at home in one room starving or near to it then engaged

light become soft and inelastic the nervous power loses its tone from defective stimulation and the 
elaboration of all growth seems to be perverted In the case of children constant access to plenty of 
light during the day and to the direct rays of the sun for a part of it is most essential to health Light 
assists in the elaboration of good plastic blood and hardens the fibre after it has been laid down It 
also acts as a stimulus upon the organs of sight and by this means brings about more activity in the

to and from work washing dressing and meals leaving a very short period indeed for rest and none 
for fresh air and play unless at the expense of the sleep necessary for young boys especially at such 
hot and fatiguing work Even the short sleep is obviously liable to be broken by a boy having to 
wake himself if it is night or by the noise if it is day Mr White gives cases where a boy worked

accompanied  with  the  old  abuses  on  these  abuses  see  Engels  lc  although  in  one  case  there 
certainly was abuse of this system in respect to a number of girls and young women brought from the 
agricultural districts of Scotland into Lancashire and Cheshire Under this system the manufacturer 
entered into a contract with the workhouse authorities for a certain period He fed clothed and lodged 
the children and gave them a small allowance of money A remark of Mr Redgrave to be quoted 
directly  seems  strange  especially  if  we  consider  that  even  among  the  years  of  prosperity  of  the 
English cotton trade the year  stands unparalleled and that besides wages were exceptionally 
high For this extraordinary demand for work had to contend with the depopulation of Ireland with 
unexampled emigration from the English and Scotch agricultural districts to Australia and America 
with  an  actual  diminution  of  the  population  in  some  of  the  English  agricultural  districts  in

 It is very characteristic of the regime of Louis Philippe the bourgeois king that the one Factory 
Act passed during his reign that of March nd  was never put in force And this law only dealt 
with childlabour It fixed  hours a day for children between  and   hours for children between 
  and    c  with  many  exceptions  which  allow  nightwork  even  for  children    years  old  The 
supervision  and  enforcement  of  this  law  are  in  a  country  where  every  mouse  is  under  police 
administration  left  to  the  goodwill  of  the  amis  du  commerce  Only  since    in  one  single 
department  the Departement du Nord  has a paid government inspector been appointed Not less 
characteristic of the development of French society generally is the fact that Louis Philippes law 
stood solitary among the allembracing mass of French laws till the Revolution of

bought  his  labourpower  is  his  the  capitalists  money  The  same  view  was  current  among  the

 It is well known with what reluctance the English Freetraders gave up the protective duty on the 
silk manufacture Instead of the protection against French importation the absence of protection to 
English factory children now serves their turn 
 During  and  the zenith years of the English cotton industry some manufacturers tried 
by the decoy bait of higher wages for overtime to reconcile the adult male operatives to an extension 
of the working day The handmule spinners and selfactor mincers put an end to the experiment by a 
petition to their employers in which they say Plainly speaking our lives are to us a burthen and 
while  we  are  confined  to  the  mills  nearly  two  days  a  week  more  than  the  other  operatives  of  the 
country we feel like helots in the land and that we are perpetuating a system injurious to ourselves 
and  future  generations  This  therefore  is  to  give  you  most  respectful  notice  that  when  we 
commence  work  again  after  the  Christmas  and  New  Years  holidays  we  shall  work    hours  per

 hours ie at  hours for ordinary days and  for Saturday Now when the fatal year

employment  of  young  persons  and  women  for    hours  during  one  year  longer  In  the  existing 
condition of the trade the time of the cotton famine it was greatly to the advantage of the operatives 
to work  hours per day and make wages when they could A bill to this effect had been brought in 
and  it  was  mainly  due  to  the  action  of  the  operative  bleachers  in  Scotland  that  the  bill  was 
abandoned Reports c for st October  pp  Thus defeated by the very workpeople 
in whose name it pretended to speak Capital discovered with the help of lawyer spectacles that the 
Act  of    drawn  up  like  all  the Acts  of Parliament  for  the  protection  of  labour  in  equivocal 
phrases  gave  them  a  pretext  to  exclude  from  its  working  the  calenderers  and  finishers  English 
jurisprudence ever the faithful servant of capital sanctioned in the Court of Common Pleas this piece 
of  pettifogging  The  operatives  have  been  greatly  disappointed    they  have  complained  of  over
work and it is greatly to be regretted that the clear intention of the legislature should have failed by 
reason of a faulty definition lc p  
 The openair bleachers had evaded the law of  by means of the lie that no women worked at 
it in the night The lie was exposed by the Factory Inspectors and at the same time Parliament was by 
petitions  from  the  operatives  bereft  of  its  notions  as  to  the  cool  meadowfragrance  in  which 
bleaching in the openair was reported to take place In this aerial bleaching dryingrooms were used 
at temperatures of from  to  Fahrenheit in which the work was done for the most part by girls 
Cooling is the technical expression for their occasional escape from the dryingrooms into the fresh 
air  Fifteen  girls  in  stoves  Heat  from    to    for  linens  and    and  upwards  for  cambrics 
Twelve girls ironing and doingup in a small room about  feet square in the centre of which is a 
close stove The girls stand round the stove which throws out a terrific heat and dries the cambrics 
rapidly for the ironers The hours of work for these hands are unlimited If busy they work till  or  
at night for successive nights Reports c for st October  p  A medical man states 
No special hours are allowed for cooling but if the temperature gets too high or the workers hands 
get soiled from perspiration they are allowed to go out for a few minutes My experience which is 
considerable in treating the diseases of stove workers compels me to express the opinion that their 
sanitary condition is by no means so high as that of the operatives in a spinning factory and Capital 
in its memorials to Parliament had painted them as floridly healthy after the manner of Rubens The 
diseases  most  observable  amongst  them  are  phthisis  bronchitis  irregularity  of  uterine  functions 
hysteria in its most aggravated forms and rheumatism All of these I believe are either directly or 
indirectly induced by the impure overheated air of the apartments in which the hands are employed 
and the want of sufficient comfortable clothing to protect them from the cold damp atmosphere in 
winter  when  going  to  their  homes  lc  pp    The  Factory  Inspectors  remarked  on  the 
supplementary law of  torn from these openair bleachers The Act has not only failed to afford 
that protection to the workers which it appears to offer but contains a clause  apparently so worded 
that  unless  persons  are  detected  working  after    oclock  at  night  they  appear  to  come  under  no 
protective provisions at all and if they do so work the mode of proof is so doubtful that a conviction 
can scarcely follow lc p  To all intents and purposes therefore as an Act for any benevolent 
or educational purpose it is a failure since it can scarcely be called benevolent to permit which is 
tantamount to compelling women and children to work  hours a day with or without meals as the 
case may be and perhaps for longer hours than these without limit as to age without reference to sex 
and  without  regard  to  the  social  habits  of  the  families  of  the  neighbourhood  in  which  such  works 
bleaching and dyeing are situated Reports c for th April  p

  In  the  Compte  Rendu  of  the  International  Statistical  Congress  at  Paris    it  is  stated  The 
French law which limits the length of daily labour in factories and workshops to  hours does not 
confine this work to definite fixed hours For childrens labour only the worktime is prescribed as 
between  am and  pm Therefore some of the masters use the right which this fatal silence gives 
them to keep their works going without intermission day in day out possibly with the exception of 
Sunday For this purpose they use two different sets of workers of whom neither is in the workshop 
more  than    hours  at  a  time  but  the  work  of  the  establishment  lasts  day  and  night  The  law  is 
satisfied  but  is  humanity  Besides  the  destructive  influence  of  nightlabour  on  the  human 
organism stress is also laid upon the fatal influence of the association of the two sexes by night in 
the same badlylighted workshops

limitation  of  the  working  day  must  succumb  before  the  broad  principle  of  the  rights  of  labour

Chapter  Rate and Mass of SurplusValue 

In this chapter as hitherto the value of labourpower and therefore the part of the working day 
necessary for the reproduction or maintenance of that labourpower are supposed to be given 
constant magnitudes  
This  premised  with  the  rate  the  mass  is  at  the  same  time  given  of  the  surplusvalue  that  the 
individual labourer furnishes to the capitalist in a definite period of time If eg the necessary 
labour amounts to  hours daily expressed in a quantum of gold   shillings then s is the daily 
value of one labourpower or the value of the capital advanced in the buying of one labourpower 
If further the rate of surplusvalue be   this variable capital of s produces a mass of 
surplusvalue of s or the labourer supplies daily a mass of surplus labour equal to  hours  
But  the  variable  capital  of  a  capitalist  is the  expression  in  money  of  the  total value  of  all  the 
labourpowers that he employs simultaneously Its value is therefore equal to the average value 
of one labourpower multiplied by the number of labourpowers employed With a given value of 
labourpower therefore the magnitude of the variable capital varies directly as the number of 
labourers employed simultaneously If the daily value of one labourpower  s then a capital of 
s must be advanced in order to exploit daily  labourpowers of n times s in order to 
exploit daily n labourpowers  
In the same way if a variable capital of s being the daily value of one labourpower produce a 
daily surplusvalue of s a variable capital of s will produce a daily surplusvalue of s 
and one of n times s a daily surplusvalue of n  s The mass of the surplusvalue produced is 
therefore equal to the surplusvalue which the working day of one labourer supplies multiplied by 
the  number  of  labourers  employed  But  as  further  the  mass  of  surplusvalue  which  a  single 
labourer  produces  the  value  of  labourpower  being  given  is  determined  by  the  rate  of  the 
surplusvalue this law follows the mass of the surplusvalue produced is equal to the amount of 
the  variable  capital  advanced  multiplied  by  the  rate  of  surplusvalue  in  other  words  it  is 
determined  by 
labourpowers  exploited 
simultaneously by the same capitalist and the degree of exploitation of each individual labour
power  
Let the mass of the surplusvalue be S the surplusvalue supplied by the individual labourer in 
the average day s the variable capital daily advanced in the purchase of one individual labour
power  v  the  sum  total  of  the  variable  capital  V  the  value  of  an  average  labourpower  P  its 
degree  of  exploitation  aa  surplus  labournecessarylabour  and  the  number  of  labourers 
employed n we would have 

the  compound  ratio  between 

the  number  of 

S  

 

 

 

sv  V 
P  aa  n 

 
It is always supposed not only that the value of an average labourpower is constant but that the 
labourers employed by a capitalist are reduced to average labourers There are exceptional cases 
in which the surplusvalue produced does not increase in proportion to the number of labourers 
exploited but then the value of the labourpower does not remain constant  
In the production of a definite mass of surplusvalue therefore the decrease of one factor may be 
compensated by the increase of the other If the variable capital diminishes and at the same time 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the rate of surplusvalue increases in the same ratio the mass of surplusvalue produced remains 
unaltered If on our earlier assumption the capitalist must advance s in order to exploit  
labourers a day and if the rate of surplusvalue amounts to  this variable capital of s 
yields a surplusvalue of s or of    working hours If the rate of surplusvalue doubles 
or the working day instead of being extended from  to  is extended from  to  hours and at 
the same time variable capital is lessened by half and reduced to s it yields also a surplus
value  of  s  or        working  hours  Diminution  of  the  variable  capital  may  therefore  be 
compensated by a proportionate rise in the degree of exploitation of labourpower or the decrease 
in the number of the labourers employed by a proportionate extension of the working day Within 
certain limits therefore the supply of labour exploitable by capital is independent of the supply of 
labourers On the contrary a fall in the rate of surplusvalue leaves unaltered the mass of the 
surplusvalue  produced  if  the  amount  of  the  variable  capital  or  number  of  the  labourers 
employed increases in the same proportion  
Nevertheless  the  compensation  of  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  labourers  employed  or  of  the 
amount of variable capital advanced by a rise in the rate of surplusvalue or by the lengthening of 
the working day has impassable limits Whatever the value of labourpower may be whether the 
working time necessary for the maintenance of the labourer is  or  hours the total value that a 
labourer can produce day in day out is always less than the value in which  hours of labour 
are embodied less than s if s is the money expression for  hours of realised labour In 
our  former  assumption  according  to  which    working  hours  are  daily  necessary  in  order  to 
reproduce the labourpower itself or to replace the value of the capital advanced in its purchase a 
variable capital of s that employs  labourers at a rate of surplusvalue of  with a 
 hours working day produces daily a surplusvalue of s or of    working hours A 
capital of s that employs  labourers a day with a rate of surplusvalue of  or with a 
working day of  hours produces only a mass of surplusvalue of s or    working 
hours and its total valueproduct the equivalent of the variable capital advanced plus the surplus
value  can  day  in  day  out  never  reach  the  sum  of  s  or        working  hours  The 
absolute limit of the average working day  this being by nature always less than  hours  sets 
an  absolute  limit  to  the  compensation  of  a  reduction  of  variable  capital  by  a  higher  rate  of 
surplusvalue  or  of  the  decrease  of  the  number  of  labourers  exploited  by  a  higher  degree  of 
exploitation  of  labourpower  This  palpable  law  is  of  importance  for  the  clearing  up  of  many 
phenomena arising from a tendency to be worked out later on of capital to reduce as much as 
possible  the  number  of  labourers  employed  by  it  or  its  variable  constituent  transformed  into 
labourpower  in  contradiction  to  its  other  tendency  to  produce  the  greatest  possible  mass  of 
surplusvalue  On  the  other  hand  if  the  mass  of  labourpower  employed  or  the  amount  of 
variable capital increases but not in proportion to the fall in the rate of surplusvalue the mass of 
the surplusvalue produced falls  
A third law results from the determination of the mass of the surplusvalue produced by the two 
factors rate of surplusvalue and amount of variable capital advanced The rate of surplusvalue 
or the degree of exploitation of labourpower and the value of labourpower or the amount of 
necessary  working  time  being  given  it  is  self  evident  that the  greater  the  variable  capital  the 
greater  would  be  the  mass  of  the  value  produced  and  of  the  surplusvalue  If  the  limit  of  the 
working  day  is  given  and  also  the  limit  of  its  necessary  constituent  the  mass  of  value  and 
surplusvalue that an individual capitalist produces is clearly exclusively dependent on the mass 
of labour that he sets in motion But this under the conditions supposed above depends on the 
mass of labourpower or the number of labourers whom he exploits and this number in its turn is 
determined by the amount of the variable capital advanced With a given rate of surplusvalue 

 

 

Chapter  
 
and a given value of labourpower therefore the masses of surplusvalue produced vary directly 
as the amounts of the variable capitals advanced Now we know that the capitalist divides his 
capital into two parts One part he lays out in means of production This is the constant part of his 
capital The other part he lays out in living labourpower This part forms his variable capital On 
the basis of the same mode of social production the division of capital into constant and variable 
differs in different branches of production and within the same branch of production too this 
relation changes with changes in the technical conditions and in the social combinations of the 
processes of production But in whatever proportion a given capital breaks up into a constant and 
a variable part whether the latter is to the former as  or  or x the law just laid down is 
not  affected  by  this  For  according  to  our  previous  analysis  the  value  of  the  constant  capital 
reappears in the value of the product but does not enter into the newly produced value the newly 
created  value  product  To  employ    spinners  more  raw  material  spindles  c  are  of 
course required than to employ  The value of these additional means of production however 
may rise fall remain unaltered be large or small it has no influence on the process of creation of 
surplusvalue  by  means  of  the  labourpowers  that  put  them  in  motion  The  law  demonstrated 
above  now  therefore  takes  this  form  the  masses  of  value  and  of  surplusvalue  produced  by 
different capitals  the value of labourpower being given and its degree of exploitation being 
equal  vary directly as the amounts of the variable constituents of these capitals ie as their 
constituents transformed into living labourpower  
This law clearly contradicts all experience based on appearance Everyone knows that a cotton 
spinner  who  reckoning  the  percentage  on  the  whole  of  his  applied  capital  employs  much 
constant and little variable capital does not on account of this pocket less profit or surplusvalue 
than  a  baker  who  relatively  sets  in  motion  much  variable  and  little  constant  capital  For  the 
solution of this apparent contradiction many intermediate terms are as yet wanted as from the 
standpoint of elementary algebra many intermediate terms are wanted to understand that  may 
represent  an  actual  magnitude  Classical  economy  although  not  formulating  the  law  holds 
instinctively to it because it is a necessary consequence of the general law of value It tries to 
rescue the law from collision with contradictory phenomena by a violent abstraction It will be 
seen  later  how  the  school  of  Ricardo  has  come  to  grief  over  this  stumbling  block  Vulgar 
economy which indeed has really learnt nothing here as everywhere sticks to appearances in 
opposition to the law which regulates and explains them In opposition to Spinoza it believes that 
ignorance is a sufficient reason  
The  labour  which  is  set  in  motion  by  the  total  capital  of  a  society  day  in  day  out  may  be 
regarded as a single collective working day If eg the number of labourers is a million and the 
average  working  day  of  a labourer is   hours the  social  working  day  consists  of  ten  million 
hours With a given length of this working day whether its limits are fixed physically or socially 
the mass of surplusvalue can only be increased by increasing the number of labourers ie of the 
labouring  population  The  growth  of  population  here  forms  the  mathematical  limit  to  the 
production of surplusvalue by the total social capital On the contrary with a given amount of 
population this limit is formed by the possible lengthening of the workingday It will however 
be seen in the following chapter that this law only holds for the form of surplusvalue dealt with 
up to the present  
From the treatment of the production of surplusvalue so far it follows that not every sum of 
money or of value is at pleasure transformable into capital To effect this transformation in fact 
a  certain  minimum  of  money  or  of  exchangevalue  must  be  presupposed  in  the  hands  of  the 
individual possessor of money or commodities The minimum of variable capital is the cost price 
of a single labourpower employed the whole year through day in day out for the production of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
surplusvalue  If  this  labourer  were  in  possession  of  his  own  means  of  production  and  were 
satisfied to live as a labourer he need not work beyond the time necessary for the reproduction of 
his  means  of  subsistence  say    hours  a  day  He  would  besides  only  require  the  means  of 
production sufficient for  working hours The capitalist on the other hand who makes him do 
besides  these    hours  say    hours  surplus  labour  requires  an  additional  sum  of  money  for 
furnishing the additional means of production On our supposition however he would have to 
employ two labourers in order to live on the surplusvalue appropriated daily as well as and no 
better  than  a  labourer  ie  to  be  able  to  satisfy  his  necessary  wants  In  this  case  the  mere 
maintenance of life would be the end of his production not the increase of wealth but this latter 
is implied in capitalist production That he may live only twice as well as an ordinary labourer 
and besides turn half of the surplusvalue produced into capital he would have to raise with the 
number of labourers the minimum of the capital advanced  times Of course he can like his 
labourer take to work himself participate directly in the process of production but he is then 
only  a  hybrid  between  capitalist  and  labourer  a  small  master  A  certain  stage  of  capitalist 
production necessitates that the capitalist be able to devote the whole of the time during which he 
functions as a capitalist ie as personified capital to the appropriation and therefore control of 
the labour of others and to the selling of the products of this labour The guilds of the middle 
ages therefore tried to prevent by force the transformation of the master of a trade into a capitalist 
by limiting the number of labourers that could be employed by one master within a very small 
maximum The possessor of money or commodities actually turns into a capitalist in such cases 
only  where  the  minimum  sum  advanced  for  production  greatly  exceeds  the  maximum  of  the 
middle ages Here as in natural science is shown the correctness of the law discovered by Hegel 
in his Logic that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into qualitative 
changes  
The minimum of the sum of value that the individual possessor of money or commodities must 
command in order to metamorphose himself into a capitalist changes with the different stages of 
development  of  capitalist  production  and  is  at  given  stages  different  in  different  spheres  of 
production  according  to  their  special  and  technical  conditions  Certain  spheres  of  production 
demand even at the very outset of capitalist production a minimum of capital that is not as yet 
found  in  the  hands  of  single  individuals  This  gives  rise  partly  to  state  subsidies  to  private 
persons as in France in the time of Clobber and as in many German states up to our own epoch 
partly to the formation of societies with legal monopoly for the exploitation of certain branches of 
industry and commerce the forerunners of our modern joint stock companies  
Within the process of production as we have seen capital acquired the command over labour 
ie over functioning labourpower or the labourer himself Personified capital the capitalist takes 
care that the labourer does his work regularly and with the proper degree of intensity  
Capital further developed into a coercive relation which compels the working class to do more 
work  than  the  narrow  round  of  its  own  lifewants  prescribes  As  a  producer  of  the  activity  of 
others as a pumperout of surplus labour and exploiter of labourpower it surpasses in energy 
disregard  of  bounds  recklessness  and  efficiency  all  earlier  systems  of  production  based  on 
directly compulsory labour  
At first capital subordinates labour on the basis of the technical conditions in which it historically 
finds it It does not therefore change immediately the mode of production The production of 
surplusvalue    in  the  form  hitherto  considered  by  us    by  means  of  simple  extension  of  the 
working day proved therefore to be independent of any change in the mode of production itself 
It was not less active in the oldfashioned bakeries than in the modern cotton factories  

 

 

Chapter  
 
If we consider the process of production from the point of view of the simple labour process the 
labourer stands in relation to the means of production not in their quality as capital but as the 
mere means and material of his own intelligent productive activity In tanning eg he deals with 
the  skins  as  his  simple  object  of  labour  It  is  not  the  capitalist  whose  skin  he  tans  But  it  is 
different as soon as we deal with the process of production from the point of view of the process 
of  creation of surplusvalue The  means  of  production  are at once  changed  into  means  for the 
absorption of the labour of others It is now no longer the labourer that employs the means of 
production but the means of production that employ the labourer Instead of being consumed by 
him as material elements of his productive activity they consume him as the ferment necessary to 
their  own  lifeprocess  and  the  lifeprocess  of  capital  consists  only  in  its  movement  as  value 
constantly expanding constantly multiplying itself Furnaces and workshops that stand idle by 
night  and  absorb  no  living  labour  are  a  mere  loss  to  the  capitalist  Hence  furnaces  and 
workshops  constitute  lawful  claims  upon  the  nightlabour  of  the  workpeople  The  simple 
transformation  of  money  into  the  material  factors  of  the  process  of  production  into  means  of 
production transforms the latter into a title and a right to the labour and surplus labour of others 
An example will show in conclusion how this sophistication peculiar to and characteristic of 
capitalist  production  this  complete  inversion  of  the  relation  between  dead  and  living  labour 
between value and the force that creates value mirrors itself in the consciousness of capitalists

oldest and most respectable houses in the West of Scotland Messrs Carlile Sons  Co of the 
linen and cotton thread factory at Paisley a company which has now existed for about a century 
which was in operation in  and four generations of the same family have conducted it

 with the title The relay system in which among other things the following grotesquely 
nave  passage  occurs  Let  us  now    see  what  evils  will  attend  the  limiting  to    hours  the

will be valued only as  so that a sixth part would thus be deducted from the value of every 
factory in the country

four generations the value of the means of production spindles c is so inseparably mixed 
up with their property as capital to expand their own value and to swallow up daily a definite 
quantity  of  the  unpaid  labour  of  others  that  the  head  of  the  firm  of  Carlile    Co  actually 
imagines that if he sells his factory not only will the value of the spindles be paid to him but in 
addition their power of annexing surplusvalue not only the labour which is embodied in them 
and is necessary to the production of spindles of this kind but also the surplus labour which they 
help to pump out daily from the brave Scots of Paisley and for that very reason he thinks that 
with  the  shortening  of  the  working  day  by    hours  the  sellingprice  of    spinning  machines 
dwindles to that of

Chapter  The Concept of Relative Surplus

Value 

That portion of the working day which merely produces an equivalent for the value paid by the 
capitalist for his labourpower has up to this point been treated by us as a constant magnitude 
and such in fact it is under given conditions of production and at a given stage in the economic 
development  of  society  Beyond  this  his  necessary  labourtime  the  labourer  we  saw  could 
continue to work for     c hours The rate of surplusvalue and the length of the working 
day  depended  on  the  magnitude  of  this  prolongation  Though  the  necessary  labourtime  was 
constant we saw on the other hand that the total working day was variable Now suppose we 
have  a  working  day  whose  length  and  whose  apportionment  between  necessary  labour  and 
surplus labour are given Let the whole line a c abc represent for example a working day of 
 hours the portion of a b  hours of necessary labour and the portion b c  hours of surplus 
labour  How  now  can  the  production  of  surplusvalue  be  increased  ie  how  can  the  surplus 
labour be prolonged without or independently of any prolongation of a c  
Although the length of a c is given b c appears to be capable of prolongation if not by extension 
beyond its end c which is also the end of the working day a c yet at all events by pushing back 
its startingpoint b in the direction of a Assume that bb in the line abbc is equal to half of b c  

abbc 

or to one hours labourtime If now in a c the working day of  hours we move the point b to 
b b c becomes b c the surplus labour increases by one half from  hours to  hours although 
the working day remains as before at  hours This extension of the surplus labourtime from b c 
to  b  c  from    hours  to    hours  is  however  evidently  impossible  without  a  simultaneous 
contraction  of  the  necessary  labourtime  from  a  b  into  a  b  from    hours  to    hours  The 
prolongation of the surplus labour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour or a 
portion of the labourtime previously consumed in reality for the labourers own benefit would 
be converted into labourtime for the benefit of the capitalist There would be an alteration not in 
the length of the working day but in its division into necessary labourtime and surplus labour
time  
On the other hand it is evident that the duration of the surplus labour is given when the length of 
the working day and the value of labourpower are given The value of labourpower ie the 
labourtime  requisite  to  produce  labourpower  determines  the  labourtime  necessary  for  the 
reproduction of that value If one workinghour be embodied in sixpence and the value of a days 
labourpower be five shillings the labourer must work  hours a day in order to replace the 
value paid by capital for his labourpower or to produce an equivalent for the value of his daily 
necessary means of subsistence Given the value of these means of subsistence the value of his 
labourpower is given and given the value of his labourpower the duration of his necessary 
labourtime is given The duration of the surplus labour however is arrived at by subtracting the 
necessary labourtime from the total working day Ten hours subtracted from twelve leave two 
and  it  is  not  easy  to  see  how  under  the  given  conditions  the  surplus  labour  can  possibly  be 
prolonged  beyond  two  hours  No  doubt  the  capitalist  can  instead  of  five  shillings  pay  the 
labourer  four  shillings  and  sixpence  or  even  less  For  the  reproduction  of  this  value  of  four 
shillings and sixpence nine hours labourtime would suffice and consequently three hours of 
surplus labour instead of two would accrue to the capitalist and the surplusvalue would rise 
from one shilling to eighteenpence This result however would be obtained only by lowering 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the  wages  of  the  labourer  below  the  value  of  his  labourpower  With  the  four  shillings  and 
sixpence which he produces in nine hours he commands onetenth less of the necessaries of life 
than  before  and  consequently  the  proper  reproduction  of  his  labourpower  is  crippled  The 
surplus labour would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its normal limits its 
domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the domain of necessary labourtime 
Despite  the  important  part  which  this  method  plays  in  actual  practice  we  are  excluded  from 
considering it in this place by our assumption that all commodities including labourpower are 
bought and sold at their full value Granted this it follows that the labourtime necessary for the 
production of labourpower or for the reproduction of its value cannot be lessened by a fall in 
the labourers wages below the value of his labourpower but only by a fall in this value itself 
Given the length of the working day the prolongation of the surplus labour must of necessity 
originate in the curtailment of the necessary labourtime the latter cannot arise from the former 
In the example we have taken it is necessary that the value of labourpower should actually fall 
by onetenth in order that the necessary labourtime may be diminished by onetenth ie from 
ten hours to nine and in order that the surplus labour may consequently be prolonged from two 
hours to three  
Such a fall in the value of labourpower implies however that the same necessaries of life which 
were formerly produced in ten hours can now be produced in nine hours But this is impossible 
without an increase in the productiveness of labour For example suppose a shoemaker with 
given tools makes in one working day of twelve hours one pair of boots If he must make two 
pairs in the same time the productiveness of his labour must be doubled and this cannot be done 
except by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working or in both Hence the conditions of 
production ie his mode of production and the labourprocess itself must be revolutionised By 
increase in the productiveness of labour we mean generally an alteration in the labourprocess 
of such a kind as to shorten the labourtime socially necessary for the production of a commodity 
and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of use
value Hitherto in treating of surplusvalue arising from a simple prolongation of the working 
day we have assumed the mode of production to be given and invariable But when surplusvalue 
has  to  be produced  by  the  conversion  of  necessary  labour into  surplus labour it  by  no  means 
suffices for capital to take over the labourprocess in the form under which it has been historically 
handed down and then simply to prolong the duration of that process The technical and social 
conditions of the process and consequently the very mode of production must be revolutionised 
before  the  productiveness  of  labour  can  be  increased  By  that  means  alone  can  the  value  of 
labourpower be made to sink and the portion of the working day necessary for the reproduction 
of that value be shortened  
The surplusvalue produced by prolongation of the working day I call absolute surplusvalue On 
the other hand the surplusvalue arising from the curtailment of the necessary labourtime and 
from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the working 
day I call relative surplusvalue  
In order to effect a fall in the value of labourpower the increase in the productiveness of labour 
must seize upon those branches of industry whose products determine the value of labourpower 
and consequently either belong to the class of customary means of subsistence or are capable of 
supplying the place of those means But the value of a commodity is determined not only by the 
quantity  of  labour  which  the  labourer  directly  bestows  upon  that  commodity  but  also  by  the 
labour contained in the means of production For instance the value of a pair of boots depends 
not only on the cobblers labour but also on the value of the leather wax thread c Hence a 
fall in the value of labourpower is also brought about by an increase in the productiveness of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the 
instruments of labour and the raw material that form the material elements of the constant capital 
required for producing the necessaries of life But an increase in the productiveness of labour in 
those  branches  of  industry  which  supply  neither  the  necessaries  of  life  nor  the  means  of 
production for such necessaries leaves the value of labourpower undisturbed  
The cheapened commodity of course causes only a pro tanto fall in the value of labourpower a 
fall  proportional  to the  extent  of  that  commoditys  employment  in  the  reproduction  of labour
power Shirts for instance are a necessary means of subsistence but are only one out of many 
The totality of the necessaries of life consists however of various commodities each the product 
of a distinct industry and the value of each of those commodities enters as a component part into 
the  value  of  labourpower  This  latter  value  decreases  with  the  decrease  of  the  labourtime 
necessary for its reproduction the total decrease being the sum of all the different curtailments of 
labourtime effected in those various and distinct industries This general result is treated here as 
if it were the immediate result directly aimed at in each individual case Whenever an individual 
capitalist cheapens shirts for instance by increasing the productiveness of labour he by no means 
necessarily aims at reducing the value of labourpower and shortening pro tanto the necessary 
labourtime But it is only in so far as he ultimately contributes to this result that he assists in 
raising the general rate of surplusvalue The general and necessary tendencies of capital must be 
distinguished from their forms of manifestation  
It  is  not  our  intention  to  consider  here  the  way  in  which  the  laws  immanent  in  capitalist 
production manifest themselves in the movements of individual masses of capital where they 
assert  themselves  as  coercive  laws  of  competition  and  are  brought  home  to  the  mind  and 
consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing motives of his operations But this much 
is clear a scientific analysis of competition is not possible before we have a conception of the 
inner nature of capital just as the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to 
any but him who is acquainted with their real motions motions which are not directly perceptible 
by the senses Nevertheless for the better comprehension of the production of relative surplus
value we may add the following remarks in which we assume nothing more than the results we 
have already obtained  
If  one  hours  labour  is  embodied  in  sixpence  a  value  of  six  shillings  will  be  produced  in  a 
working day of  hours Suppose that with the prevailing productiveness of labour  articles 
are produced in these  hours Let the value of the means of production used up in each article 
be sixpence Under these circumstances each article costs one shilling sixpence for the value of 
the means of production and sixpence for the value newly added in working with those means 
Now let some one capitalist contrive to double the productiveness of labour and to produce in the 
working day of  hours  instead of  such articles The value of the means of production 
remaining the same the value of each article will fall to ninepence made up of sixpence for the 
value of the means of production and threepence for the value newly added by the labour Despite 
the  doubled  productiveness  of  labour  the  days  labour  creates  as  before  a  new  value  of  six 
shillings and no more which however is now spread over twice as many articles Of this value 
each article now has embodied in it th instead of th threepence instead of sixpence or 
what amounts to the same thing only half an hours instead of a whole hours labourtime is now 
added  to  the  means  of  production  while  they  are  being  transformed  into  each  article  The 
individual value of these articles is now below their social value in other words they have cost 
less  labourtime  than  the  great  bulk  of  the  same  article  produced  under  the  average  social 
conditions Each article costs on an average one shilling and represents  hours of social labour 
but  under  the  altered  mode  of  production  it  costs  only  ninepence  or  contains  only    hours 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour The real value of a commodity is however not its individual value but its social value 
that is to say the real value is not measured by the labourtime that the article in each individual 
case costs the producer but by the labourtime socially required for its production If therefore 
the capitalist who applies the new method sells his commodity at its social value of one shilling 
he sells it for threepence above its individual value and thus realises an extra surplusvalue of 
threepence On the other hand the working day of  hours is as regards him now represented 
by  articles instead of  Hence in order to get rid of the product of one working day the 
demand  must  be  double  what  it  was  ie  the  market  must  become  twice  as  extensive  Other 
things being equal his commodities can command a more extended market only by a diminution 
of their prices He will therefore sell them above their individual but under their social value say 
at tenpence each By this means he still squeezes an extra surplusvalue of one penny out of each 
This augmentation of surplusvalue is pocketed by him whether his commodities belong or not to 
the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate in determining the general value of 
labourpower  Hence  independently  of  this  latter  circumstance  there  is  a  motive  for  each 
individual capitalist to cheapen his commodities by increasing the productiveness of labour  
Nevertheless  even  in  this  case  the  increased  production  of  surplusvalue  arises  from  the 
curtailment of the necessary labourtime and from the corresponding prolongation of the surplus 
labour Let the necessary labourtime amount to  hours the value of a days labourpower to 
five shillings the surplus labourtime to  hours and the daily surplusvalue to one shilling But 
the  capitalist  now  produces    articles  which  he  sells  at  tenpence  apiece  making  twenty 
shillings in all Since the value of the means of production is twelve shillings   of these 
articles merely replace the constant capital advanced The labour of the  hours working day is 
represented by the remaining   articles Since the price of the labourpower is five shillings  
articles represent the necessary labourtime and   articles the surplus labour The ratio of the 
necessary labour to the surplus labour which under average social conditions was  is now 
only  The same result may be arrived at in the following way The value of the product of the 
working day of  hours is twenty shillings Of this sum twelve shillings belong to the value of 
the means of production a value that merely reappears There remain eight shillings which are 
the expression in money of the value newly created during the working day This sum is greater 
than the sum in which average social labour of the same kind is expressed twelve hours of the 
latter labour are expressed by six shillings only The exceptionally productive labour operates as 
intensified labour it creates in equal periods of time greater values than average social labour of 
the same kind See Ch I Sect  p  But our capitalist still continues to pay as before only 
five shillings as the value of a days labourpower Hence instead of  hours the labourer need 
now  work  only    hours  in  order  to  reproduce  this  value  His  surplus  labour  is  therefore 
increased by  hours and the surplusvalue he produces grows from one into three shillings 
Hence  the  capitalist  who  applies  the  improved  method  of  production  appropriates  to  surplus 
labour a greater portion of the working day than the other capitalists in the same trade He does 
individually what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producing relative surplusvalue do 
collectively On the other hand however this extra surplusvalue vanishes so soon as the new 
method of production has become general and has consequently caused the difference between 
the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value to vanish The law of the 
determination of value by labourtime a law which brings under its sway the individual capitalist 
who applies the new method of production by compelling him to sell his goods under their social 
value this same law acting as a coercive law of competition forces his competitors to adopt the 
new  method  The  general  rate  of surplusvalue  is  therefore  ultimately  affected  by  the  whole 
process only when the increase in the productiveness of labour has seized upon those branches

of production that are connected with and has cheapened those commodities that form part of 
the necessary means of subsistence and are therefore elements of the value of labourpower  
The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness of labour And so too is the 
value of labourpower because it depends on the values of commodities Relative surplusvalue 
is on the contrary directly proportional to that productiveness It rises with rising and falls with 
falling  productiveness  The  value  of  money  being  assumed  to  be  constant  an  average  social 
working day of  hours always produces the same new value six shillings no matter how this 
sum may be apportioned between surplusvalue and wages But if in consequence of increased 
productiveness the value of the necessaries of life fall and the value of a days labourpower be 
thereby reduced from five shillings to three the surplusvalue increases from one shilling to three 
Ten hours were necessary for the reproduction of the value of the labourpower now only six are 
required  Four  hours  have  been  set free and  can  be annexed  to  the  domain  of surplus labour 
Hence  there  is  immanent  in  capital  an  inclination  and  constant  tendency  to  heighten  the 
productiveness of labour in order to cheapen commodities and by such cheapening to cheapen 
the labourer himself 
The value of a commodity is in itself of no interest to the capitalist What alone interests him is 
the  surplusvalue  that  dwells  in  it  and  is  realisable  by  sale  Realisation  of  the  surplusvalue 
necessarily  carries  with  it  the  refunding  of  the  value  that  was  advanced  Now  since  relative 
surplusvalue increases in direct proportion to the development of the productiveness of labour 
while on the other hand the value of commodities diminishes in the same proportion since one 
and the same process cheapens commodities and augments the surplusvalue contained in them 
we  have  here  the  solution  of  the  riddle  why  does  the  capitalist  whose  sole  concern  is  the 
production of exchangevalue continually strive to depress the exchangevalue of commodities 
A  riddle  with  which  Quesnay  one  of  the  founders  of  Political  Economy  tormented  his 
opponents and to which they could give him no answer 
You  acknowledge  he  says  that  the  more  expenses  and  the  cost  of  labour  can  in  the 
manufacture  of  industrial  products  be  reduced  without  injury  to  production  the  more 
advantageous is such reduction because it diminishes the price of the finished article And yet 
you  believe  that  the  production  of  wealth  which  arises  from  the  labour  of  the  workpeople 
consists in the augmentation of the exchangevalue of their products  
The  shortening  of  the  working  day  is  therefore  by  no  means  what  is  aimed  at  in  capitalist 
production when labour is economised by increasing its productiveness It is only the shortening 
of  the  labourtime  necessary  for  the  production  of  a  definite  quantity  of  commodities  that  is 
aimed at The fact that the workman when the productiveness of his labour has been increased 
produces  say    times  as  many  commodities  as  before  and  thus  spends  onetenth  as  much 
labourtime on each by no means prevents him from continuing to work  hours as before nor 
from producing in those  hours  articles instead of  Nay more his working day may 
be prolonged at the same time so as to make him produce say  articles in  hours In the 
treatises therefore of economists of the stamp of MacCulloch Ure Senior and tutti quanti the 
like  we  may  read  upon  one  page  that  the  labourer  owes  a  debt  of  gratitude  to  capital  for 
developing his productiveness because the necessary labourtime is thereby shortened and on the 
next page that he must prove his gratitude by working in future for  hours instead of  The 
object  of  all  development  of  the  productiveness  of  labour  within  the  limits  of  capitalist 
production is to shorten that part of the working day during which the workman must labour for 
his own benefit and by that very shortening to lengthen the other part of the day during which 
he  is  at  liberty  to  work  gratis  for  the  capitalist  How  far  this  result  is  also  attainable  without

Capitalist  production  only  then  really  begins  as  we  have  already  seen  when  each  individual 
capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers when consequently 
the labourprocess is carried on on an extensive scale and yields relatively large quantities of 
products A greater number of labourers working together at the same time in one place or if 
you will in the same field of labour in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the 
mastership  of  one  capitalist  constitutes  both  historically  and  logically  the  startingpoint  of 
capitalist  production  With  regard  to  the  mode  of  production  itself  manufacture  in  its  strict 
meaning  is  hardly  to  be  distinguished  in  its  earliest  stages  from  the  handicraft  trades  of  the 
guilds otherwise than by the greater number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and 
the  same  individual  capital  The  workshop  of  the  medieval  master  handicraftsman  is  simply 
enlarged 
At  first  therefore the difference is  purely  quantitative  We  have  shown that  the  surplusvalue 
produced by a given capital is equal to the surplusvalue produced by each workman multiplied 
by the number of workmen simultaneously employed The number of workmen in itself does nor 
affect either the rate of surplusvalue or the degree of exploitation of labourpower If a working 
day of  hours be embodied in six shillings  such days will be embodied in  times  
shillings In one case    workinghours and in the other  such hours are incorporated 
in  the  product  In  the  production  of  value  a  number  of  workmen  rank  merely  as  so  many 
individual  workmen  and  it  therefore  makes  no  difference  in  the  value  produced  whether  the 
 men work separately or united under the control of one capitalist  
Nevertheless within certain limits a modification takes place The labour realised in value is 
labour of an average social quality is consequently the expenditure of average labourpower Any 
average magnitude however is merely the average of a number of separate magnitudes all of one 
kind but differing as to quantity In every industry each individual labourer be he Peter or Paul 
differs from the average labourer These individual differences or errors as they are called in 
mathematics  compensate  one  another  and  vanish  whenever  a  certain  minimum  number  of 
workmen are employed together The celebrated sophist and sycophant Edmund Burke goes so 
far as to make the following assertion based on his practical observations as a farmer viz that 
in  so  small  a  platoon  as  that  of  five  farm  labourers  all  individual  differences  in  the  labour 
vanish and that consequently any given five adult farm labourers taken together will in the same 
time do as much work as any other five But however that may be it is clear that the collective 
working day of a large number of workmen simultaneously employed divided by the number of 
these workmen gives one day of average social labour For example let the working day of each 
individual  be   hours Then  the  collective  working  day  of    men  simultaneously  employed 
consists of  hours and although the labour of each of the dozen men may deviate more or less 
from average social labour each of them requiring a different time for the same operation yet 
since  the  working  day  of  each  is  onetwelfth  of  the  collective  working  day  of    hours  it 
possesses the qualities of an average social working day From the point of view however of the 
capitalist who employs these  men the working day is that of the whole dozen Each individual 
mans day is an aliquot part of the collective working day no matter whether the  men assist 
one another in their work or whether the connexion between their operations consists merely in 
the fact that the men are all working for the same capitalist But if the  men are employed in 
six pairs by as many different small masters it will be quite a matter of chance whether each of 
these masters produces the same value and consequently whether he realises the general rate of 
 

 

Chapter  
 
surplusvalue Deviations would occur in individual cases If one workman required considerably 
more  time  for  the  production  of  a  commodity  than  is  socially  necessary  the  duration  of  the 
necessary labourtime would in his case sensibly deviate from the labourtime socially necessary 
on an average and consequently his labour would not count as average labour nor his labour
power as average labourpower It would either be not saleable at all or only at something below 
the  average  value  of  labourpower  A  fixed  minimum  of  efficiency  in  all  labour  is  therefore 
assumed and we shall see later on that capitalist production provides the means of fixing this 
minimum Nevertheless this minimum deviates from the average although on the other hand the 
capitalist  has  to  pay  the  average  value  of  labourpower  Of  the  six  small  masters  one  would 
therefore squeeze out more than the average rate of surplusvalue another less The inequalities 
would be compensated for the society at large but not for the individual masters Thus the laws 
of the production of value are only fully realised for the individual producer when he produces as 
a capitalist and employs a number of workmen together whose labour by its collective nature is 
at once stamped as average social labour  
Even  without  an alteration  in the  system  of  working  the simultaneous  employment  of  a large 
number  of  labourers  effects  a  revolution  in  the  material  conditions  of  the  labourprocess  The 
buildings in which they work the storehouses for the raw material the implements and utensils 
used simultaneously or in turns by the workmen in short a portion of the means of production 
are  now  consumed  in  common  On  the  one  hand  the  exchangevalue  of  these  means  of 
production is not increased for the exchangevalue of a commodity is not raised by its usevalue 
being consumed more thoroughly and to greater advantage On the other hand they are used in 
common  and  therefore  on  a  larger  scale  than  before  A  room  where  twenty  weavers  work  at 
twenty looms must be larger than the room of a single weaver with two assistants But it costs 
less  labour  to  build  one  workshop  for  twenty  persons  than  to  build  ten  to  accommodate  two 
weavers each thus the value of the means of production that are concentrated for use in common 
on a large scale does not increase in direct proportion to the expansion and to the increased useful 
effect of those means When consumed in common they give up a smaller part of their value to 
each single product partly because the total value they part with is spread over a greater quantity 
of products and partly because their value though absolutely greater is having regard to their 
sphere  of  action in the  process  relatively  less  than the  value  of isolated  means  of  production 
Owing to this the value of a part of the constant capital falls and in proportion to the magnitude 
of the fall the total value of the commodity also falls The effect is the same as if the means of 
production  had  cost  less  The  economy  in  their  application  is  entirely  owing  to  their  being 
consumed  in  common  by  a  large  number  of  workmen  Moreover  this  character  of  being 
necessary conditions of social labour a character that distinguishes them from the dispersed and 
relatively more costly means of production of isolated independent labourers or small masters is 
acquired even when the numerous workmen assembled together do not assist one another but 
merely work side by side A portion of the instruments of labour acquires this social character 
before the labourprocess itself does so  
Economy in the use of the means of production has to be considered under two aspects First as 
cheapening  commodities  and  thereby  bringing  about  a  fall  in  the  value  of  labourpower 
Secondly as altering the ratio of the surplusvalue to the total capital advanced ie to the sum of 
the values of the constant and variable capital The latter aspect will not be considered until we 
come to the third book to which with the object of treating them in their proper connexion we 
also  relegate  many  other  points  that  relate  to  the  present  question  The  march  of  our  analysis 
compels this splitting up of the subjectmatter a splitting up that is quite in keeping with the spirit 
of capitalist production For since in this mode of production the workman finds the instruments 

 

 

Chapter  
 
of labour existing independently of him as another mans property economy in their use appears 
with  regard  to  him  to  be  a  distinct  operation  one  that  does  not  concern  him  and  which 
therefore  has  no  connexion  with  the  methods  by  which  his  own  personal  productiveness  is 
increased  
When numerous labourers work together side by side whether in one and the same process or in 
different but connected processes they are said to cooperate or to work in cooperation  
Just as the offensive power of a squadron of cavalry or the defensive power of a regiment of 
infantry  is  essentially  different  from  the  sum  of  the  offensive  or  defensive  powers  of  the 
individual cavalry or infantry soldiers taken separately so the sum total of the mechanical forces 
exerted by isolated workmen differs from the social force that is developed when many hands 
take part simultaneously in one and the same undivided operation such as raising a heavy weight 
turning a winch or removing an obstacle In such cases the effect of the combined labour could 
either not be produced at all by isolated individual labour or it could only be produced by a great 
expenditure  of  time  or  on  a  very  dwarfed  scale  Not  only  have  we  here  an  increase  in  the 
productive power of the individual by means of cooperation but the creation of a new power 
namely the collective power of masses  
Apart from the new power that arises from the fusion of many forces into one single force mere 
social contact begets in most industries an emulation and a stimulation of the animal spirits that 
heighten the efficiency of each individual workman Hence it is that a dozen persons working 
together will in their collective working day of  hours produce far more than twelve isolated 
men each working  hours or than one man who works twelve days in succession The reason 
of this is that man is if not as Aristotle contends a political at all events a social animal  
Although a number of men may be occupied together at the same time on the same or the same 
kind  of  work  yet  the  labour  of  each  as  a  part  of  the  collective  labour  may  correspond  to  a 
distinct phase of the labourprocess through all whose phases in consequence of cooperation 
the  subject  of  their  labour  passes  with  greater  speed  For  instance  if  a  dozen  masons  place 
themselves in a row so as to pass stones from the foot of a ladder to its summit each of them 
does the same thing nevertheless their separate acts form connected parts of one total operation 
they are particular phases which must be gone through by each stone and the stones are thus 
carried  up  quicker  by  the    hands  of  the  row  of  men  than  they  could  be  if  each  man  went 
separately up and down the ladder with his burden The object is carried over the same distance 
in  a  shorter time  Again a  combination of labour occurs  whenever  a  building for instance is 
taken in hand on different sides simultaneously although here also the cooperating masons are 
doing the same or the same kind of work The  masons in their collective working day of  
hours make much more progress with the building than one mason could make working for  
days or  hours The reason is that a body of men working in concert has hands and eyes both 
before  and  behind  and  is  to  a  certain  degree  omnipresent  The  various  parts  of  the  work 
progress simultaneously  
In the above instances we have laid stress upon the point that the men do the same or the same 
kind of work because this the most simple form of labour in common plays a great part in co
operation  even  in  its  most  fully  developed  stage  If  the  work  be  complicated  then  the  mere 
number of the men who cooperate allows of the various operations being apportioned to different 
hands  and  consequently  of  being  carried  on  simultaneously  The  time  necessary  for  the 
completion of the whole work is thereby shortened  
In  many  industries  there  are  critical  periods  determined  by  the  nature  of  the  process  during 
which certain definite results must be obtained For instance if a flock of sheep has to be shorn 
or a field of wheat to be cut and harvested the quantity and quality of the product depends on the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
work being begun and ended within a certain time In these cases the time that ought to be taken 
by  the  process  is  prescribed  just  as  it  is  in  herring  fishing  A  single  person  cannot  carve  a 
working day of more than say  hours out of the natural day but  men cooperating extend 
the working day to  hours The shortness of the time allowed for the work is compensated 
for by the large mass of labour thrown upon the field of production at the decisive moment The 
completion  of  the  task  within  the  proper  time  depends  on  the  simultaneous  application  of 
numerous  combined  working  days  the  amount  of  useful  effect  depends  on  the  number  of 
labourers this number however is always smaller than the number of isolated labourers required 
to do the same amount of work in the same period It is owing to the absence of this kind of co
operation that in the western part of the United States quantities of corn and in those parts of 
East India where English rule has destroyed the old communities quantities of cotton are yearly 
wasted  
On the one hand cooperation allows of the work being carried on over an extended space it  is 
consequently  imperatively  called  for  in  certain  undertakings  such  as  draining  constructing 
dykes irrigation works and the making of canals roads and railways On the other hand while 
extending  the  scale  of  production  it  renders  possible  a  relative  contraction  of  the  arena  This 
contraction of arena simultaneous with and arising from extension of scale whereby a number 
of useless expenses are cut down is owing to the conglomeration of labourers to the aggregation 
of various processes and to the concentration of the means of production  
The  combined  working  day  produces  relatively  to  an  equal  sum  of  isolated  working  days  a 
greater quantity of usevalues and consequently diminishes the labourtime necessary for the 
production of a given useful effect Whether the combined working day in a given case acquires 
this increased productive power because it heightens the mechanical force of labour or extends 
its sphere of action over a greater space or contracts the field of production relatively to the scale 
of production or at the critical moment sets large masses of labour to work or excites emulation 
between individuals and raises their animal spirits or impresses on the similar operations carried 
on by a number of men the stamp of continuity and manysidedness or performs simultaneously 
different  operations  or  economises  the  means  of  production  by  use  in  common  or  lends  to 
individual labour the character of average social labour whichever of these be the cause of the 
increase the special productive power of the combined working day is under all circumstances 
the social productive power of labour or the productive power of social labour This power is due 
to cooperation itself When the labourer cooperates systematically with others he strips off the 
fetters of his individuality and develops the capabilities of his species  
As a general rule labourers cannot cooperate without being brought together their assemblage 
in  one  place  is  a  necessary  condition  of  their  cooperation  Hence  wagelabourers  cannot  co
operate unless they are employed simultaneously by the same capital the same capitalist and 
unless therefore their labourpowers are bought simultaneously by him The total value of these 
labourpowers or the amount of the wages of these labourers for a day or a week as the case 
may be must be ready in the pocket of the capitalist before the workmen are assembled for the 
process of production The payment of  workmen at once though only for one day requires a 
greater  outlay  of  capital  than  does  the  payment  of  a  smaller  number  of  men  week  by  week 
during  a  whole  year  Hence  the  number  of  the  labourers  that  cooperate  or  the  scale  of  co
operation depends in the first instance on the amount of capital that the individual capitalist can 
spare for the purchase of labourpower in other words on the extent to which a single capitalist 
has command over the means of subsistence of a number of labourers  
And  as  with  the  variable  so  it  is  with  the  constant  capital  For  example  the  outlay  on  raw 
material is  times as great for the capitalist who employs  men as it is for each of the  

 

 

Chapter  
 
capitalists  who  employ    men  The  value  and  quantity  of  the  instruments  of  labour  used  in 
common  do  not  it  is  true  increase  at  the  same  rate  as  the  number  of  workmen  but  they  do 
increase very considerably Hence concentration of large masses of the means of production in 
the hands of individual capitalists is a material condition for the cooperation of wagelabourers 
and  the  extent  of  the  cooperation  or  the  scale  of  production  depends  on  the  extent  of  this 
concentration  
We saw in a former chapter that a certain minimum amount of capital was necessary in order 
that the number of labourers simultaneously employed and consequently the amount of surplus
value produced might suffice to liberate the employer himself from manual labour to convert 
him from a small master into a capitalist and thus formally to establish capitalist production We 
now see that a certain minimum amount is a necessary condition for the conversion of numerous 
isolated and independent processes into one combined social process  
We also saw that at first the subjection of labour to capital was only a formal result of the fact 
that the labourer instead of working for himself works for and consequently under the capitalist 
By the cooperation of numerous wagelabourers the sway of capital develops into a requisite for 
carrying on the labourprocess itself into a real requisite of production That a capitalist should 
command on the field of production is now as indispensable as that a general should command 
on the field of battle  
All  combined  labour  on  a  large  scale  requires  more  or  less  a  directing  authority  in  order  to 
secure the harmonious working of the individual activities and to perform the general functions 
that have their origin in the action of the combined organism as distinguished from the action of 
its separate organs A single violin player is his own conductor an orchestra requires a separate 
one  The  work  of  directing  superintending  and  adjusting  becomes  one  of  the  functions  of 
capital from the moment that the labour under the control of capital becomes cooperative Once 
a function of capital it acquires special characteristics  
The directing motive the end and aim of capitalist production is to extract the greatest possible 
amount  of  surplusvalue  and  consequently  to  exploit  labourpower  to  the  greatest  possible 
extent As the number of the cooperating labourers increases so too does their resistance to the 
domination  of  capital  and  with  it  the  necessity  for  capital  to  overcome  this  resistance  by 
counterpressure The control exercised by the capitalist is not only a special function due to the 
nature  of  the  social  labourprocess  and  peculiar  to  that  process  but  it  is  at  the  same  time  a 
function  of  the  exploitation  of  a  social  labourprocess  and  is  consequently  rooted  in  the 
unavoidable  antagonism  between  the  exploiter  and  the  living  and  labouring  raw  material  he 
exploits  
Again  in  proportion  to  the  increasing  mass  of  the  means  of  production  now  no  longer  the 
property of the labourer but of the capitalist the necessity increases for some effective control 
over the proper application of those means Moreover the cooperation of wage labourers is 
entirely brought about by the capital that employs them Their union into one single productive 
body and the establishment of a connexion between their individual functions are matters foreign 
and external to them are not their own act but the act of the capital that brings and keeps them 
together Hence the connexion existing between their various labours appears to them ideally in 
the shape of a preconceived plan of the capitalist and practically in the shape of the authority of 
the same capitalist in the shape of the powerful will of another who subjects their activity to his 
aims  If  then  the  control  of  the  capitalist  is  in  substance  twofold  by  reason  of  the  twofold 
nature  of  the  process  of  production  itself  which  on  the  one  hand  is  a  social  process  for 
producing usevalues on the other a process for creating surplusvalue in form that control is 
despotic As cooperation extends its scale this despotism takes forms peculiar to itself Just as at

first the capitalist is relieved from actual labour so soon as his capital has reached that minimum 
amount  with  which  capitalist  production  as  such  begins  so  now  he  hands  over  the  work  of 
direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen and groups of workmen to a special 
kind  of  wagelabourer  An  industrial  army  of  workmen  under  the  command  of  a  capitalist 
requires like a real army officers managers and sergeants foremen overlookers who while 
the work is being done command in the name of the capitalist The work of supervision becomes 
their  established  and  exclusive  function  When  comparing  the  mode  of  production  of  isolated 
peasants and artisans with production by slavelabour the political economist counts this labour 
of  superintendence  among  the  faux  frais  of  production  But  when  considering  the  capitalist 
mode of production he on the contrary treats the work of control made necessary by the co
operative  character  of  the  labourprocess  as  identical  with  the  different  work  of  control 
necessitated by the capitalist character of that process and the antagonism of interests between 
capitalist and labourer It is not because he is a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist on 
the contrary he is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist The leadership of industry is an 
attribute of capital just as in feudal times the functions of general and judge were attributes of 
landed property  
The labourer is the owner of his labourpower until he has done bargaining for its sale with the 
capitalist and he can sell no more than what he has ie his individual isolated labourpower 
This  state  of  things  is  in  no  way  altered  by  the  fact  that  the  capitalist  instead  of  buying  the 
labourpower  of  one  man  buys  that  of    and  enters  into  separate  contracts  with   
unconnected men instead of with one He is at liberty to set the  men to work without letting 
them cooperate He pays them the value of  independent labourpowers but he does not pay 
for the combined labourpower of the hundred Being independent of each other the labourers are 
isolated persons who enter into relations with the capitalist but not with one another This co
operation begins only with the labourprocess but they have then ceased to belong to themselves 
On entering that process they become incorporated with capital As cooperators as members of 
a working organism they are but special modes of existence of capital Hence the productive 
power  developed  by  the  labourer  when  working  in  cooperation  is  the  productive  power  of 
capital  This  power  is  developed  gratuitously  whenever  the  workmen  are  placed  under  given 
conditions  and  it  is  capital  that  places  them  under  such  conditions  Because  this  power  costs 
capital nothing and because on the other hand the labourer himself does not develop it before 
his labour belongs to capital it appears as a power with which capital is endowed by Nature  a 
productive power that is immanent in capital 
The colossal effects of simple cooperation are to be seen in the gigantic structures of the ancient 
Asiatics Egyptians Etruscans c 

It has happened in times past that these Oriental States after supplying the 
expenses of their civil and military establishments have found themselves in 
possession of a surplus which they could apply to works of magnificence or utility 
and in the construction of these their command over the hands and arms of almost 
the entire nonagricultural population has produced stupendous monuments which 
still indicate their power The teeming valley of the Nile  produced food for a 
swarming nonagricultural population and this food belonging to the monarch 
and the priesthood afforded the means of erecting the mighty monuments which 
filled the land In moving the colossal statues and vast masses of which the 
transport creates wonder human labour almost alone was prodigally used The 
number of the labourers and the concentration of their efforts sufficed We see 
mighty coral reefs rising from the depths of the ocean into islands and firm land

yet each individual depositor is puny weak and contemptible The non
agricultural labourers of an Asiatic monarchy have little but their individual 
bodily exertions to bring to the task but their number is their strength and the 
power of directing these masses gave rise to the palaces and temples the 
pyramids and the armies of gigantic statues of which the remains astonish and 
perplex us It is that confinement of the revenues which feed them to one or a few 
hands which makes such undertakings possible  

This power of Asiatic and Egyptian kings Etruscan theocrats c has in modern society been 
transferred to the capitalist whether he be an isolated or as in jointstock companies a collective 
capitalist  
Cooperation such as we find it at the dawn of human development among races who live by the 
chase or say in the agriculture of Indian communities is based on the one hand on ownership 
in common of the means of production and on the other hand on the fact that in those cases 
each individual has no more torn himself off from the navelstring of his tribe or community than 
each bee has freed itself from connexion with the hive Such cooperation is distinguished from 
capitalistic  cooperation  by  both  of  the  above  characteristics  The  sporadic  application  of  co
operation on a large scale in ancient times in the middle ages and in modern colonies reposes on 
relations of dominion and servitude principally on slavery The capitalistic form on the contrary 
presupposes  from  first  to  last  the  free  wagelabourer  who  sells  his  labourpower  to  capital 
Historically  however  this  form  is  developed  in  opposition  to  peasant  agriculture  and  to  the 
carrying on of independent handicrafts whether in guilds or not From the standpoint of these 
capitalistic cooperation does not manifest itself as a particular historical form of cooperation 
but cooperation itself appears to be a historical form peculiar to and specifically distinguishing 
the capitalist process of production  
Just as the social productive power of labour that is developed by cooperation appears to be the 
productive  power  of  capital  so  cooperation  itself  contrasted  with  the  process  of  production 
carried on by isolated independent labourers or even by small employers appears to be a specific 
form  of  the  capitalist  process  of  production  It  is  the  first  change  experienced  by  the  actual 
labourprocess  when  subjected  to  capital  This  change  takes  place  spontaneously  The 
simultaneous  employment  of  a  large  number  of  wagelabourers  in  one  and  the  same  process 
which  is  a  necessary  condition  of  this  change  also  forms  the  startingpoint  of  capitalist 
production  This  point  coincides  with  the  birth  of  capital  itself  If  then  on  the  one  hand  the 
capitalist  mode  of  production  presents  itself  to  us  historically  as  a  necessary  condition  to  the 
transformation of the labourprocess into a social process so on the other hand this social form 
of  the  labourprocess  presents  itself  as  a  method  employed  by  capital  for  the  more  profitable 
exploitation of labour by increasing that labours productiveness  
In  the  elementary  form  under  which  we  have  hitherto  viewed  it  cooperation  is  a  necessary 
concomitant of all production on a large scale but it does not in itself represent a fixed form 
characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production At the 
most  it  appears  to  do  so  and  that  only  approximately  in  the  handicraftlike  beginnings  of 
manufacture and in that kind of agriculture on a large scale which corresponds to the epoch of 
manufacture  and  is  distinguished  from  peasant  agriculture  mainly  by  the  number  of  the 
labourers simultaneously employed and by the mass of the means of production concentrated for 
their use Simple cooperation is always the prevailing form in those branches of production in 
which  capital  operates  on  a  large  scale  and  division  of  labour  and  machinery  play  but  a 
subordinate part

Chapter  Division of Labour and Manufacture 

Section  TwoFold Origin of Manufacture 

That cooperation which is based on division of labour assumes its typical form in manufacture 
and  is  the  prevalent  characteristic  form  of  the  capitalist  process  of  production  throughout  the 
manufacturing period properly so called That period roughly speaking extends from the middle 
of the th to the last third of the th century  
Manufacture takes its rise in two ways  
  By  the  assemblage  in  one  workshop  under  the  control  of  a  single  capitalist  of  labourers 
belonging to various independent handicrafts but through whose hands a given article must pass 
on its way to completion A carriage for example was formerly the product of the labour of a 
great number of independent artificers such as wheelwrights harnessmakers tailors locksmiths 
upholsterers turners fringemakers glaziers painters polishers gilders c In the manufacture 
of carriages however all these different artificers are assembled in one building where they work 
into one anothers hands It is true that a carriage cannot be gilt before it has been made But if a 
number  of  carriages  are  being  made  simultaneously  some  may  be  in  the  hands  of  the  gilders 
while others are going through an earlier process So far we are still in the domain of simple co
operation which finds its materials ready to hand in the shape of men and things But very soon 
an important change takes place The tailor the locksmith and the other artificers being now 
exclusively  occupied  in  carriagemaking  each  gradually  loses  through  want  of  practice  the 
ability to carry on to its full extent his old handicraft But on the other hand his activity now 
confined in one groove assumes the form best adapted to the narrowed sphere of action At first 
carriage manufacture is a combination of various independent handicrafts By degrees it becomes 
the splitting up of carriagemaking into its various detail processes each of which crystallises into 
the exclusive function of a particular workman the manufacture as a whole being carried on by 
the  men  in  conjunction  In  the  same  way  cloth  manufacture  as  also  a  whole  series  of  other 
manufactures  arose  by  combining  different  handicrafts  together  under  the  control  of  a  single 
capitalist  
  Manufacture  also  arises  in  a  way  exactly  the  reverse  of  this    namely  by  one  capitalist 
employing simultaneously in one workshop a number of artificers who all do the same or the 
same  kind  of  work  such  as  making  paper  type  or  needles  This  is  cooperation  in  its  most 
elementary  form  Each  of  these  artificers  with  the  help  perhaps  of  one  or  two  apprentices 
makes  the  entire  commodity  and  he  consequently  performs  in  succession  all  the  operations 
necessary for its production He still works in his old handicraftlike way But very soon external 
circumstances cause a different use to be made of the concentration of the workmen on one spot 
and of the simultaneousness of their work An increased quantity of the article has perhaps to be 
delivered within a given time The work is therefore redistributed Instead of each man being 
allowed  to  perform  all  the  various  operations  in  succession  these  operations  are  changed  into 
disconnected isolated ones carried on side by side each is assigned to a different artificer and 
the  whole  of  them  together  are  performed  simultaneously  by  the  cooperating  workmen  This 
accidental repartition gets repeated develops advantages of its own and gradually ossifies into a 
systematic  division  of  labour  The  commodity  from  being  the  individual  product  of  an 
independent artificer becomes the social product of a union of artificers each of whom performs 
one and only one of the constituent partial operations The same operations which in the case of 
a papermaker belonging to a German Guild merged one into the other as the successive acts of 
one artificer became in the Dutch paper manufacture so many partial operations carried on side 
 

 

Chapter  
 
by side by numerous cooperating labourers The needlemaker of the Nuremberg Guild was the 
cornerstone on which the English needle manufacture was raised But while in Nuremberg that 
single artificer performed a series of perhaps  operations one after another in England it was 
not long before there were  needlemakers side by side each performing one alone of those  
operations and in consequence of further experience each of those  operations was again split 
up isolated and made the exclusive function of a separate workman  
The mode in which manufacture arises its growth out of handicrafts is therefore twofold On the 
one hand it arises from the union of various independent handicrafts which become stripped of 
their  independence  and  specialised  to  such  an  extent  as  to  be  reduced  to  mere  supplementary 
partial processes in the production of one particular commodity On the other hand it arises from 
the  cooperation  of  artificers  of  one  handicraft  it  splits  up  that  particular  handicraft  into  its 
various detail operations isolating and making these operations independent of one another up to 
the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer On the one hand 
therefore manufacture either introduces division of labour into a process of production or further 
develops  that  division  on  the  other  hand  it  unites  together  handicrafts  that  were  formerly 
separate But whatever may have been its particular startingpoint its final form is invariably the 
same  a productive mechanism whose parts are human beings  
For  a  proper  understanding  of  the  division  of  labour  in  manufacture  it  is  essential  that  the 
following points be firmly grasped First the decomposition of a process of production into its 
various  successive  steps  coincides  here  strictly  with  the  resolution  of  a  handicraft  into  its 
successive  manual  operations  Whether  complex  or  simple  each  operation  has  to  be  done  by 
hand  retains  the  character  of  a  handicraft  and  is  therefore  dependent  on  the  strength  skill 
quickness  and  sureness  of  the  individual  workman  in  handling  his  tools  The  handicraft 
continues to be the basis This narrow technical basis excludes a really scientific analysis of any 
definite process of industrial production since it is still a condition that each detail process gone 
through  by  the  product  must  be  capable  of  being  done  by  hand  and  of  forming  in  its  way  a 
separate handicraft It is just because handicraft skill continues in this way to be the foundation 
of  the  process  of  production  that  each  workman  becomes  exclusively  assigned  to  a  partial 
function and that for the rest of his life his labourpower is turned into the organ of this detail 
function  
Secondly  this  division  of  labour  is  a  particular  sort  of  cooperation  and  many  of  its 
disadvantages spring from the general character of cooperation and not from this particular form 
of it  

Section  The Detail Labourer and his Implements 

If  we  now  go  more  into  detail  it  is  in  the  first  place  clear  that  a  labourer  who  all  his  life 
performs  one  and  the  same  simple  operation  converts  his  whole  body  into  the  automatic 
specialised implement of that operation Consequently he takes less time in doing it than the 
artificer  who  performs  a  whole  series  of  operations  in  succession  But  the  collective  labourer 
who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture is made up solely of such specialised detail 
labourers Hence in comparison with the independent handicraft more is produced in a given 
time or the productive power of labour is increased Moreover when once this fractional work 
is established as the exclusive function of one person the methods it employs become perfected 
The workmans continued repetition of the same simple act and the concentration of his attention 
on it teach him by experience how to attain the desired effect with the minimum of exertion But 
since there are always several generations of labourers living at one time and working together at

the manufacture of a given article the technical skill the tricks of the trade thus acquired become 
established and are accumulated and handed down  
Manufacture in fact produces the skill of the detail labourer by reproducing and systematically 
driving  to  an  extreme  within  the  workshop  the  naturally  developed  differentiation  of  trades 
which it found ready to hand in society at large On the other hand the conversion of fractional 
work into the lifecalling of one man corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies to 
make  trades  hereditary  either  to  petrify  them  into  castes  or  whenever  definite  historical 
conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of 
castes to ossify them into guilds Castes and guilds arise from the action of the same natural law 
that  regulates  the  differentiation  of  plants  and  animals  into  species  and  varieties  except  that 
when  a  certain  degree  of  development  has  been  reached  the  heredity  of  castes  and  the 
exclusiveness of guilds are ordained as a law of society

to son that gives to the Hindu as it does to the spider this proficiency And yet the work of such 
a Hindu weaver is very complicated compared with that of a manufacturing labourer  
An artificer who performs one after another the various fractional operations in the production of 
a finished article must at one time change his place at another his tools The transition from one 
operation to another interrupts the flow of his labour and creates so to say gaps in his working 
day These gaps close up so soon as he is tied to one and the same operation all day long they 
vanish  in  proportion  as  the  changes  in  his  work  diminish  The  resulting  increased  productive 
power  is  owing  either  to  an  increased  expenditure  of  labourpower  in  a  given  time  ie  to 
increased  intensity  of  labour  or  to  a  decrease  in  the  amount  of  labourpower  unproductively 
consumed The extra expenditure of power demanded by every transition from rest to motion is 
made up for by prolonging the duration of the normal velocity when once acquired On the other 
hand  constant  labour  of  one  uniform  kind  disturbs  the  intensity  and  flow  of  a  mans  animal 
spirits which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity  
The productiveness of labour depends not only on the proficiency of the workman but on the 
perfection of his tools Tools of the same kind such as knives drills gimlets hammers c may 
be  employed  in  different processes and the  same  tool  may  serve  various  purposes in a  single 
process But so soon as the different operations of a labourprocess are disconnected the one from 
the other and each fractional operation acquires in the hands of the detail labourer a suitable and 
peculiar form alterations become necessary in the implements that previously served more than 
one purpose The direction taken by this change is determined by the difficulties experienced in 
consequence  of  the  unchanged  form  of  the  implement  Manufacture  is  characterised  by  the 
differentiation of the instruments of labour  a differentiation whereby implements of a given sort 
acquire  fixed shapes adapted to each  particular  application  and  by  the  specialisation  of  those 
 

 

Chapter  
 
instruments giving to each special implement its full play only in the hands of a specific detail 
labourer  In  Birmingham  alone    varieties  of  hammers  are  produced  and  not  only  is  each 
adapted to one particular process but several varieties often serve exclusively for the different 
operations  in  one  and  the  same  process  The  manufacturing  period  simplifies  improves  and 
multiplies the implements of labour by adapting them to the exclusively special functions of each 
detail labourer It thus creates at the same time one of the material conditions for the existence of 
machinery which consists of a combination of simple instruments  
The detail labourer and his implements are the simplest elements of manufacture Let us now turn 
to its aspect as a whole  

Section  The Two Fundamental Forms of Manufacture 
Heterogeneous Manufacture Serial Manufacture 

The  organisation  of  manufacture  has  two  fundamental  forms  which  in  spite  of  occasional 
blending  are  essentially  different  in  kind  and  moreover  play  very  distinct  parts  in  the 
subsequent transformation of manufacture into modern industry carried on by machinery This 
double character arises from the nature of the article produced This article either results from the 
mere mechanical fitting together of partial products made independently or owes its completed 
shape to a series of connected processes and manipulations  
A locomotive for instance consists of more than  independent parts It cannot however 
serve as an example of the first kind of genuine manufacture for it is a structure produced by 
modern mechanical industry But a watch can and William Petty used it to illustrate the division 
of labour in manufacture Formerly the individual work of a Nuremberg artificer the watch has 
been  transformed  into  the  social  product  of  an  immense  number  of  detail  labourers  such  as 
mainspring makers dial makers spiral spring makers jewelled hole makers ruby lever makers 
hand  makers  case  makers  screw  makers  gilders  with  numerous  subdivisions  such  as  wheel 
makers brass and steel separate pin makers movement makers acheveur de pignon fixes the 
wheels on the axles polishes the facets c pivot makers planteur de finissage puts the wheels 
and springs in the works finisseur de barillet cuts teeth in the wheels makes the holes of the 
right size c escapement makers cylinder makers for cylinder escapements escapement wheel 
makers balance wheel makers raquette makers apparatus for regulating the watch the planteur 
dchappement escapement maker proper then the repasseur de barillet finishes the box for the 
spring  c  steel  polishers  wheel  polishers  screw  polishers  figure  painters  dial  enamellers 
melt  the  enamel  on  the  copper  fabricant  de  pendants  makes  the  ring  by  which  the  case  is 
hung finisseur de charnire puts the brass hinge in the cover c faiseur de secret puts in the 
springs  that  open  the  case  graveur  ciseleur  polisseur  de  bote  c  c  and  last  of  all  the 
repasseur who fits together the whole watch and hands it over in a going state Only a few parts 
of the watch pass through several hands and all these membra disjecta come together for the first 
time in the hand that binds them into one mechanical whole This external relation between the 
finished product and its various and diverse elements makes it as well in this case as in the case 
of  all  similar  finished  articles  a  matter  of  chance  whether  the  detail  labourers  are  brought 
together in one workshop or not The detail operations may further be carried on like so many 
independent  handicrafts  as  they  are  in  the  Cantons of Vaud and  Neufchtel while in  Geneva 
there  exist  large  watch  manufactories  where  the  detail  labourers  directly  cooperate  under  the 
control of a single capitalist And even in the latter case the dial the springs and the case are 
seldom made in the factory itself To carry on the trade as a manufacture with concentration of 
workmen  is  in  the  watch  trade  profitable  only  under  exceptional  conditions  because 

 

 

Chapter  
 
competition  is  greater  between  the  labourers  who  desire  to  work  at  home  and  because  the 
splitting up of the work into a number of heterogeneous processes permits but little use of the 
instruments of labour in common and the capitalist by scattering the work saves the outlay on 
workshops c Nevertheless the position of this detail labourer who though he works at home 
does so for a capitalist manufacturer tablisseur is very different from that of the independent 
artificer who works for his own customers 
The second kind of manufacture its perfected form produces articles that go through connected 
phases  of  development  through  a  series  of  processes  step  by  step  like  the  wire  in  the 
manufacture of needles which passes through the hands of  and sometimes even  different 
detail workmen  
In so far as such a manufacture when first started combines scattered handicrafts it lessens the 
space by which the various phases of production are separated from each other The time taken in 
passing from one stage to another is shortened so is the labour that effectuates this passage In 
comparison with a handicraft productive power is gained and this gain is owing to the general 
cooperative  character  of  manufacture  On  the  other  hand  division  of  labour  which  is  the 
distinguishing principle of manufacture requires the isolation of the various stages of production 
and  their  independence  of  each  other  The  establishment  and  maintenance  of  a  connexion 
between the isolated functions necessitates the incessant transport of the article from one hand to 
another and from one process to another From the standpoint of modern mechanical industry 
this necessity stands forth as a characteristic and costly disadvantage and one that is immanent in 
the principle of manufacture  
If we confine our attention to some particular lot of raw materials of rags for instance in paper 
manufacture or of wire in needle manufacture we perceive that it passes in succession through a 
series of stages in the hands of the various detail workmen until completion On the other hand if 
we look at the workshop as a whole we see the raw material in all the stages of its production at 
the same time The collective labourer with one set of his many hands armed with one kind of 
tools  draws  the  wire  with  another  set  armed  with  different  tools  he  at  the  same  time 
straightens  it  with  another  he  cuts  it  with  another  points  it  and  so  on  The  different  detail 
processes which were successive in time have become simultaneous go on side by side in space 
Hence  production  of  a  greater  quantum  of  finished  commodities  in  a  given  time  This 
simultaneity  it  is  true is due  to  the  general  cooperative  form  of  the  process as  a  whole  but 
Manufacture not only finds the conditions for cooperation ready to hand it also to some extent 
creates  them  by  the  subdivision  of  handicraft  labour  On  the  other  hand  it  accomplishes  this 
social  organisation  of  the  labourprocess  only  by  riveting  each  labourer  to  a  single  fractional 
detail  
Since the fractional product of each detail labourer is at the same time only a particular stage in 
the development of one and the same finished article each labourer or each group of labourers 
prepares the raw material for another labourer or group The result of the labour of the one is the 
startingpoint for the labour of the other The one workman therefore gives occupation directly to 
the other The labourtime necessary in each partial process for attaining the desired effect is 
learnt by experience and the mechanism of Manufacture as a whole is based on the assumption 
that a given result will be obtained in a given time It is only on this assumption that the various 
supplementary labourprocesses can proceed uninterruptedly simultaneously and side by side It 
is clear that this direct dependence of the operations and therefore of the labourers on each other 
compels  each  one  of  them  to  spend on  his  work  no  more  than the necessary  time  and  thus a 
continuity uniformity regularity order and even intensity of labour of quite a different kind 
is begotten than is to be found in an independent handicraft or even in simple cooperation The 

 

 

Chapter  
 
rule  that  the  labourtime  expended  on  a  commodity  should  not  exceed  that  which  is  socially 
necessary  for  its  production  appears  in  the  production  of  commodities  generally  to  be 
established  by  the  mere  effect  of  competition  since  to  express  ourselves  superficially  each 
single  producer  is  obliged  to  sell  his  commodity  at  its  marketprice  In  Manufacture  on  the 
contrary the turning out of a given quantum of product in a given time is a technical law of the 
process of production itself  
Different operations take however unequal periods and yield therefore in equal times unequal 
quantities of fractional products If therefore the same labourer has day after day to perform the 
same operation there must be a different number of labourers for each operation for instance in 
type manufacture there are four founders and two breakers to one rubber the founder casts  
type an hour the breaker breaks up  and the rubber polishes  Here we have again the 
principle of cooperation in its simplest form the simultaneous employment of many doing the 
same  thing  only  now  this  principle  is  the  expression  of  an  organic  relation  The  division  of 
labour as carried out in Manufacture not only simplifies and multiplies the qualitatively different 
parts of the social collective labourer but also creates a fixed mathematical relation or ratio which 
regulates the quantitative extent of those parts ie the relative number of labourers or the relative 
size of the group of labourers for each detail operation It develops along with the qualitative 
subdivision of the social labourprocess a quantitative rule and proportionality for that process  
When once the most fitting proportion has been experimentally established for the numbers of the 
detail labourers in the various groups when producing on a given scale that scale can be extended 
only  by  employing  a  multiple  of  each  particular  group  There  is  this  to  boot  that  the  same 
individual can do certain kinds of work just as well on a large as on a small scale for instance 
the labour of superintendence the carriage of the fractional product from one stage to the next 
c  The  isolation  of  such  functions  their  allotment  to  a  particular  labourer  does  not  become 
advantageous till after an increase in the number of labourers employed but this increase must 
affect every group proportionally  
The isolated group of labourers to whom any particular detail function is assigned is made up of 
homogeneous  elements  and  is  one  of  the  constituent  parts  of  the  total  mechanism  In  many 
manufactures  however  the  group  itself  is  an  organised  body  of  labour  the  total  mechanism 
being  a  repetition  or  multiplication  of  these  elementary  organisms  Take  for  instance  the 
manufacture of glass bottles It may be resolved into three essentially different stages First the 
preliminary stage consisting of the preparation of the components of the glass mixing the sand 
and  lime  c  and  melting  them  into  a  fluid  mass  of  glass  Various  detail  labourers  are 
employed  in  this  first  stage  as  also  in  the  final  one  of  removing  the  bottles  from  the  drying 
furnace sorting and packing them c In the middle between these two stages comes the glass 
melting proper the manipulation of the fluid mass At each mouth of the furnace there works a 
group called the hole consisting of one bottlemaker or finisher one blower one gatherer one 
putterup or whetteroff and one takerin These five detail workers are so many special organs of 
a single working organism that acts only as a whole and therefore can operate only by the direct 
cooperation  of  the  whole  five  The  whole  body  is  paralysed  if  but  one  of  its  members  be 
wanting  But  a  glass  furnace  has  several  openings  in  England  from    to    each  of  which 
contains an earthenware meltingpot full of molten glass and employs a similar fivemembered 
group of workers The organisation of each group is based on division of labour but the bond 
between  the  different  groups  is  simple  cooperation  which  by  using  in  common  one  of  the 
means of production the furnace causes it to be more economically consumed Such a furnace 
with its  groups constitutes a glass house and a glass manufactory comprises a number of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
such  glass  houses  together  with  the  apparatus  and  workmen  requisite  for  the  preparatory  and 
final stages  
Finally just as Manufacture arises in part from the combination of various handicrafts so too it 
develops into a combination of various manufactures The larger English glass manufacturers for 
instance make their own earthenware meltingpots because on the quality of these depends to a 
great  extent  the  success  or  failure  of  the  process  The  manufacture  of  one  of  the  means  of 
production  is  here  united  with  that  of  the  product  On  the  other  hand  the  manufacture  of  the 
product may be united with other manufactures of which that product is the raw material or with 
the products of which it is itself subsequently mixed Thus we find the manufacture of flint glass 
combined with that of glass cutting and brass founding the latter for the metal settings of various 
articles of glass The various manufactures so combined form more or less separate departments 
of  a  larger  manufacture  but  are  at  the  same  time  independent  processes  each  with  its  own 
division of labour In spite of the many advantages offered by this combination of manufactures 
it never grows into a complete technical system on its own foundation That happens only on its 
transformation into an industry carried on by machinery  
Early  in  the  manufacturing  period  the  principle  of  lessening  the  necessary  labourtime  in  the 
production of commodities was accepted and formulated and the use of machines especially 
for certain simple first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale and with the 
application  of  great  force  sprang  up  here  and  there  Thus  at  an  early  period  in  paper 
manufacture  the  tearing  up  of  the  rags  was  done  by  papermills  and  in  metal  works  the 
pounding of the ores was effected by stamping mills The Roman Empire had handed down the 
elementary form of all machinery in the waterwheel  
The handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the compass of gunpowder of 
typeprinting and of the automatic clock But on the whole machinery played that subordinate 
part which Adam Smith assigns to it in comparison with division of labour The sporadic use of 
machinery  in  the  th  century  was  of  the  greatest  importance  because  it  supplied  the  great 
mathematicians of that time with a practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of 
mechanics  
The  collective  labourer  formed  by  the  combination  of  a  number  of  detail  labourers  is  the 
machinery specially characteristic of the manufacturing period The various operations that are 
performed in turns by the producer of a commodity and coalesce one with another during the 
progress of production lay claim to him in various ways In one operation he must exert more 
strength  in  another  more  skill  in  another  more  attention  and  the  same  individual  does  not 
possess  all  these  qualities  in  an  equal  degree  After  Manufacture  has  once  separated  made 
independent  and  isolated  the  various  operations  the  labourers  are  divided  classified  and 
grouped according to their predominating qualities If their natural endowments are on the one 
hand the foundation on which the division of labour is built up on the other hand Manufacture 
once  introduced  develops  in  them  new  powers  that  are  by  nature  fitted  only  for  limited  and 
special functions The collective labourer now possesses in an equal degree of excellence all the 
qualities  requisite  for  production  and  expends  them  in  the  most  economical  manner  by 
exclusively employing all his organs consisting of particular labourers or groups of labourers in 
performing their special functions The onesidedness and the deficiencies of the detail labourer 
become perfections when he is a part of the collective labourer The habit of doing only one 
thing  converts  him  into  a  never  failing  instrument  while  his  connexion  with  the  whole 
mechanism compels him to work with the regularity of the parts of a machine  
Since  the  collective  labourer  has  functions  both  simple  and  complex  both  high  and  low  his 
members the individual labourpowers require different degrees of training and must therefore 
 

 

Chapter  
 
have different values Manufacture therefore develops a hierarchy of labourpowers to which 
there corresponds a scale of wages If on the one hand the individual labourers are appropriated 
and  annexed  for  life  by  a  limited  function  on  the  other  hand  the  various  operations  of  the 
hierarchy are parcelled out among the labourers according to both their natural and their acquired 
capabilities  Every  process  of  production  however  requires  certain  simple  manipulations 
which every man is capable of doing They too are now severed from their connexion with the 
more pregnant moments of activity and ossified into exclusive functions of specially appointed 
labourers Hence Manufacture begets in every handicraft that it seizes upon a class of socalled 
unskilled labourers a class which handicraft industry strictly excluded If it develops a onesided 
speciality  into  a  perfection  at  the  expense  of  the  whole  of  a  mans  working  capacity  it  also 
begins  to  make  a  speciality  of  the  absence  of  all  development  Alongside  of  the  hierarchic 
gradation  there  steps  the  simple  separation  of  the labourers  into  skilled  and  unskilled  For the 
latter the cost of apprenticeship vanishes for the former it diminishes compared with that of 
artificers  in  consequence of  the functions being  simplified  In  both cases the value  of  labour
power falls An exception to this law holds good whenever the decomposition of the labour
process begets new and comprehensive functions that either had no place at all or only a very 
modest one in handicrafts The fall in the value of labourpower caused by the disappearance or 
diminution of the expenses of apprenticeship implies a direct increase of surplusvalue for the 
benefit  of  capital  for  everything  that  shortens  the  necessary  labourtime  required  for  the 
reproduction of labourpower extends the domain of surplus labour  
Section  Division of Labour in Manufacture and Division of 

Labour in Society 

We first considered the origin of Manufacture then its simple elements then the detail labourer 
and his implements and finally the totality of the mechanism We shall now lightly touch upon 
the  relation  between  the  division  of  labour  in  manufacture  and  the  social  division  of  labour 
which forms the foundation of all production of commodities  
If we keep labour alone in view we may designate the separation of social production into its 
main divisions or genera  viz agriculture industries c as division of labour in general and 
the splitting up of these families into species and subspecies as division of labour in particular 
and the division of labour within the workshop as division of labour in singular or in detail  
Division of labour in a society and the corresponding tying down of individuals to a particular 
calling develops itself just as does the division of labour in manufacture from opposite starting
points Within a family and after further development within a tribe there springs up naturally 
a division of labour caused by differences of sex and age a division that is consequently based 
on a purely physiological foundation which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of 
the  community  by  the  increase  of  population  and  more  especially  by  the  conflicts  between 
different tribes and the subjugation of one tribe by another On the other hand as I have before 
remarked  the  exchange  of  products  springs  up  at  the  points  where  different  families  tribes 
communities come in contact for in the beginning of civilisation it is not private individuals but 
families tribes c that meet on an independent footing Different communities find different 
means  of  production  and  different  means  of  subsistence  in  their  natural  environment  Hence 
their modes of production and of living and their products are different It is this spontaneously 
developed difference which when different communities come in contact calls forth the mutual 
exchange of products and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into commodities 
Exchange does not create the differences between the spheres of production but brings what are 

 

 

Chapter  
 
already different into relation and thus converts them into more or less interdependent branches 
of the collective production of an enlarged society In the latter case the social division of labour 
arises  from  the  exchange  between  spheres  of  production  that  are  originally  distinct  and 
independent  of  one  another  In  the  former  where  the  physiological  division  of  labour  is  the 
startingpoint the particular organs of a compact whole grow loose and break off principally 
owing to the exchange of commodities with foreign communities and then isolate themselves so 
far that the sole bond still connecting the various kinds of work is the exchange of the products 
as commodities In the one case it is the making dependent what was before independent in the 
other case the making independent what was before dependent  
The  foundation  of  every  division  of  labour  that  is  well  developed  and  brought  about  by  the 
exchange of commodities is the separation between town and country It may be said that the 
whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this antithesis We pass it 
over however for the present  
Just as a certain number of simultaneously employed labourers are the material prerequisites for 
division of labour in manufacture so are the number and density of the population which here 
correspond to the agglomeration in one workshop a necessary condition for the division of labour 
in  society  Nevertheless  this  density  is  more  or  less  relative  A  relatively  thinly  populated 
country  with  welldeveloped  means  of  communication  has  a  denser  population  than  a  more 
numerously populated country with badlydeveloped means of communication and in this sense 
the Northern States of the American Union for instance are more thickly populated than India  
Since  the  production  and  the  circulation  of  commodities  are  the  general  prerequisites  of  the 
capitalist mode of production division of labour in manufacture demands that division of labour 
in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development Inversely the 
former  division  reacts  upon  and  develops  and  multiplies  the  latter  Simultaneously  with  the 
differentiation of the instruments of labour the industries that produce these instruments become 
more  and  more  differentiated  If  the  manufacturing  system  seize  upon  an  industry  which 
previously was carried on in connexion with others either as a chief or as a subordinate industry 
and  by  one  producer  these  industries  immediately  separate  their  connexion  and  become 
independent If it seize upon a particular stage in the production of a commodity the other stages 
of  its  production  become  converted  into  so  many  independent  industries  It  has  already  been 
stated that  where  the  finished  article  consists  merely  of  a  number  of parts fitted  together  the 
detail  operations  may  reestablish  themselves  as  genuine  and  separate  handicrafts  In  order  to 
carry out more perfectly the division of labour in manufacture a single branch of production is 
according  to  the  varieties of  its raw  material  or  the  various forms  that one and  the same  raw 
material  may  assume  split  up  into  numerous  and  to  some  extent  entirely  new  manufactures 
Accordingly in France alone in the first half of the th century over  different kinds of silk 
stuffs were woven and in Avignon it was law that every apprentice should devote himself to 
only  one  sort  of  fabrication  and  should  not  learn  the  preparation  of  several  kinds  of  stuff  at 
once The territorial division of labour which confines special branches of production to special 
districts  of  a  country  acquires  fresh  stimulus  from  the  manufacturing  system  which  exploits 
every special advantage The Colonial system and the opening out of the markets of the world 
both of which are included in the general conditions of existence of the manufacturing period 
furnish rich material for developing the division of labour in society It is not the place here to 
go on to show how division of labour seizes upon not only the economic but every other sphere 
of society and everywhere lays the foundation of that all engrossing system of specialising and 
sorting men that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties 

 

 

Chapter  
 
which caused A Ferguson the master of Adam Smith to exclaim We make a nation of Helots 
and have no free citizens  
But  in  spite  of  the  numerous  analogies  and  links  connecting  them  division  of  labour  in  the 
interior of a society and that in the interior of a workshop differ not only in degree but also in 
kind The analogy appears most indisputable where there is an invisible bond uniting the various 
branches of trade For instance the cattlebreeder produces hides the tanner makes the hides into 
leather and the shoemaker the leather into boots Here the thing produced by each of them is but 
a  step  towards  the  final  form  which  is  the  product  of  all  their  labours  combined  There  are 
besides all the various industries that supply the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker 
with the means of production Now it is quite possible to imagine with Adam Smith that the 
difference between the above social division of labour and the division in manufacture is merely 
subjective exists merely for the observer who in a manufacture can see with one glance all the 
numerous  operations  being  performed  on  one  spot  while  in  the  instance  given  above  the 
spreading out of the work over great areas and the great number of people employed in each 
branch  of  labour  obscure  the  connexion  But  what  is  it  that  forms  the  bond  between  the 
independent labours of the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker It is the fact that their 
respective products are commodities What on the other hand characterises division of labour in 
manufactures The fact that the detail labourer produces no commodities It is only the common 
product of all the detail labourers that becomes a commodity Division of labour in society is 
brought about by the purchase and sale of the products of different branches of industry while the 
connexion between the detail operations in a workshop is due to the sale of the labourpower of 
several  workmen  to  one  capitalist  who  applies  it  as  combined  labourpower  The  division  of 
labour  in  the  workshop  implies  concentration  of  the  means  of  production  in  the  hands  of  one 
capitalist  the  division  of  labour  in  society  implies  their  dispersion  among  many  independent 
producers of commodities While within the workshop the iron law of proportionality subjects 
definite numbers of workmen to definite functions in the society outside the workshop chance 
and caprice have full play in distributing the producers and their means of production among the 
various branches of industry The different spheres of production it is true constantly tend to an 
equilibrium for on the one hand while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a use
value to satisfy a particular social want and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively 
still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system and that 
system one of spontaneous growth and on the other hand the law of the value of commodities 
ultimately  determines  how  much  of  its  disposable  workingtime  society  can  expend  on  each 
particular class of commodities But this constant tendency to equilibrium of the various spheres 
of production is exercised only in the shape of a reaction against the constant upsetting of this 
equilibrium  The  a  priori  system  on  which  the  division  of  labour  within  the  workshop  is 
regularly carried out becomes in the division of labour within the society an a posteriori nature
imposed  necessity  controlling  the  lawless  caprice  of  the  producers  and  perceptible  in  the 
barometrical fluctuations of the marketprices Division of labour within the workshop implies 
the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men that are but parts of a mechanism that belongs 
to  him  The  division  of  labour  within  the  society  brings  into  contact  independent  commodity
producers who acknowledge no other authority but that of competition of the coercion exerted 
by the pressure of their mutual interests just as in the animal kingdom the bellum omnium contra 
omnes  war  of  all  against  all    Hobbes  more  or  less  preserves  the  conditions  of  existence  of 
every species The same bourgeois mind which praises division of labour in the workshop life
long annexation of the labourer to a partial operation and his complete subjection to capital as 
being  an  organisation  of  labour  that  increases  its  productiveness    that  same  bourgeois  mind 
denounces with equal vigour every conscious attempt to socially control and regulate the process 
 

 

Chapter  
 
of  production  as  an  inroad  upon  such  sacred  things  as  the  rights  of  property  freedom  and 
unrestricted  play  for  the  bent  of  the  individual  capitalist  It  is  very  characteristic  that  the 
enthusiastic apologists of the factory system have nothing more damning to urge against a general 
organisation of the labour of society than that it would turn all society into one immense factory  
If in a society with capitalist production anarchy in the social division of labour and despotism 
in that of the workshop are mutual conditions the one of the other we find on the contrary in 
those earlier forms of society in which the separation of trades has been spontaneously developed 
then  crystallised  and  finally  made  permanent  by  law  on  the  one  hand  a  specimen  of  the 
organisation of the labour of society in accordance with an approved and authoritative plan and 
on the other the entire exclusion of division of labour in the workshop or at all events a mere

Those small and extremely ancient Indian communities some of which have continued down to 
this  day  are  based  on  possession  in  common  of  the  land  on  the  blending  of  agriculture  and 
handicrafts and on an unalterable division of labour which serves whenever a new community 
is started as a plan and scheme ready cut and dried Occupying areas of from  up to several 
thousand  acres  each  forms  a  compact  whole  producing  all  it  requires  The  chief  part  of  the 
products  is  destined  for  direct  use  by  the  community  itself  and  does  not  take  the  form  of  a 
commodity Hence production here is independent of that division of labour brought about in 
Indian society as a whole by means of the exchange of commodities It is the surplus alone that 
becomes a commodity and a portion of even that not until it has reached the hands of the State 
into whose hands from time immemorial a certain quantity of these products has found its way in 
the shape of rent in kind The constitution of these communities varies in different parts of India 
In those of the simplest form the land is tilled in common and the produce divided among the 
members At the same time spinning and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary 
industries Side by side with the masses thus occupied with one and the same work we find the 
chief inhabitant who is judge police and taxgatherer in one the bookkeeper who keeps the 
accounts of the tillage and registers everything relating thereto another official who prosecutes 
criminals protects strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village the boundary 
man  who  guards  the  boundaries  against  neighbouring  communities  the  wateroverseer  who 
distributes  the  water  from  the  common  tanks  for  irrigation  the  Brahmin  who  conducts  the 
religious services the schoolmaster who on the sand teaches the children reading and writing 
the calendarBrahmin or astrologer who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seedtime 
and harvest and for every other kind of agricultural work a smith and a carpenter who make and 
repair all the agricultural implements the potter who makes all the pottery of the village the 
barber the washerman who washes clothes the silversmith here and there the poet who in some 
communities  replaces  the  silversmith  in  others  the  schoolmaster  This  dozen  of  individuals  is 
maintained at the expense of the whole community If the population increases a new community 
is founded on the pattern of the old one on unoccupied land The whole mechanism discloses a 
systematic  division  of  labour  but  a  division like  that  in  manufactures is  impossible since  the 
smith and the carpenter c find an unchanging market and at the most there occur according 
to  the  sizes  of  the  villages  two  or  three  of  each  instead  of  one  The  law  that  regulates  the 
division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of Nature at the 
same  time  that  each  individual  artificer  the  smith  the  carpenter  and  so  on  conducts  in  his 
workshop  all  the  operations  of  his  handicraft  in  the  traditional  way  but  independently  and 
without recognising any authority over him The simplicity of the organisation for production in 
these  selfsufficing  communities  that  constantly  reproduce  themselves  in  the  same  form  and 
when  accidentally  destroyed  spring  up  again  on  the  spot  and  with  the  same  name    this

simplicity  supplies  the  key  to  the  secret  of  the  unchangeableness  of  Asiatic  societies  an 
unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of Asiatic 
States  and  the  neverceasing  changes  of  dynasty  The  structure  of  the  economic  elements  of 
society remains untouched by the stormclouds of the political sky  
The rules of the guilds as I have said before by limiting most strictly the number of apprentices 
and journeymen that a single master could employ prevented him from becoming a capitalist 
Moreover he could not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which 
he was a master The guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants 
the only form of free capital with which they came in contact A merchant could buy every kind 
of commodity but labour as a commodity he could not buy He existed only on sufferance as a 
dealer in the products of the handicrafts If circumstances called for a further division of labour 
the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties or founded new guilds by the side of the old 
ones all this however without concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop Hence 
the  guild  organisation  however  much  it  may  have  contributed  by  separating  isolating  and 
perfecting  the  handicrafts  to  create  the  material  conditions  for  the  existence  of  manufacture 
excluded  division  of  labour  in  the  workshop  On  the  whole  the  labourer  and  his  means  of 
production remained closely united like the snail with its shell and thus there was wanting the 
principal basis of manufacture the separation of the labourer from his means of production and 
the conversion of these means into capital  
While division of labour in society at large whether such division be brought about or not by 
exchange  of  commodities  is  common  to  economic  formations  of  society  the  most  diverse 
division  of  labour  in  the  workshop  as  practised  by  manufacture  is  a  special  creation  of  the 
capitalist mode of production alone  

Section  The Capitalistic Character of Manufacture 

An increased number of labourers under the control of one capitalist is the natural startingpoint 
as well of cooperation generally as of manufacture in particular But the division of labour in 
manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical necessity The minimum 
number  that  any  given  capitalist  is  bound  to  employ  is  here  prescribed  by  the  previously 
established  division  of  labour  On  the  other  hand  the  advantages  of  further  division  are 
obtainable  only  by  adding  to  the  number  of  workmen  and  this  can  be  done  only  by  adding 
multiples of the various detail groups But an increase in the variable component of the capital 
employed necessitates an increase in its constant component too in the workshops implements 
c and in particular in the raw material the call for which grows quicker than the number of 
workmen The quantity of it consumed in a given time by a given amount of labour increases in 
the same ratio as does the productive power of that labour in consequence of its division Hence 
it is a law based on the very nature of manufacture that the minimum amount of capital which is 
bound  to  be  in  the  hands  of  each  capitalist  must  keep  increasing  in  other  words  that  the 
transformation  into  capital  of  the  social  means  of  production  and  subsistence  must  keep 
extending  
In manufacture as well as in simple cooperation the collective working organism is a form of 
existence  of  capital  The  mechanism  that  is  made  up  of  numerous  individual  detail  labourers 
belongs to the capitalist Hence the productive power resulting from a combination of labours 
appears  to  be  the  productive  power  of  capital  Manufacture  proper  not  only  subjects  the 
previously  independent  workman  to  the  discipline  and  command  of  capital  but  in  addition 
creates a hierarchic gradation of the workmen themselves While simple cooperation leaves the 
mode  of  working  by  the  individual  for  the  most  part  unchanged  manufacture  thoroughly

revolutionises it and seizes labourpower by its very roots It converts the labourer into a crippled 
monstrosity by forcing his detail dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities 
and instincts just as in the States of La Plata they butcher a whole beast for the sake of his hide or 
his tallow Not only is the detail work distributed to the different individuals but the individual 
himself is made the automatic motor of a fractional operation and the absurd fable of Menenius 
Agrippa which makes man a mere fragment of his own body becomes realised If at first the 
workman sells his labourpower to capital because the material means of producing a commodity 
fail  him  now  his  very  labourpower  refuses  its  services  unless  it  has  been  sold  to  capital  Its 
functions can be exercised only in an environment that exists in the workshop of the capitalist 
after  the  sale  By  nature  unfitted  to  make  anything  independently  the  manufacturing  labourer 
develops productive activity as a mere appendage of the capitalists workshop As the chosen 
people  bore  in  their  features  the  sign  manual  of  Jehovah  so  division  of  labour  brands  the 
manufacturing workman as the property of capital  
The  knowledge  the  judgement  and  the  will  which  though  in  ever  so  small  a  degree  are 
practised by the independent peasant or handicraftsman in the same way as the savage makes the 
whole art of war consist in the exercise of his personal cunning these faculties are now required 
only for the workshop as a whole Intelligence in production expands in one direction because it 
vanishes in many others What is lost by the detail labourers is concentrated in the capital that 
employs  them  It  is  a  result  of  the  division  of  labour  in  manufactures  that  the  labourer  is 
brought face to face with the intellectual potencies of the material process of production as the 
property of another and as a ruling power This separation begins in simple cooperation where 
the capitalist represents to the single workman the oneness and the will of the associated labour 
It is developed in manufacture which cuts down the labourer into a detail labourer It is completed 
in modern industry which makes science a productive force distinct from labour and presses it 
into the service of capital  
In manufacture in order to make the collective labourer and through him capital rich in social 
productive power each labourer must be made poor in individual productive powers 
Ignorance is the mother of industry as well as of superstition Reflection and 
fancy are subject to err but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent 
of either Manufactures accordingly prosper most where the mind is least 
consulted and where the workshop may  be considered as an engine the parts of 
which are men  

As  a  matter  of  fact  some  few  manufacturers  in  the  middle  of  the  th  century  preferred  for 
certain operations that were trade secrets to employ halfidiotic persons  

The understandings of the greater part of men says Adam Smith are 
necessarily formed by their ordinary employments The man whose whole life is 
spent in performing a few simple operations  has no occasion to exert his 
understanding He generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a 
human creature to become  

After describing the stupidity of the detail labourer he goes on 

The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind 
It corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his 
strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employments than that to 
which he has been bred His dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this 
manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual social and martial

virtues But in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which the 
labouring poor that is the great body of the people must necessarily fall  

For preventing the complete deterioration of the great mass of the people by division of labour A 
Smith  recommends  education  of  the  people  by  the  State  but  prudently  and  in  homeopathic 
doses G Garnier his French translator and commentator who under the first French Empire 
quite naturally developed into a senator quite as naturally opposes him on this point Education 
of the masses he urges violates the first law of the division of labour and with it 

our whole social system would be proscribed Like all other divisions of 
labour he says that between hand labour and head labour  is more 
pronounced and decided in proportion as society he rightly uses this word for 
capital landed property and their State becomes richer This division of labour 
like every other is an effect of past and a cause of future progress ought the 
government then to work in opposition to this division of labour and to hinder its 
natural course Ought it to expend a part of the public money in the attempt to 
confound and blend together two classes of labour which are striving after 
division and separation  

Some  crippling  of  body  and  mind  is  inseparable  even  from  division  of  labour  in  society  as  a 
whole  Since  however  manufacture  carries  this  social  separation  of  branches  of  labour  much 
further and also by its peculiar division attacks the individual at the very roots of his life it is 
the first to afford the materials for and to give a start to industrial pathology  

To subdivide a man is to execute him if he deserves the sentence to assassinate 
him if he does not The subdivision of labour is the assassination of a people  

Cooperation  based  on  division  of  labour  in  other  words  manufacture  commences  as  a 
spontaneous  formation  So  soon  as  it  attains  some  consistence  and  extension  it  becomes  the 
recognised  methodical  and  systematic  form  of  capitalist  production  History  shows  how  the 
division of labour peculiar to manufacture strictly so called acquires the best adapted form at 
first by experience as it were behind the backs of the actors and then like the guild handicrafts 
strives  to  hold fast  that  form  when  once  found  and  here  and  there  succeeds  in  keeping  it  for 
centuries Any alteration in this form except in trivial matters is solely owing to a revolution in 
the instruments of labour Modern manufacture wherever it arises  I do not here allude to modern 
industry based on machinery  either finds the disjecta membra poetae ready to hand and only 
waiting to be collected together as is the case in the manufacture of clothes in large towns or it 
can easily apply the principle of division simply by exclusively assigning the various operations 
of a handicraft such as bookbinding to particular men In such cases a weeks experience is 
enough to determine the proportion between the numbers of the hands necessary for the various 
functions  
By decomposition of handicrafts by specialisation of the instruments of labour by the formation 
of detail labourers and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism division of 
labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation and a quantitative proportion in the social 
process of production it consequently creates a definite organisation of the labour of society and 
thereby develops at the same time new productive forces in the society In its specific capitalist 
form    and  under  the  given  conditions  it  could  take  no  other  form  than  a  capitalistic  one   
manufacture is but a particular method of begetting relative surplusvalue or of augmenting at the 
expense of the labourer the selfexpansion of capital  usually called social wealth Wealth of 
Nations c It increases the social productive power of labour not only for the benefit of the 
capitalist instead of for that of the labourer but it does this by crippling the individual labourers 
It creates new conditions for the lordship of capital over labour If therefore on the one hand it 
 

 

Chapter  
 
presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the economic development of 
society on the other hand it is a refined and civilised method of exploitation  
Political Economy which as an independent science first sprang into being during the period of 
manufacture views the social division of labour only from the standpoint of manufacture and 
sees in it only the means of producing more commodities with a given quantity of labour and 
consequently of cheapening commodities and hurrying on the accumulation of capital In most 
striking  contrast  with  this  accentuation  of  quantity  and  exchangevalue  is  the  attitude  of  the 
writers of classical antiquity who hold exclusively by quality and usevalue In consequence of 
the  separation  of  the  social  branches  of  production  commodities  are  better  made  the  various 
bents and talents of men select a suitable field and without some restraint no important results 
can  be  obtained  anywhere  Hence  both  product  and  producer  are  improved  by  division  of 
labour If the growth of the quantity produced is occasionally mentioned this is only done with 
reference to the greater abundance of usevalues There is not a word alluding to exchangevalue 
or to the cheapening of commodities This aspect from the standpoint of usevalue alone is taken 
as  well  by  Plato    who  treats  division  of  labour  as  the  foundation  on  which  the  division  of 
society  into  classes  is  based  as  by  Xenophon  who  with  characteristic  bourgeois  instinct 
approaches more nearly to division of labour within the workshop Platos Republic in so far as 
division of labour is treated in it as the formative principle of the State is merely the Athenian 
idealisation of the Egyptian system of castes Egypt having served as the model of an industrial 
country to many of his contemporaries also amongst others to Isocrates and it continued to 
have this importance to the Greeks of the Roman Empire  
During  the  manufacturing  period  proper  ie  the  period  during  which  manufacture  is  the 
predominant  form  taken  by  capitalist  production  many  obstacles  are  opposed  to  the  full 
development  of  the  peculiar  tendencies  of  manufacture  Although  manufacture  creates  as  we 
have already seen a simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled simultaneously 
with their hierarchic arrangement in classes yet the number of the unskilled labourers owing to 
the preponderating influence of the skilled remains very limited Although it adapts the detail 
operations to the various degrees of maturity strength and development of the living instruments 
of labour thus conducing to exploitation of women and children yet this tendency as a whole is 
wrecked  on  the  habits  and  the  resistance  of  the  male  labourers  Although  the  splitting  up  of 
handicrafts lowers the cost of forming the workman and thereby lowers his value yet for the 
more  difficult  detail  work  a  longer  apprenticeship  is  necessary  and  even  where  it  would  be 
superfluous is jealously insisted upon by the workmen In England for instance we find the laws 
of  apprenticeship  with  their  seven  years  probation  in  full  force  down  to  the  end  of  the 
manufacturing period and they are not thrown on one side till the advent of Modern Industry 
Since handicraft skill is the foundation of manufacture and since the mechanism of manufacture 
as  a  whole  possesses  no framework  apart  from  the labourers themselves capital is constantly 
compelled to wrestle with the insubordination of the workmen  

By the infirmity of human nature says friend Ure it happens that the more 
skilful the workman the more selfwilled and intractable he is apt to become and 
of course the less fit a component of a mechanical system in which  he may do 
great damage to the whole 

Hence throughout the whole manufacturing period there runs the complaint of want of discipline 
among the workmen And had we not the testimony of contemporary writers the simple facts 
that during the period between the th century and the epoch of Modern Industry capital failed 
to become the master of the whole disposable workingtime of the manufacturing labourers that 
manufactures  are  shortlived  and  change  their  locality  from  one  country  to  another  with  the

or  another  be  established  exclaims  in    the  oftcited  author  of  the  Essay  on  Trade  and 
Commerce  Order  reechoes  Dr  Andrew  Ure    years  later  Order  was  wanting  in 
manufacture  based  on  the  scholastic  dogma  of  division  of  labour  and  Arkwright  created 
order  
At the same time manufacture was unable either to seize upon the production of society to its full 
extent or to revolutionise that production to its very core It towered up as an economic work of 
art on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts and of the rural domestic industries At a 
given stage in its development the narrow technical basis on which manufacture rested came 
into conflict with requirements of production that were created by manufacture itself  
One  of  its  most  finished  creations  was  the  workshop  for  the  production  of  the  instruments  of 
labour  themselves  including  especially  the  complicated  mechanical  apparatus  then  already 
employed 

A machinefactory says Ure displayed the division of labour in manifold 
gradations  the file the drill the lathe having each its different workman in the 
order of skill P  

This  workshop  the  product  of  the  division  of  labour  in  manufacture  produced  in  its  turn   
machines  It  is they  that  sweep  away  the  handicraftsmans  work  as  the  regulating  principle of 
social production Thus on the one hand the technical reason for the lifelong annexation of the 
workman to a detail function is removed On the other hand the fetters that this same principle 
laid on the dominion of capital fall away

 When from the peculiar nature of the produce of each manufactory the number of processes into 
which it is most advantageous to divide it is ascertained as well as the number of individuals to be

subordinate part which he assigns to machinery gave occasion in the early days of modern mechanical 
industry to the polemic of Lauderdale and at a later period to that of Ure A Smith also confounds

and more sharply even than his contemporaries Babbage eg who though much his superior as a 
mathematician  and  mechanician  treated  mechanical  industry  from  the  standpoint  of  manufacture 
alone Ure says This appropriation  to each a workman of appropriate value and cost was naturally 
assigned forms the very essence of division of labour On the other hand he describes this division 
as  adaptation  of  labour  to  the  different  talents  of  men  and  lastly  characterises  the  whole 
manufacturing system as a system for the division or gradation of labour as the division of labour 
into degrees of skill c Ure lc pp  passim

 Division of labour proceeds from the separation of professions the most widely different to that 
division where several labourers divide between them the preparation of one and the same product as 
in manufacture Storch Cours dEcon Pol Paris Edn t I p  Nous rencontrons chez les

meet with three kinds of division of labour the first  which we shall call general brings about the 
division of the producers into agriculturalists manufacturers and traders it corresponds to the three 
main branches of the nations labour the second which one could call particular is the division of 
labour of each branch into species  The third division of labour which one could designate as a 
division of tasks or of labour properly so called is that which grows up in the individual crafts and 
trades  which is established in the majority of the manufactories and workshops Skarbek lc pp 
  
 Note to the third edition Subsequent very searching study of the primitive condition of man led the 
author to the conclusion that it was not the family that originally developed into the tribe but that on 
the contrary the tribe was the primitive and spontaneously developed form of human association on 
the  basis  of  blood  relationship  and  that  out of  the  first  incipient  loosening  of  the tribal  bonds  the 
many and various forms of the family were afterwards developed F E 
 Sir James Steuart is the economist who has handled this subject best How little his book which 
appeared ten years before the Wealth of Nations is known even at the present time may be judged 
from the fact that the admirers of Malthus do not even know that the first edition of the latters work 
on population contains except in the purely declamatory part very little but extracts from Steuart and 
in a less degree from Wallace and Townsend 
 There is a certain density of population which is convenient both for social intercourse and for 
that combination of powers by which the produce of labour is increased James Mill lc p  As 
the number of labourers increases the productive power of society augments in the compound ratio of

 This distinction between division of labour in society and in manufacture was practically illustrated 
to the Yankees One of the new taxes devised at Washington during the civil war was the duty of  
on  all  industrial  products  Question  What  is  an  industrial  product Answer  of  the  legislature  A 
thing is produced when it is made and it is made when it is ready for sale Now for one example 
out  of  many  The  New  York  and  Philadelphia  manufacturers  had  previously  been  in  the  habit  of 
making umbrellas with all their belongings But since an umbrella is a mixtum compositum of very 
heterogeneous parts by degrees these parts became the products of various separate industries carried 
on  independently  in  different  places  They  entered  as  separate  commodities  into  the  umbrella 
manufactory where they were fitted together The Yankees have given to articles thus fitted together 
the name of assembled articles a name they deserve for being an assemblage of taxes Thus the 
umbrella assembles first  on the price of each of its elements and a further  on its own total 
price

 It is not sufficient that the capital the writer should have said the necessary means of subsistence

must also be accumulated in the hands of the employers in sufficiently large quantities to enable them

to him various wages diverse Arbeitslhne The more or less extensive application of division of

 With Plato division of labour within the community is a development from the multifarious 
requirements  and  the  limited  capacities  of  individuals  The  main  point  with  him  is  that  the 
labourer must adapt himself to the work not the work to the labourer which latter is unavoidable 
if  he  carries  on  several  trades  at  once  thus  making  one  or  the  other  of  them  subordinate 
            
             
                
     For the workman must wait upon the work it will not wait 
upon  his  leisure  and  allow  itself  to  be  done  in  a  spare  moment    Yes  he  must  So  the 
conclusion is that more will be produced of every thing and the work will be more easily and 
better done when every man is set free from all other occupations to do at the right time the one 
thing for which he is naturally fitted Rep   Ed Baiter Orelli c So in Thucydides lc c 
 Seafaring is an art like any other and cannot as circumstances require be carried on as a 
subsidiary occupation nay other subsidiary occupations cannot be carried on alongside of this

missed and the article spoiled    If someone lets slip  The same 
Platonic idea is found recurring in the protest of the English bleachers against the clause in the

 Xenophon says it is not only an honour to receive food from the table of the King of Persia but 
such food is much more tasty than other food And there is nothing wonderful in this for as the other 
arts are brought to special perfection in the great towns so the royal food is prepared in a special way 
For in the small towns the same man makes bedsteads doors ploughs and tables often too he builds 
houses  into  the  bargain  and  is  quite  content  if  he  finds  custom  sufficient  for  his  sustenance  It  is 
altogether impossible for a man who does so many things to do them all well But in the great towns 
where each can find many buyers one trade is sufficient to maintain the man who carries it on Nay 
there is often not even need of one complete trade but one man makes shoes for men another for 
women  Here  and  there  one  man  gets  a  living  by  sewing  another  by  cutting  out  shoes  one  does 
nothing but cut out clothes another nothing but sew the pieces together It follows necessarily then 
that he who does the simplest kind of work undoubtedly does it better than anyone else So it is with 
the  art  of  cooking  Xen  Cyrop  I  viii  c    Xenophon  here  lays  stress  exclusively  upon  the 
excellence to be attained in usevalue although he well knows that the gradations of the division of 
labour depend on the extent of the market 
 He Busiris divided them all into special castes  commanded that the same individuals should 
always carry on the same trade for he knew that they who change their occupations become skilled in 
none but that those who constantly stick to one occupation bring it to the highest perfection In truth 
we shall also find that in relation to the arts and handicrafts they have outstripped their rivals more 
than  a  master  does  a  bungler  and  the  contrivances  for  maintaining  the  monarchy  and  the  other 
institutions  of  their  State  are  so  admirable  that  the  most  celebrated  philosophers  who  treat  of  this 
subject praise the constitution of the Egyptian State above all others Isocrates Busiris c

Chapter  Machinery and Modern Industry 

Section   The Development of Machinery 

John Stuart Mill says in his Principles of Political Economy 

It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the 
days toil of any human being  

That is however by no means the aim of the capitalistic application of machinery Like every 
other increase in the productiveness of labour machinery is intended to cheapen commodities 
and by shortening that portion of the working day in which the labourer works for himself to 
lengthen the other portion that he gives without an equivalent to the capitalist In short it is a 
means for producing surplusvalue 
In  manufacture  the  revolution  in  the  mode  of  production  begins  with  the  labourpower  in 
modern  industry  it  begins  with  the  instruments  of  labour  Our  first  inquiry  then  is  how  the 
instruments of labour are converted from tools into machines or what is the difference between a 
machine  and  the  implements  of  a  handicraft  We  are  only  concerned  here  with  striking  and 
general characteristics for epochs in the history of society are no more separated from each other 
by hard and fast lines of demarcation than are geological epochs  
Mathematicians and mechanicians and in this they are followed by a few English economists 
call  a  tool a  simple  machine  and  a  machine  a  complex tool They  see  no essential  difference 
between them and even give the name of machine to the simple mechanical powers the lever 
the inclined plane the screw the wedge c As a matter of fact every machine is a combination 
of those simple powers no matter how they may be disguised From the economic standpoint this 
explanation is worth nothing because the historical element is wanting Another explanation of 
the difference between tool and machine is that in the case of a tool man is the motive power 
while the motive power of a machine is something different from man as for instance an animal 
water  wind  and  so  on  According  to  this  a  plough  drawn  by  oxen  which  is  a  contrivance 
common  to  the  most  different  epochs  would  be  a  machine  while  Claussens  circular  loom 
which worked by a single labourer weaves  picks per minute would be a mere tool Nay 
this very loom though a tool when worked by hand would if worked by steam be a machine 
And  since  the  application  of  animal  power  is  one  of  mans  earliest  inventions  production  by 
machinery would have preceded production by handicrafts When in  John Wyatt brought 
out his spinning machine and began the industrial revolution of the th century not a word did 
he say about an ass driving it instead of a man and yet this part fell to the ass He described it as a 
machine to spin without fingers  
All fully developed machinery consists of three essentially different parts the motor mechanism 
the transmitting mechanism and finally the tool or working machine The motor mechanism is 
that which puts the whole in motion It either generates its own motive power like the steam
engine the caloric engine the electromagnetic machine c or it receives its impulse from some 
already  existing  natural  force  like  the  waterwheel  from  a  head  of  water  the  windmill  from 
wind  c  The  transmitting  mechanism  composed  of  flywheels  shafting  toothed  wheels 
pullies straps ropes bands pinions and gearing of the most varied kinds regulates the motion 
changes  its  form  where  necessary  as  for  instance  from  linear  to  circular  and  divides  and 
distributes  it  among  the  working  machines These two  first  parts  of  the  whole  mechanism  are 
there solely for putting the working machines in motion by means of which motion the subject

of labour is seized upon and modified as desired The tool or working machine is that part of the 
machinery  with  which  the  industrial  revolution  of  the  th  century  started  And  to  this  day  it 
constantly serves as such a startingpoint whenever a handicraft or a manufacture is turned into 
an industry carried on by machinery  
On a closer examination of the working machine proper we find in it as a general rule though 
often no doubt under very altered forms the apparatus and tools used by the handicraftsman or 
manufacturing workman with this difference that instead of being human implements they are 
the implements of a mechanism or mechanical implements Either the entire machine is only a 
more  or less  altered  mechanical  edition of  the  old handicraft  tool  as  for instance the  power
loom or the working parts fitted in the frame of the machine are old acquaintances as spindles 
are in a mule needles in a stockingloom saws in a sawingmachine and knives in a chopping 
machine The distinction between these tools and the body proper of the machine exists from 
their  very  birth  for  they  continue  for  the  most  part  to  be  produced  by  handicraft  or  by 
manufacture  and  are  afterwards  fitted  into  the  body  of  the  machine  which  is  the  product  of 
machinery  The  machine  proper  is  therefore  a  mechanism  that  after  being  set  in  motion 
performs with its tools the same operations that were formerly done by the workman with similar 
tools Whether the motive power is derived from man or from some other machine makes no 
difference in this respect From the moment that the tool proper is taken from man and fitted into 
a mechanism a machine takes the place of a mere implement The difference strikes one at once 
even  in  those  cases  where  man  himself  continues  to  be  the  prime  mover  The  number  of 
implements that he himself can use simultaneously is limited by the number of his own natural 
instruments of production by the number of his bodily organs In Germany they tried at first to 
make one spinner work two spinningwheels that is to work simultaneously with both hands and 
both feet This was too difficult Later a treddle spinningwheel with two spindles was invented 
but adepts in spinning who could spin two threads at once were almost as scarce as twoheaded 
men  The  Jenny  on  the  other  hand  even  at  its  very  birth  spun  with    spindles  and  the 
stockingloom knits with many thousand needles at once The number of tools that a machine can 
bring into play simultaneously is from the very first emancipated from the organic limits that 
hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman  
In many manual implements the distinction between man as mere motive power and man as the 
workman or operator properly so called is brought into striking contrast For instance the foot is 
merely the prime mover of the spinningwheel while the hand working with the spindle and 
drawing  and  twisting  performs  the  real  operation  of  spinning  It  is  this  last  part  of  the 
handicraftsmans implement that is first seized upon by the industrial revolution leaving to the 
workman in addition to his new labour of watching the machine with his eyes and correcting its 
mistakes with his hands the merely mechanical part of being the moving power On the other 
hand implements in regard to which man has always acted as a simple motive power as for 
instance  by  turning  the  crank  of  a  mill  by  pumping  by  moving  up  and  down  the  arm  of  a 
bellows  by  pounding  with  a  mortar  c  such  implements  soon  call  for  the  application  of 
animals  water  and  wind  as  motive  powers  Here  and  there  long  before  the  period  of 
manufacture  and  also  to  some  extent  during  that  period  these  implements  pass  over  into 
machines but without creating any revolution in the mode of production It becomes evident in 
the period of modern industry that these implements even under their form of manual tools are 
already machines For instance the pumps with which the Dutch in  emptied the Lake of 
Harlem were constructed on the principle of ordinary pumps the only difference being that their 
pistons  were  driven  by  cyclopean  steamengines  instead  of  by  men  The  common  and  very 
imperfect bellows of the blacksmith is in England occasionally converted into a blowingengine

by  connecting  its  arm  with  a  steamengine  The  steamengine  itself  such  as  it  was  at  its 
invention  during  the  manufacturing  period  at  the  close  of  the  th  century  and  such  as  it 
continued  to  be  down  to    did  not  give  rise  to  any  industrial  revolution  It  was  on  the 
contrary  the  invention  of  machines  that  made  a  revolution  in  the  form  of  steamengines 
necessary As soon as man instead of working with an implement on the subject of his labour 
becomes merely the motive power of an implementmachine it is a mere accident that motive 
power takes the disguise of human muscle and it may equally well take the form of wind water 
or steam Of course this does not prevent such a change of form from producing great technical 
alterations in the mechanism that was originally constructed to be driven by man alone Nowa
days  all  machines  that  have  their  way  to  make  such  as  sewingmachines  breadmaking 
machines  c  are  unless  from  their  very  nature  their  use  on  a  small  scale  is  excluded 
constructed to be driven both by human and by purely mechanical motive power  
The machine which is the startingpoint of the industrial revolution supersedes the workman 
who handles a single tool by a mechanism operating with a number of similar tools and set in 
motion by a single motive power whatever the form of that power may be Here we have the 
machine but only as an elementary factor of production by machinery  
Increase  in  the  size  of  the  machine  and  in  the  number  of  its  working  tools  calls  for  a  more 
massive mechanism to drive it and this mechanism requires in order to overcome its resistance 
a  mightier  moving  power  than  that  of  man  apart  from  the  fact  that  man  is  a  very  imperfect 
instrument for producing uniform continued motion But assuming that he is acting simply as a 
motor that a machine has taken the place of his tool it is evident that he can be replaced by 
natural forces Of all the great motors handed down from the manufacturing period horsepower 
is the worst partly because a horse has a head of his own partly because he is costly and the 
extent  to  which  he  is  applicable  in  factories  is  very  restricted  Nevertheless  the  horse  was 
extensively used during the infancy of modern industry This is proved as well by the complaints 
of contemporary agriculturists as by the term horsepower which has survived to this day as 
an expression for mechanical force  
Wind was too inconstant and uncontrollable and besides in England the birthplace of modern 
industry the use of water power preponderated even during the manufacturing period In the th 
century attempts had already been made to turn two pairs of millstones with a single waterwheel 
But the increased size of the gearing was too much for the water power which had now become 
insufficient and this was one of the circumstances that led to a more accurate investigation of the 
laws of friction In the same way the irregularity caused by the motive power in mills that were 
put in motion by pushing and pulling a lever led to the theory and the application of the fly
wheel which afterwards plays so important a part in modern industry In this way during the 
manufacturing  period  were  developed  the  first  scientific  and  technical  elements  of  Modern 
Mechanical Industry Arkwrights throstle spinning mill was from the very first turned by water 
But for all that the use of water as the predominant motive power was beset with difficulties It 
could  not  be  increased  at  will  it  failed  at  certain  seasons  of  the  year  and  above  all  it  was 
essentially  local  Not  till  the  invention  of  Watts  second  and  socalled  doubleacting  steam
engine was a prime mover found that begot its own force by the consumption of coal and water 
whose power was entirely under mans control that was mobile and a means of locomotion that 
was  urban  and  not  like  the  waterwheel rural that  permitted  production  to be concentrated  in 
towns instead of like the waterwheels being scattered up and down the country that was of 
universal technical application and relatively speaking little affected in its choice of residence 
by local circumstances The greatness of Watts genius showed itself in the specification of the 
patent that he took out in April  In that specification his steamengine is described not as 

 

 

Chapter  
 
an invention for a specific purpose but as an agent universally applicable in Mechanical Industry 
In  it  he  points  out  applications  many  of  which  as  for  instance  the  steamhammer  were  not 
introduced  till  half  a  century  later  Nevertheless  he  doubted  the  use  of  steamengines  in 
navigation His successors Boulton and Watt sent to the exhibition of  steamengines of 
colossal size for ocean steamers  
As soon as tools had been converted from being manual implements of man into implements of a 
mechanical apparatus of a machine the motive mechanism also acquired an independent form 
entirely emancipated from the restraints of human strength Thereupon the individual machine 
that we have hitherto been considering sinks into a mere factor in production by machinery One 
motive mechanism was now able to drive many machines at once The motive mechanism grows 
with the number of the machines that are turned simultaneously and the transmitting mechanism 
becomes a widespreading apparatus  
We now proceed to distinguish the cooperation of a number of machines of one kind from a 
complex system of machinery  
In the one case the product is entirely made by a single machine which performs all the various 
operations previously  done  by  one  handicraftsman  with  his  tool  as for  instance  by  a  weaver 
with his loom or by several handicraftsman successively either separately or as members of a 
system  of  Manufacture  For  example  in  the  manufacture  of  envelopes  one  man  folded  the 
paper with the folder another laid on the gum a third turned the flap over on which the device is 
impressed a fourth embossed the device and so on and for each of these operations the envelope 
had to change hands One single envelope machine now performs all these operations at once 
and makes more than  envelopes in an hour In the London exhibition of  there was an 
American machine for making paper cornets It cut the paper pasted folded and finished  in 
a minute Here the whole process which when carried on as Manufacture was split up into and 
carried out by a series of operations is completed by a single machine working a combination of 
various tools Now whether such a machine be merely a reproduction of a complicated manual 
implement or a combination of various simple implements specialised by Manufacture in either 
case in the factory ie in the workshop in which machinery alone is used we meet again with 
simple  cooperation  and  leaving  the  workman  out  of  consideration  for  the  moment  this  co
operation presents itself to us in the first instance as the conglomeration in one place of similar 
and  simultaneously  acting  machines  Thus  a  weaving  factory  is  constituted  of  a  number  of 
powerlooms working side by side and a sewing factory of a number of sewingmachines all in 
the same building But there is here a technical oneness in the whole system owing to all the 
machines receiving their impulse simultaneously and in an equal degree from the pulsations of 
the  common  prime  mover  by  the  intermediary  of  the  transmitting  mechanism  and  this 
mechanism to a certain extent is also common to them all since only particular ramifications of 
it branch off to each machine Just as a number of tools then form the organs of a machine so a 
number of machines of one kind constitute the organs of the motive mechanism  
A real machinery system however does not take the place of these independent machines until 
the subject of labour goes through a connected series of detail processes that are carried out by a 
chain of machines of various kinds the one supplementing the other Here we have again the co
operation by division of labour that characterises Manufacture only now it is a combination of 
detail machines The special tools of the various detail workmen such as those of the beaters 
cambers  spinners  c  in  the  woollen  manufacture  are  now  transformed  into  the  tools  of 
specialised machines each machine constituting a special organ with a special function in the 
system  In  those  branches  of  industry  in  which  the  machinery  system  is  first  introduced 
Manufacture itself furnishes in a general way the natural basis for the division and consequent 

 

 

Chapter  
 
organisation  of  the  process  of  production  Nevertheless  an  essential  difference  at  once 
manifests  itself  In  Manufacture  it  is  the  workmen  who  with  their  manual  implements  must 
either  singly  or  in  groups  carry  on  each  particular  detail  process  If  on  the  one  hand  the 
workman becomes adapted to the process on the other the process was previously made suitable 
to the workman This subjective principle of the division of labour no longer exists in production 
by  machinery  Here  the  process  as  a  whole  is  examined  objectively  in  itself  that  is  to  say 
without regard to the question of its execution by human hands it is analysed into its constituent 
phases and the problem how to execute each detail process and bind them all into a whole is 
solved by the aid of machines chemistry c But of course in this case also theory must be 
perfected by accumulated experience on a large scale Each detail machine supplies raw material 
to  the  machine  next  in  order  and  since  they  are  all  working  at  the  same  time  the  product  is 
always  going  through  the  various  stages  of  its  fabrication  and  is  also  constantly  in  a  state  of 
transition from one phase to another Just as in Manufacture the direct cooperation of the detail 
labourers  establishes  a  numerical  proportion  between  the  special  groups  so  in  an  organised 
system of machinery where one detail machine is constantly kept employed by another a fixed 
relation is established between their numbers their size and their speed The collective machine 
now an organised system of various kinds of single machines and of groups of single machines 
becomes more and more perfect the more the process as a whole becomes a continuous one ie 
the less the raw material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last in other words 
the more its passage from one phase to another is effected not by the hand of man but by the 
machinery itself In Manufacture the isolation of each detail process is a condition imposed by the 
nature of division of labour but in the fully developed factory the continuity of those processes is 
on the contrary imperative  
A system of machinery whether it reposes on the mere cooperation of similar machines as in 
weaving or on a combination of different machines as in spinning constitutes in itself a huge 
automaton  whenever  it  is  driven  by  a  selfacting  prime  mover  But  although  the  factory  as  a 
whole be driven by its steamengine yet either some of the individual machines may require the 
aid of the workman for some of their movements such aid was necessary for the running in of the 
mule carriage before the invention of the selfacting mule and is still necessary in finespinning 
mills or to enable a machine to do its work certain parts of it may require to be handled by the 
workman  like  a  manual  tool  this  was  the  case  in  machinemakers  workshops  before  the 
conversion of the slide rest into a selfactor As soon as a machine executes without mans help 
all the movements requisite to elaborate the raw material needing only attendance from him we 
have an automatic system of machinery and one that is susceptible of constant improvement in 
its  details  Such  improvements  as  the  apparatus  that stops  a drawing  frame  whenever  a  sliver 
breaks  and  the  selfacting  stop  that  stops  the  powerloom  so  soon  as  the  shuttle  bobbin  is 
emptied of weft are quite modern inventions As an example both of continuity of production 
and of the carrying out of the automatic principle we may take a modern paper mill In the paper 
industry  generally  we  may  advantageously  study  in  detail  not  only  the  distinctions  between 
modes of production based on different means of production but also the connexion of the social 
conditions of production with those modes for the old German papermaking furnishes us with a 
sample of handicraft production that of Holland in the th and of France in the th century 
with a sample of manufacturing in the strict sense and that of modern England with a sample of 
automatic  fabrication  of  this  article  Besides  these  there  still  exist  in  India  and  China  two 
distinct antique Asiatic forms of the same industry  
An  organised  system  of  machines  to  which  motion  is  communicated  by  the  transmitting 
mechanism from a central automaton is the most developed form of production by machinery 

 

 

Chapter  
 
Here we have in the place of the isolated machine a mechanical monster whose body fills whole 
factories and whose demon power at first veiled under the slow and measured motions of his 
giant limbs at length breaks out into the fast and furious whirl of his countless working organs  
There  were  mules  and  steamengines  before  there  were  any  labourers  whose  exclusive 
occupation it was to make mules and steamengines just as men wore clothes before there were 
such people as tailors The inventions of Vaucanson Arkwright Watt and others were however 
practicable only because those inventors found ready to hand a considerable number of skilled 
mechanical  workmen  placed  at  their  disposal  by  the  manufacturing  period  Some  of  these 
workmen  were  independent  handicraftsman  of  various  trades  others  were  grouped  together  in 
manufactures  in  which  as  beforementioned  division  of  labour  was  strictly  carried  out  As 
inventions increased in number and the demand for the newly discovered machines grew larger 
the machinemaking industry split up more and more into numerous independent branches and 
division of labour in these manufactures was more and more developed Here then we see in 
Manufacture the immediate technical foundation of modern industry Manufacture produced the 
machinery  by  means  of  which  modern  industry  abolished  the  handicraft  and  manufacturing 
systems in those spheres of production that it first seized upon The factory system was therefore 
raised in the natural course of things on an inadequate foundation When the system attained to a 
certain  degree  of  development  it  had  to  root  up  this  readymade  foundation  which  in  the 
meantime  had  been  elaborated  on  the  old  lines  and  to  build  up  for  itself  a  basis  that  should 
correspond  to  its  methods  of  production  Just  as  the  individual  machine  retains  a  dwarfish 
character so long as it is worked by the power of man alone and just as no system of machinery 
could be properly developed before the steamengine took the place of the earlier motive powers 
animals  wind  and  even  water  so  too  modern  industry  was  crippled  in  its  complete 
development  so  long  as  its  characteristic  instrument  of  production  the  machine  owed  its 
existence to personal strength and personal skill and depended on the muscular development the 
keenness of sight and the cunning of hand with which the detail workmen in manufactures and 
the  manual  labourers  in  handicrafts  wielded  their  dwarfish  implements  Thus  apart  from  the 
dearness of the machines made in this way a circumstance that is ever present to the mind of the 
capitalist  the  expansion  of  industries  carried  on  by  means  of  machinery  and  the  invasion  by 
machinery of fresh branches of production were dependent on the growth of a class of workmen 
who owing to the almost artistic nature of their employment could increase their numbers only 
gradually and not by leaps and bounds But besides this at a certain stage of its development 
modern  industry  became  technologically  incompatible  with  the  basis  furnished  for  it  by 
handicraft  and  Manufacture  The  increasing  size  of  the  prime  movers  of  the  transmitting 
mechanism and of the machines proper the greater complication multiformity and regularity of 
the details of these machines as they more and more departed from the model of those originally 
made by manual labour and acquired a form untrammelled except by the conditions under which 
they worked the perfecting of the automatic system and the use every day more unavoidable 
of a more refractory material such as iron instead of wood  the solution of all these problems 
which sprang up by the force of circumstances everywhere met with a stumblingblock in the 
personal restrictions which even the collective labourer of Manufacture could not break through 
except to a limited extent Such machines as the modern hydraulic press the modern powerloom 
and the modern carding engine could never have been furnished by Manufacture  
A radical change in the mode of production in one sphere of industry involves a similar change in 
other  spheres  This  happens  at  first  in  such  branches  of  industry  as  are  connected  together  by 
being separate phases of a process and yet are isolated by the social division of labour in such a 
way that each of them produces an independent commodity Thus spinning by machinery made 

 

 

Chapter  
 
weaving  by  machinery  a  necessity  and  both  together  made  the  mechanical  and  chemical 
revolution  that  took  place  in  bleaching  printing  and  dyeing  imperative  So  too  on  the  other 
hand the revolution in cottonspinning called forth the invention of the gin for separating the 
seeds from the cotton fibre it was only by means of this invention that the production of cotton 
became possible on the enormous scale at present required But more especially the revolution 
in the modes of production of industry and agriculture made necessary a revolution in the general 
conditions  of  the  social  process  of  production  ie  in  the  means  of  communication  and  of 
transport In a society whose pivot to use an expression of Fourier was agriculture on a small 
scale  with  its  subsidiary  domestic  industries  and  the  urban  handicrafts  the  means  of 
communication  and transport  were  so  utterly  inadequate to  the  productive  requirements of  the 
manufacturing  period  with  its  extended  division  of  social  labour  its  concentration  of  the 
instruments of labour  and  of  the  workmen  and  its colonial  markets  that  they  became  in fact 
revolutionised In the same way the means of communication and transport handed down from 
the manufacturing period soon became unbearable trammels on modern industry with its feverish 
haste  of  production  its  enormous  extent  its  constant  flinging  of  capital  and  labour  from  one 
sphere  of  production  into  another  and  its  newlycreated  connexions  with  the  markets  of  the 
whole  world  Hence  apart  from  the  radical  changes  introduced  in  the  construction  of  sailing 
vessels the means of communication and transport became gradually adapted to the modes of 
production of mechanical industry by the creation of a system of river steamers railways ocean 
steamers and telegraphs But the huge masses of iron that had now to be forged to be welded to 
be  cut  to  be  bored  and  to  be  shaped  demanded  on  their  part  cyclopean  machines  for  the 
construction of which the methods of the manufacturing period were utterly inadequate  
Modern Industry had therefore itself to take in hand the machine its characteristic instrument of 
production and to construct machines by machines It was not till it did this that it built up for 
itself a fitting technical foundation and stood on its own feet Machinery simultaneously with the 
increasing use of it in the first decades of this century appropriated by degrees the fabrication 
of machines proper But it was only during the decade preceding  that the construction of 
railways and ocean steamers on a stupendous scale called into existence the cyclopean machines 
now employed in the construction of prime movers  
The  most  essential  condition  to  the  production  of  machines  by  machines  was  a  prime  mover 
capable  of  exerting  any  amount  of  force  and  yet  under  perfect  control  Such  a  condition  was 
already  supplied  by  the  steamengine  But  at  the  same  time  it  was  necessary  to  produce  the 
geometrically accurate straight lines planes circles cylinders cones and spheres required in the 
detail  parts  of  the  machines  This  problem  Henry  Maudsley  solved  in  the  first  decade  of  this 
century by the invention of the slide rest a tool that was soon made automatic and in a modified 
form was applied to other constructive machines besides the lathe for which it was originally 
intended This mechanical appliance replaces not some particular tool but the hand itself which 
produces a given form by holding and guiding the cutting tool along the iron or other material 
operated upon Thus it became possible to produce the forms of the individual parts of machinery 

with a degree of ease accuracy and speed that no accumulated experience of 
the hand of the most skilled workman could give  

If  we  now  fix  our  attention  on  that  portion  of  the  machinery  employed  in  the  construction  of 
machines which constitutes the operating tool we find the manual implements reappearing but 
on a cyclopean scale The operating part of the boring machine is an immense drill driven by a 
steamengine without this machine on the other hand the cylinders of large steamengines and 
of hydraulic presses could not be made The mechanical lathe is only a cyclopean reproduction of 
the ordinary footlathe the planing machine an iron carpenter that works on iron with the same 

 

 

Chapter  
 
tools that the human carpenter employs on wood the instrument that on the London wharves 
cuts the veneers is a gigantic razor the tool of the shearing machine which shears iron as easily 
as a tailors scissors cut cloth is a monster pair of scissors and the steamhammer works with an 
ordinary hammer head but of such a weight that not Thor himself could wield it These steam
hammers are an invention of Nasmyth and there is one that weighs over  tons and strikes with a 
vertical fall of  feet on an anvil weighing  tons It is mere childsplay for it to crush a block 
of granite into powder yet it is no less capable of driving with a succession of light taps a nail 
into a piece of soft wood 
The implements of labour in the form of machinery necessitate the substitution of natural forces 
for  human  force  and  the  conscious  application  of  science  instead  of  rule  of  thumb  In 
Manufacture the organisation of the social labourprocess is purely subjective it is a combination 
of detail labourers in its machinery system modern industry has a productive organism that is 
purely objective in which the labourer becomes a mere appendage to an already existing material 
condition of production In simple cooperation and even in that founded on division of labour 
the  suppression  of  the  isolated  by  the  collective  workman  still  appears  to  be  more  or  less 
accidental Machinery with a few exceptions to be mentioned later operates only by means of 
associated labour or labour in common Hence the cooperative character of the labourprocess 
is in the latter case a technical necessity dictated by the instrument of labour itself  
Section   The Value Transferred by Machinery to the Product 
We saw that the productive forces resulting from cooperation and division of labour cost capital 
nothing They are natural forces of social labour So also physical forces like steam water c 
when  appropriated  to  productive  processes  cost  nothing  But  just  as  a  man  requires  lungs  to 
breathe with so he requires something that is work of mans hand in order to consume physical 
forces productively A waterwheel is necessary to exploit the force of water and a steamengine 
to exploit the elasticity of steam Once discovered the law of the deviation of the magnetic needle 
in the field of an electric current or the law of the magnetisation of iron around which an electric 
current circulates cost never a penny But the exploitation of these laws for the purposes of 
telegraphy c necessitates a costly and extensive apparatus The tool as we have seen is not 
exterminated by the machine From being a dwarf implement of the human organism it expands 
and multiplies into the implement of a mechanism created by man Capital now sets the labourer 
to work not with a manual tool but with a machine which itself handles the tools Although 
therefore it is clear at the first glance that by incorporating both stupendous physical forces and 
the natural sciences with the process of production modern industry raises the productiveness of 
labour to an extraordinary degree it is by no means equally clear that this increased productive 
force is not on the other hand purchased by an increased expenditure of labour Machinery like 
every other component of constant capital creates no new value but yields up its own value to 
the product that it serves to beget In so far as the machine has value and in consequence parts 
with  value  to  the  product  it  forms  an  element  in  the  value  of  that  product  Instead  of  being 
cheapened the product is made dearer in proportion to the value of the machine And it is clear as 
noonday that machines and systems of  machinery the characteristic instruments of labour of 
Modern  Industry  are  incomparably  more  loaded  with  value  than  the  implements  used  in 
handicrafts and manufactures  
In the first place it must be observed that the machinery while always entering as a whole into 
the labourprocess enters into the valuebegetting process only by bits It never adds more value 
than it loses on an average by wear and tear Hence there is a great difference between the value 
of a machine and the value transferred in a given time by that machine to the product The longer 
 

 

Chapter  
 
the life of the machine in the labourprocess the greater is that difference It is true no doubt as 
we have already seen that every instrument of labour enters as a whole into the labourprocess 
and  only  piecemeal  proportionally  to its  average  daily  loss  by  wear  and  tear  into the  value
begetting process But this difference between the instrument as a whole and its daily wear and 
tear is much greater in a machine than in a tool because the machine being made from more 
durable material has a longer life because its employment being regulated by strictly scientific 
laws allows of greater economy in the wear and tear of its parts and in the materials it consumes 
and lastly because its field of production is incomparably larger than that of a tool After making 
allowance both in the case of the machine and of the tool for their average daily cost that is for 
the  value  they  transmit  to  the  product  by  their  average  daily  wear  and  tear  and  for  their 
consumption  of  auxiliary  substance  such  as  oil  coal  and  so  on  they  each  do  their  work 
gratuitously just like the forces furnished by Nature without the help of man  The greater the 
productive power of the machinery compared with that of the tool the greater is the extent of its 
gratuitous service compared with that of the tool In modern industry man succeeded for the first 
time in making the product of his past labour work on a large scale gratuitously like the forces of 
Nature 
In  treating  of  Cooperation  and  Manufacture  it  was  shown  that  certain  general  factors  of 
production such as buildings are in comparison with the scattered means of production of the 
isolated workman economised by being consumed in common and that they therefore make the 
product cheaper In a system of machinery not only is the framework of the machine consumed 
in common by its numerous operating implements but the prime mover together with a part of 
the transmitting mechanism is consumed in common by the numerous operative machines  
Given the difference between the value of the machinery and the value transferred by it in a day 
to the product the extent to which this latter value makes the product dearer depends in the first 
instance upon the size of the product so to say upon its area Mr Baynes of Blackburn in a 
lecture published in  estimates that 

each real mechanical horsepower  will drive  selfacting mule spindles 
with preparation or  throstle spindles or  looms for  inch cloth with the 
appliances for warping sizing c  

In  the  first  case  it  is  the  days  produce  of    mule  spindles  in  the  second  of    throstle 
spindles in the third of  powerlooms over which the daily cost of one horsepower and the 
wear and tear of the machinery set in motion by that power are spread so that only a very minute 
value is transferred by such wear and tear to a pound of yarn or a yard of cloth The same is the 
case  with  the  steamhammer  mentioned  above  Since  its  daily  wear  and  tear  its  coal
consumption c are spread over the stupendous masses of iron hammered by it in a day only a 
small  value  is  added  to  a  hundred  weight  of  iron  but  that  value  would  be  very  great  if  the 
cyclopean instrument were employed in driving in nails  
Given a machines capacity for work that is the number of its operating tools or where it is a 
question of force their mass the amount of its product will depend on the velocity of its working 
parts on the speed for instance of the spindles or on the number of blows given by the hammer 
in a minute Many of these colossal hammers strike seventy times in a minute and Ryders patent 
machine for forging spindles with small hammers gives as many as  strokes per minute  
Given  the  rate  at  which  machinery  transfers  its  value  to  the  product  the  amount  of  value  so 
transferred depends on the  total  value  of  the  machinery  The  less  labour  it contains  the less 
value it imparts to the product The less value it gives up so much the more productive it is and 
so  much  the  more  its  services  approximate  to  those  of  natural  forces  But  the  production  of 
machinery by machinery lessens its value relatively to its extension and efficacy  
 

 

Chapter  
 
An  analysis  and  comparison  of  the  prices  of  commodities  produced  by  handicrafts  or 
manufactures  and  of  the  prices  of  the  same  commodities  produced  by  machinery  shows 
generally that in the product of machinery the value due to the instruments of labour increases 
relatively but decreases absolutely In other words its absolute amount decreases but its amount 
relatively to the total value of the product of a pound of yarn for instance increases  
It  is  evident  that  whenever  it  costs  as  much  labour  to  produce  a  machine  as  is  saved  by  the 
employment of that machine there is nothing but a transposition of labour consequently the total 
labour required to produce a commodity is not lessened or the productiveness of labour is not 
increased It is clear however that the difference between the labour a machine costs and the 
labour  it  saves  in  other  words  that  the  degree  of  its  productiveness  does  not  depend  on  the 
difference between its own value and the value of the implement it replaces As long as the labour 
spent  on  a  machine  and  consequently  the  portion  of  its  value  added  to  the  product  remains 
smaller  than  the  value  added  by  the  workman  to  the  product  with  his  tool  there  is  always  a 
difference of labour saved in favour of the machine The productiveness of a machine is therefore 
measured  by  the  human  labourpower  it  replaces  According  to  Mr  Baynes    operatives  are 
required for the  mule spindles inclusive of preparation machinery that are driven by one
horse  power  each  selfacting  mule  spindle  working  ten  hours  produces    ounces  of  yarn 
average  number  of  thickness  consequently    operatives  spin  weekly      lbs  of  yarn 
Hence leaving waste on one side  lbs of cotton absorb during their conversion into yarn 
only    hours  labour  or  fifteen  days  labour  of  ten  hours  each  But  with  a  spinningwheel 
supposing the handspinner to produce thirteen ounces of yarn in sixty hours the same weight of 
cotton  would  absorb    days  labour  of  ten  hours  each  or    hours  labour  Where 
blockprinting  the  old  method  of  printing  calico  by  hand  has  been  superseded  by  machine 
printing a single machine prints with the aid of one man or boy as much calico of four colours 
in one hour as it formerly took  men to do Before Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 
 the separation of the seed from a pound of cotton cost an average days labour By means 
of his invention one negress was enabled to clean  lbs daily and since then the efficacy of 
the gin has been considerably increased A pound of cotton wool previously costing  cents to 
produce  included  after  that  invention  more  unpaid  labour  and  was  consequently  sold  with 
greater  profit  at    cents  In  India  they  employ  for  separating  the  wool  from  the  seed  an 
instrument half machine half tool called a churka with this one man and a woman can clean  
lbs daily With the churka invented some years ago by Dr Forbes one man and a boy produce 
 lbs daily If oxen steam or water be used for driving it only a few boys and girls as feeders 
are required Sixteen of these machines driven by oxen do as much work in a day as formerly  
people did on an average  
As already stated a steamplough does as much work in one hour at a cost of threepence as  
men at a cost of  shillings I return to this example in order to clear up an erroneous notion The 
 shillings are by no means the expression in money of all the labour expended in one hour by 
the  men If the ratio of surplus labour to necessary labour were  these  men would 
produce in one hour a value of  shillings although their wages  shillings represent only 
their labour for half an hour Suppose then a machine cost as much as the wages for a year of the 
  men  it  displaces  say   this    is  by  no  means  the  expression  in  money  of  the 
labour added to the object produced by these  men before the introduction of the machine but 
only of that portion of their years labour which was expended for themselves and represented by 
their wages On the other hand the  the moneyvalue of the machine expresses all the 
labour expended on its production no matter in what proportion this labour constitutes wages for 
the workman and surplusvalue for the capitalist Therefore though a machine cost as much as 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the labourpower displaced by it costs yet the labour materialised in it is even then much less 
than the living labour it replaces  
The use of machinery for the exclusive purpose of cheapening the product is limited in this way 
that  less  labour  must  be  expended  in  producing  the  machinery  than  is  displaced  by  the 
employment of that machinery For the capitalist however this use is still more limited Instead 
of  paying  for the labour he  only  pays  the  value of the labourpower  employed therefore  the 
limit to his using a machine is fixed by the difference between the value of the machine and the 
value of the labourpower replaced by it Since the division of the days work into necessary and 
surplus labour differs in different countries and even in the same country at different periods or 
in different branches of industry and further since the actual wage of the labourer at one time 
sinks  below  the  value  of  his  labourpower  at  another  rises  above  it  it  is  possible  for  the 
difference between the price of the machinery and the price of the labourpower replaced by that 
machinery to vary very much although the difference between the quantity of labour requisite to 
produce the machine and the total quantity replaced by it remain constant But it is the former 
difference  alone  that  determines  the  cost  to  the  capitalist  of  producing  a  commodity  and 
through  the  pressure  of  competition  influences  his  action  Hence  the invention  nowadays  of 
machines  in  England  that  are  employed  only  in  North  America  just  as  in  the  sixteenth  and 
seventeenth centuries machines were invented in Germany to be used only in Holland and just 
as many a French invention of the eighteenth century was exploited in England alone In the older 
countries machinery when employed in some branches of industry creates such a redundancy of 
labour in other branches that in these latter the fall of wages below the value of labourpower 
impedes the use of machinery and from the standpoint of the capitalist whose profit comes not 
from a diminution of the labour employed but of the labour paid for renders that use superfluous 
and often impossible In some branches of the woollen manufacture in England the employment 
of children has during recent years been considerably diminished and in some cases has been 
entirely  abolished  Why  Because  the  Factory  Acts  made  two  sets  of  children  necessary  one 
working six hours the other four or each working five hours But the parents refused to sell the 
halftimers cheaper than the fulltimers Hence the substitution of machinery for the half
timers Before the labour of women and of children under  years of age was forbidden in 
mines capitalists considered the employment of naked women and girls often in company with 
men so far sanctioned by their moral code and especially by their ledgers that it was only after 
the passing of the Act that they had recourse to machinery The Yankees have invented a stone
breaking machine The English do not make use of it because the wretch who does this work 
gets  paid  for  such  a  small  portion  of  his  labour  that  machinery  would  increase  the  cost  of 
production to the capitalist In England women are still occasionally used instead of horses for 
hauling  canal  boats  because  the  labour  required  to  produce  horses  and  machines  is  an 
accurately known quantity while that required to maintain the women of the surpluspopulation 
is  below  all  calculation  Hence  nowhere  do  we  find  a  more  shameful  squandering  of  human 
labourpower for the most despicable purposes than in England the land of machinery  

Section   The Proximate Effects of Machinery on the 

Workman 

The startingpoint of modern industry is as we have shown the revolution in the instruments of 
labour  and  this  revolution  attains  its  most  highly  developed  form  in  the  organised  system  of 
machinery in a factory Before we inquire how human material is incorporated with this objective 
organism let us consider some general effects of this revolution on the labourer himself 

 

 

 

Chapter  

A Appropriation of Supplementary LabourPower by 
Capital The Employment of Women and Children 

In  so  far  as  machinery  dispenses  with  muscular  power  it  becomes  a  means  of  employing 
labourers  of  slight  muscular  strength  and  those  whose  bodily  development  is  incomplete  but 
whose limbs are all the more supple The labour of women and children was therefore the first 
thing  sought  for  by  capitalists  who  used  machinery  That  mighty  substitute  for  labour  and 
labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number of wagelabourers by 
enrolling  under  the  direct  sway  of  capital  every  member  of  the  workmans  family  without 
distinction of age or sex Compulsory work for the capitalist usurped the place not only of the 
childrens  play  but  also  of  free  labour  at  home  within  moderate  limits  for  the  support  of  the 
family  
The value of labourpower was determined not only by the labourtime necessary to maintain the 
individual  adult  labourer  but  also  by  that  necessary  to  maintain  his  family  Machinery  by 
throwing every member of that family on to the labourmarket spreads the value of the mans 
labourpower over his whole family It thus depreciates his labourpower To purchase the labour
power of a family of four workers may perhaps cost more than it formerly did to purchase the 
labourpower of the head of the family but in return four days labour takes the place of one 
and  their  price  falls  in  proportion  to  the  excess  of  the  surplus  labour  of  four  over  the  surplus 
labour  of  one  In  order  that  the  family  may  live  four  people  must  now  not  only  labour  but 
expend  surplus  labour  for  the  capitalist  Thus  we  see  that  machinery  while  augmenting  the 
human material that forms the principal object of capitals exploiting power at the same time 
raises the degree of exploitation  
Machinery also revolutionises out and out the contract between the labourer and the capitalist 
which formally fixes their mutual relations Taking the exchange of commodities as our basis our 
first assumption was that capitalist and labourer met as free persons as independent owners of 
commodities the one possessing money and means of production the other labourpower But 
now the capitalist buys children and young persons under age Previously the workman sold his 
own labourpower which he disposed of nominally as a free agent Now he sells wife and child 
He has become a slavedealer The demand for childrens labour often resembles in form the 
inquiries  for  negro  slaves  such  as  were  formerly  to  be  read  among  the  advertisements  in 
American journals 

My attention says an English factory inspector was drawn to an advertisement 
in the local paper of one of the most important manufacturing towns of my 
district of which the following is a copy Wanted  to  young persons not 
younger than what can pass for  years Wages  shillings a week Apply c  

The  phrase  what  can  pass  for    years  has  reference  to  the  fact  that  by  the  Factory  Act 
children under  years may work only  hours A surgeon officially appointed must certify their 
age The manufacturer therefore asks for children who look as if they were already  years old 
The decrease often by leaps and bounds in the number of children under  years employed in 
factories a decrease that is shown in an astonishing manner by the English statistics of the last  
years was for the most part according to the evidence of the factory inspectors themselves the 
work  of  the  certifying  surgeons  who  overstated  the  age  of  the  children  agreeably  to  the 
capitalists greed for exploitation and the sordid trafficking needs of the parents In the notorious 
district of Bethnal Green a public market is held every Monday and Tuesday morning where 
children of both sexes from  years of age upwards hire themselves out to the silk manufacturers 
The usual terms are s d a week this belongs to the parents and d for myself and tea The 

 

 

Chapter  
 
contract is binding only for the week The scene and language while this market is going on are 
quite disgraceful   It has also occurred in England that women have taken children from the 
workhouse and let any one have them out for s d a week In spite of legislation the number 
of boys sold in Great Britain by their parents to act as live chimneysweeping machines although 
there  exist  plenty  of  machines  to  replace  them  exceeds    The  revolution  effected  by 
machinery in the juridical relations between the buyer and the seller of labourpower causing the 
transaction as a whole to lose the appearance of a contract between free persons afforded the 
English  Parliament  an  excuse  founded  on juridical principles  for  the interference  of the  state 
with factories Whenever the law limits the labour of children to  hours in industries not before 
interfered  with  the  complaints  of  the  manufacturers  are  always  renewed  They  allege  that 
numbers of the parents withdraw their children from the industry brought under the Act in order 
to  sell  them  where  freedom  of  labour  still  rules  ie  where  children  under    years  are 
compelled to work like grownup people and therefore can be got rid of at a higher price But 
since capital is by nature a leveller since it exacts in every sphere of production equality in the 
conditions of the exploitation of labour the limitation by law of childrens labour in one branch 
of industry becomes the cause of its limitation in others  
We have already alluded to the physical deterioration as well of the children and youngpersons 
as of the women whom machinery first directly in the factories that shoot up on its basis and 
then indirectly in all the remaining branches of industry subjects to the exploitation of capital In 
this place therefore we dwell only on one point the enormous mortality during the first few 
years of their life of the children of the operatives  In sixteen of the registration districts into 
which England is divided there are for every  children alive under the age of one year 
only  deaths in a year on an average in one district only  in  districts the deaths are 
over  but under  in  districts over  but under  in  districts over 
  but  under    in    districts  over    in    districts  over    in    over 
  in    over    in  Hoo  Wolverhampton  AshtonunderLyne  and  Preston  over 
  in  Nottingham  Stockport  and  Bradford  over    in  Wisbeach    and  in 
Manchester  As was shown by an official medical inquiry in the year  the high 
deathrates are apart from local causes principally due to the employment of the mothers away 
from  their  homes  and  to  the  neglect  and  maltreatment  consequent  on  her  absence  such  as 
amongst others insufficient nourishment unsuitable food and dosing with opiates besides this 
there  arises  an  unnatural  estrangement  between  mother  and  child  and  as  a  consequence 
intentional  starving  and  poisoning  of  the  children  In  those  agricultural  districts  where  a 
minimum in the employment of women exists the deathrate is on the other hand very low   
The  Inquiry  Commission  of    led  however  to  the  unexpected  result  that  in  some  purely 
agricultural districts bordering on the North Sea the deathrate of children under one year old 
almost equalled that of the worst factory districts Dr Julian Hunter was therefore commissioned 
to investigate this phenomenon on the spot His report is incorporated with the Sixth Report on 
Public Health Up to that time it was supposed that the children were decimated by malaria 
and other diseases peculiar to lowlying and marshy districts But the inquiry showed the very 
opposite namely that the same cause which drove away malaria the conversion of the land from 
a morass in winter and a scanty pasture in summer into fruitful corn land created the exceptional 
deathrate of the infants The  medical men whom Dr Hunter examined in that district were 
wonderfully in accord on this point In fact the revolution in the mode of cultivation had led to 
the introduction of the industrial system  
Married  women  who  work  in  gangs  along  with  boys  and  girls  are  for  a  stipulated  sum  of 
money placed at the disposal of the farmer by a man called the undertaker who contracts for 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the whole gang These gangs will sometimes travel many miles from their own village they are 
to be met morning and evening on the roads dressed in short petticoats with suitable coats and 
boots  and  sometimes  trousers  looking  wonderfully  strong  and  healthy  but  tainted  with  a 
customary  immorality  and  heedless  of  the  fatal  results  which  their  love  of  this  busy  and 
independent life is bringing on their unfortunate offspring who are pining at home 
Every phenomenon of the factory districts is here reproduced including but to a greater extent 
illdisguised infanticide and dosing children with opiates  

My knowledge of such evils says Dr Simon the medical officer of the Privy 
Council and editor in chief of the Reports on Public Health may excuse the 
profound misgiving with which I regard any large industrial employment of adult 
women  

Happy indeed exclaims Mr Baker the factory inspector in his official report happy indeed 
will it be for the manufacturing districts of England when every married woman having a family 
is prohibited from working in any textile works at all 
The moral degradation caused by the capitalistic exploitation of women and children has been so 
exhaustively  depicted  by  F  Engels  in  his  Lage  der  Arbeitenden Klasse  Englands  and  other 
writers  that  I  need  only  mention  the  subject  in  this  place  But  the  intellectual  desolation 
artificially  produced  by  converting  immature  human  beings  into  mere  machines  for  the 
fabrication of surplusvalue a state of mind clearly distinguishable from that natural ignorance 
which keeps the mind fallow without destroying its capacity for development its natural fertility 
this  desolation  finally  compelled  even  the  English  Parliament  to  make  elementary  education a 
compulsory  condition  to  the  productive  employment  of  children  under    years  in  every 
industry subject to the Factory Acts The spirit of capitalist production stands out clearly in the 
ludicrous wording of the socalled education clauses in the Factory Acts in the absence of an 
administrative machinery an absence that again makes the compulsion illusory in the opposition 
of the manufacturers themselves to these education clauses and in the tricks and dodges they put 
in practice for evading them 

For this the legislature is alone to blame by having passed a delusive law which 
while it would seem to provide that the children employed in factories shall be 
educated contains no enactment by which that professed end can be secured It 
provides nothing more than that the children shall on certain days of the week and 
for a certain number of hours three in each day be inclosed within the four walls 
of a place called a school and that the employer of the child shall receive weekly 
a certificate to that effect signed by a person designated by the subscriber as a 
schoolmaster or schoolmistress  

Previous to the passing of the amended Factory Act  it happened not unfrequently that the 
certificates  of  attendance  at  school  were  signed  by  the  schoolmaster  or  schoolmistress  with  a 
cross as they themselves were unable to write 

On one occasion on visiting a place called a school from which certificates of 
school attendance had issued I was so struck with the ignorance of the master 
that I said to him Pray sir can you read His reply was Aye summat and as 
a justification of his right to grant certificates he added At any rate I am before 
my scholars  

The inspectors when the Bill of  was in preparation did not fail to represent the disgraceful 
state  of  the  places  called  schools  certificates  from  which  they  were  obliged  to  admit  as  a 

 

Chapter  
 
compliance with the laws but they were successful only in obtaining thus much that since the 
passing of the Act of   

 

the figures in the school certificate must be filled up in the handwriting of the 
schoolmaster who must also sign his Christian and surname in full 

Sir John Kincaid factory inspector for Scotland relates experiences of the same kind 
The first school we visited was kept by a Mrs Ann Killin Upon asking her to 
spell her name she straightway made a mistake by beginning with the letter C 
but correcting herself immediately she said her name began with a K On looking 
at her signature however in the school certificate books I noticed that she spelt it 
in various ways while her handwriting left no doubt as to her unfitness to teach 
She herself also acknowledged that she could not keep the register  In a second 
school I found the schoolroom  feet long and  feet wide and counted in this 
space  children who were gabbling something unintelligible But it is not 
only in the miserable places above referred to that the children obtain certificates 
of school attendance without having received instruction of any value for in many 
schools where there is a competent teacher his efforts are of little avail from the 
distracting crowd of children of all ages from infants of  years old and upwards 
his livelihood miserable at the best depending on the pence received from the 
greatest number of children whom it is possible to cram into the space To this is 
to be added scanty school furniture deficiency of books and other materials for 
teaching and the depressing effect upon the poor children themselves of a close 
noisome atmosphere I have been in many such schools where I have seen rows 
of children doing absolutely nothing and this is certified as school attendance 
and in statistical returns such children are set down as being educated 

In Scotland the manufacturers try all they can to do without the children that are obliged to attend 
school 

It requires no further argument to prove that the educational clauses of the 
Factory Act being held in such disfavour among millowners tend in a great 
measure to exclude that class of children alike from the employment and the 
benefit of education contemplated by this Act 

Horribly grotesque does this appear in print works which are regulated by a special Act By that 
Act 

every child before being employed in a print work must have attended school for 
at least  days and not less than  hours during the six months immediately 
preceding such first day of employment and during the continuance of its 
employment in the print works it must attend for a like period of  days and  
hours during every successive period of six months The attendance at school 
must be between  am and  pm No attendance of less than  hours nor more 
than  hours on any one day shall be reckoned as part of the  hours Under 
ordinary circumstances the children attend school morning and afternoon for  
days for at least  hours each day and upon the expiration of the  days the 
statutory total of  hours having been attained having in their language made 
up their book they return to the print work where they continue until the six 
months have expired when another instalment of school attendance becomes due 
and they again seek the school until the book is again made up Many boys 
having attended school for the required number of hours when they return to 

 

 

 

Chapter  

school after the expiration of their six months work in the print work are in the 
same condition as when they first attended school as printwork boys that they 
have lost all they gained by their previous school attendance In other print 
works the childrens attendance at school is made to depend altogether upon the 
exigencies of the work in the establishment The requisite number of hours is 
made up each six months by instalments consisting of from  to  hours at a time 
spreading over perhaps the whole six months For instance the attendance on 
one day might be from  to  am on another day from  pm to  pm and the 
child might not appear at school again for several days when it would attend from 
 pm to  pm then it might attend for  or  days consecutively or for a week 
then it would not appear in school for  weeks or a month after that upon some 
odd days at some odd hours when the operative who employed it chose to spare it 
and thus the child was as it were buffeted from school to work from work to 
school until the tale of  hours was told  

By the excessive addition of women and children to the ranks of the workers machinery at last 
breaks down the resistance which the male operatives in the manufacturing period continued to 
oppose to the despotism of capital  

B Prolongation of the Working day 

If machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of labour  ie for 
shortening the workingtime required in the production of a commodity it becomes in the hands 
of capital the most powerful means in those industries first invaded by it for lengthening the 
working day beyond all bounds set by human nature It creates on the one hand new conditions 
by which capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency and on the other hand 
new motives with which to whet capitals appetite for the labour of others  
In the first place in the form of machinery the implements of labour become automatic things 
moving and working independent of the workman They are thenceforth an industrial perpetuum 
mobile that would go on producing forever did it not meet with certain natural obstructions in 
the  weak  bodies  and  the  strong  wills  of  its  human  attendants  The  automaton  as  capital  and 
because it is capital is endowed in the person of the capitalist with intelligence and will it is 
therefore animated by the longing to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by that repellent 
yet elastic natural barrier man This resistance is moreover lessened by the apparent lightness 
of  machine  work  and  by  the  more  pliant  and  docile  character  of  the  women  and  children 
employed on it  
The productiveness of machinery is as we saw inversely proportional to the value transferred by 
it to the product The longer the life of the machine the greater is the mass of the products over 
which the value transmitted by the machine is spread and the less is the portion of that value 
added to each single commodity The active lifetime of a machine is however clearly dependent 
on the length of the working day or on the duration of the daily labourprocess multiplied by the 
number of days for which the process is carried on  
The wear and tear of a machine is not exactly proportional to its workingtime And even if it 
were so a machine working  hours daily for  years covers as long a working period as and 
transmits to the total product no more value than the same machine would if it worked only  
hours daily for  years But in the first case the value of the machine would be reproduced twice 
as quickly as in the latter and the capitalist would by this use of the machine absorb in  years 
as much surplusvalue as in the second case he would in   

 

 

Chapter  
 
The material wear and tear of a machine is of two kinds The one arises from use as coins wear 
away by circulating the other from nonuse as a sword rusts when left in its scabbard The latter 
kind is due to the elements The former is more or less directly proportional the latter to a certain 
extent inversely proportional to the use of the machine  
But in addition to the material wear and tear a machine also undergoes what we may call a moral 
depreciation  It  loses  exchangevalue  either  by  machines  of  the  same  sort  being  produced 
cheaper than it or by better machines entering into competition with it In both cases be the 
machine ever so young and full of life its value is no longer determined by the labour actually 
materialised in it but by the labourtime requisite to reproduce either it or the better machine It 
has therefore lost value more or less The shorter the period taken to reproduce its total value 
the less is the danger of moral depreciation and the longer the working day the shorter is that 
period When machinery is first introduced into an industry new methods of reproducing it more 
cheaply follow blow upon blow and so do improvements that not only affect individual parts 
and details of the machine but its entire build It is therefore in the early days of the life of 
machinery that this special incentive to the prolongation of the working day makes itself felt most 
acutely  
Given the length of the working day all other circumstances remaining the same the exploitation 
of double the number of workmen demands not only a doubling of that part of constant capital 
which  is  invested  in  machinery  and  buildings  but  also  of  that  part  which  is  laid  out  in  raw 
material and auxiliary substances The lengthening of the working day on the other hand allows 
of production on an extended scale without any alteration in the amount of capital laid out on 
machinery  and  buildings  Not  only  is  there  therefore  an  increase  of  surplusvalue  but  the 
outlay necessary to obtain it diminishes It is true that this takes place more or less with every 
lengthening of the working day but in the case under consideration the change is more marked 
because the capital converted into the instruments of labour preponderates to a greater degree  
The development of the factory system fixes a constantly increasing portion of the capital in a 
form in which on the one hand its value is capable of continual selfexpansion and in which on 
the other hand it loses both usevalue and exchangevalue whenever it loses contact with living 
labour When a labourer said Mr Ashworth a cotton magnate to Professor Nassau W Senior 
lays down his spade he renders useless for that period a capital worth eighteenpence When 
one of our people leaves the mill he renders useless a capital that has cost  Only 
fancy  making  useless  for  a  single  moment  a  capital  that  has  cost    It  is  in  truth 
monstrous that a single one of our people should ever leave the factory The increased use of 
machinery as Senior after the instruction he received from Ashworth clearly perceives makes a 
constantly increasing lengthening of the working day desirable  
Machinery produces relative surplusvalue not only by directly depreciating the value of labour
power and by indirectly cheapening the same through cheapening the commodities that enter into 
its reproduction but also when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry by converting 
the labour employed by the owner of that machinery into labour of a higher degree and greater 
efficacy by raising the social value of the article produced above its individual value and thus 
enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a days labourpower by a smaller portion of the 
value of a days product During this transition period when the use of machinery is a sort of 
monopoly  the  profits  are  therefore  exceptional  and  the  capitalist  endeavours  to  exploit 
thoroughly  the  sunny  time  of  this  his  first love  by  prolonging  the  working  day  as  much  as 
possible The magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit  
As the use of machinery becomes more general in a particular industry the social value of the 
product sinks down to its individual value and the law that surplusvalue does not arise from the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labourpower  that  has  been  replaced  by  the  machinery  but  from  the  labourpower  actually 
employed in working with the machinery asserts itself Surplusvalue arises from variable capital 
alone  and  we  saw  that  the  amount  of  surplusvalue  depends  on  two  factors  viz  the  rate  of 
surplusvalue and the number of the workmen simultaneously employed Given the length of the 
working  day  the  rate  of  surplusvalue  is  determined  by  the  relative  duration  of  the  necessary 
labour and of the surplus labour in a day The number of the labourers simultaneously employed 
depends on its side on the ratio of the variable to the constant capital Now however much the 
use  of  machinery  may  increase  the  surplus  labour  at  the  expense  of  the  necessary  labour  by 
heightening the productiveness of labour it is clear that it attains this result only by diminishing 
the number of workmen employed by a given amount of capital It converts what was formerly 
variable capital invested in labourpower into machinery which being constant capital does not 
produce surplusvalue It is impossible for instance to squeeze as much surplusvalue out of  as 
out of  labourers If each of these  men gives only one hour of surplus labour in  the  
men give together  hours of surplus labour while  hours is the total labour of the two men 
Hence the application of machinery to the production of surplusvalue implies a contradiction 
which is immanent in it since of the two factors of the surplusvalue created by a given amount 
of capital one the rate of surplusvalue cannot be increased except by diminishing the other the 
number of workmen This contradiction comes to light as soon as by the general employment of 
machinery in a given industry the value of the machineproduced commodity regulates the value 
of  all  commodities  of  the  same  sort  and  it  is  this  contradiction  that  in  its  turn  drives  the 
capitalist without his being conscious of the fact to excessive lengthening of the working day 
in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of labourers exploited by an 
increase not only of the relative but of the absolute surplus labour  
If then the capitalistic employment of machinery on the one hand supplies new and powerful 
motives  to  an  excessive  lengthening  of  the  working  day  and  radically  changes  as  well  the 
methods of labour as also the character of the social working organism in such a manner as to 
break down all opposition to this tendency on the other hand it produces partly by opening out to 
the capitalist new strata of the workingclass previously inaccessible to him partly by setting free 
the labourers it supplants a surplus working population which is compelled to submit to the 
dictation of capital Hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of modern industry that 
machinery  sweeps away  every  moral and natural restriction  on  the length of the  working  day 
Hence too the economic paradox that the most powerful instrument for shortening labourtime 
becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourers time and that of his 
family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital If 
dreamed Aristotle the greatest thinker of antiquity if every tool when summoned or even of its 
own  accord  could  do  the  work  that  befits  it  just  as  the  creations  of  Daedalus  moved  of 
themselves or the tripods of Hephaestos went of their own accord to their sacred work if the 
weavers shuttles were to weave of themselves then there would be no need either of apprentices 
for the master workers or of slaves for the lords  And Antipatros a Greek poet of the time of 
Cicero  hailed  the  invention  of  the  waterwheel  for  grinding  corn  an  invention  that  is  the 
elementary form of all machinery as the giver of freedom to female slaves and the bringer back 
of the golden age Oh those heathens They understood as the learned Bastiat and before him 
the still wiser MacCulloch have discovered nothing of Political Economy and Christianity They 
did not for example comprehend that machinery is the surest means of lengthening the working 
day  They  perhaps  excused  the  slavery  of  one  on  the  ground  that  it  was  a  means  to  the  full 
development of another But to preach slavery of the masses in order that a few crude and half
educated  parvenus  might  become  eminent  spinners  extensive  sausagemakers  and 
influential shoeblack dealers to do this they lacked the bump of Christianity

C Intensification of Labour 

The immoderate lengthening of the working day produced by machinery in the hands of capital 
leads to a reaction on the part of society the very sources of whose life are menaced and thence 
to a normal working day whose length is fixed by law Thenceforth a phenomenon that we have 
already  met  with  namely  the  intensification  of  labour  develops  into  great  importance  Our 
analysis  of  absolute  surplusvalue  had  reference  primarily  to  the  extension  or  duration  of  the 
labour its intensity being assumed as given We now proceed to consider the substitution of a 
more intensified labour for labour of more extensive duration and the degree of the former  
It  is  selfevident  that  in  proportion  as  the  use  of  machinery  spreads  and  the  experience  of  a 
special  class  of  workmen  habituated  to  machinery  accumulates  the  rapidity  and  intensity  of 
labour increase as a natural consequence Thus in England during half a century lengthening of 
the working day went hand in hand with increasing intensity of factory labour Nevertheless the 
reader will clearly see that where we have labour not carried on by fits and starts but repeated 
day after day with unvarying uniformity a point must inevitably be reached where extension of 
the  working  day  and  intensity  of the  labour  mutually  exclude  one  another  in  such  a  way  that 
lengthening of the working day becomes compatible only with a lower degree of intensity and a 
higher degree of intensity only with a shortening of the working day So soon as the gradually 
surging revolt of the workingclass compelled Parliament to shorten compulsorily the hours of 
labour and to begin by imposing a normal working day on factories proper so soon consequently 
as an increased production of surplusvalue by the prolongation of the working day was once for 
all put a stop to from that moment capital threw itself with all its might into the production of 
relative surplusvalue by hastening on the further improvement of machinery At the same time a 
change  took  place  in  the  nature  of  relative  surplusvalue  Generally  speaking  the  mode  of 
producing relative surplusvalue consists in raising the productive power of the workman so as to 
enable him to produce more in a given time with the same expenditure of labour Labourtime 
continues to transmit as before the same value to the total product but this unchanged amount of 
exchangevalue is spread over more usevalue hence the value of each single commodity sinks 
Otherwise however so soon as the compulsory shortening of the hours of labour takes place The 
immense impetus it gives the development of productive power and to economy in the means of 
production imposes on the workman increased expenditure of labour in a given time heightened 
tension of labourpower and closer filling up of the pores of the working day or condensation of 
labour to a  degree that  is attainable  only  within  the limits  of  the shortened  working  day  This 
condensation of a greater mass of labour into a given period thenceforward counts for what it 
really  is  a  greater  quantity  of  labour  In  addition  to  a  measure  of  its  extension  ie  duration 
labour now acquires a measure of its intensity or of the degree of its condensation or density 
The denser hour of the ten hours working day contains more labour ie expended labourpower 
than the more porous hour of the twelve hours working day The product therefore of one of the 
former hours has as much or more value than has the product of   of the latter hours Apart 
from  the  increased  yield  of  relative  surplusvalue  through  the  heightened  productiveness  of 
labour the same mass of value is now produced for the capitalist say by   hours of surplus 
labour and   hours of necessary labour as was previously produced by four hours of surplus 
labour and eight hours of necessary labour  
We now come to the question How is the labour intensified  
The first effect of shortening the working day results from the selfevident law that the efficiency 
of labourpower is in an inverse ratio to the duration of its expenditure Hence within certain 
limits what is lost by shortening the duration is gained by the increasing tension of labourpower 
That the workman moreover really does expend more labourpower is ensured by the mode in 
 

 

Chapter  
 
which the capitalist pays him In those industries such as potteries where machinery plays little 
or no part the introduction of the Factory Acts has strikingly shown that the mere shortening of 
the working day increases to a wonderful degree the regularity uniformity order continuity and 
energy  of  the  labour  It  seemed  however  doubtful  whether  this  effect  was  produced  in  the 
factory proper where the dependence of the workman on the continuous and uniform motion of 
the machinery had already created the strictest discipline Hence when in  the reduction of 
the working day to less than twelve hours was being debated the masters almost unanimously 
declared 

that their overlookers in the different rooms took good care that the hands lost no 
time that the extent of vigilance and attention on the part of the workmen was 
hardly capable of being increased and therefore that the speed of the machinery 
and other conditions remaining unaltered to expect in a wellmanaged factory 
any important result from increased attention of the workmen was an absurdity 

This assertion was contradicted by experiments Mr Robert Gardner reduced the hours of labour 
in his two large factories at Preston on and after the th April  from twelve to eleven 
hours a day The result of about a years working was that the same amount of product for the 
same cost was received and the workpeople as a whole earned in eleven hours as much wages as 
they did before in twelve I pass over the experiments made in the spinning and carding rooms 
because they were accompanied by an increase of  in the speed of the machines But in the 
weaving department where moreover many sorts of figured fancy articles were woven there 
was not the slightest alteration in the conditions of the work The result was From th January 
to th April  with a twelve hours day average weekly wages of each hand s d 
from th April to th June  with day of eleven hours average weekly wages s d 
Here  we  have  more  produced  in  eleven  hours  than  previously  in  twelve  and  entirely  in 
consequence of more steady application and economy of time by the workpeople While they got 
the same wages and gained one hour of spare time the capitalist got the same amount produced 
and saved the cost of coal gas and other such items for one hour Similar experiments and with 
the like success were carried out in the mills of Messrs Horrocks and Jacson 
The  shortening  of  the  hours  of  labour  creates  to  begin  with  the  subjective  conditions  for  the 
condensation of labour by enabling the workman to exert more strength in a given time So soon 
as that shortening becomes compulsory machinery becomes in the hands of capital the objective 
means systematically employed for squeezing out more labour in a given time This is effected in 
two ways by increasing the speed of the machinery and by giving the workman more machinery 
to tent Improved construction of the machinery is necessary partly because without it greater 
pressure cannot be put on the workman and partly because the shortened hours of labour force 
the capitalist to exercise the strictest watch over the cost of production The improvements in the 
steamengine have increased the piston speed and at the same time have made it possible by 
means of a greater economy of power to drive with the same or even a smaller consumption of 
coal  more  machinery  with  the same  engine The improvements  in the transmitting  mechanism 
have lessened friction and what so strikingly distinguishes modern from the older machinery 
have  reduced  the  diameter  and  weight  of  the  shafting  to  a  constantly  decreasing  minimum 
Finally the improvements in the operative machines have while reducing their size increased 
their speed and efficiency as in the modern powerloom or while increasing the size of their 
framework  have  also  increased  the  extent  and  number  of  their  working  parts  as  in  spinning
mules or have added to the speed of these working parts by imperceptible alterations of detail 
such as those which ten years ago increased the speed of the spindles in selfacting mules by one
fifth  

 

Chapter  
 
The  reduction  of  the  working  day  to    hours  dates  in  England  from    In    a 
manufacturer stated 

 

The labour now undergone in the factories is much greater than it used to be  
compared with thirty or forty years ago  owing to the greater attention and 
activity required by the greatly increased speed which is given to the 
machinery 

In  the  year    Lord  Ashley  now  Lord  Shaftesbury  made  in  the  House  of  Commons  the 
following statements supported by documentary evidence 

The labour performed by those engaged in the processes of manufacture is three 
times as great as in the beginning of such operations Machinery has executed no 
doubt the work that would demand the sinews of millions of men but it has also 
prodigiously multiplied the labour of those who are governed by its fearful 
movements In  the labour of following a pair of mules spinning cotton of 
No   reckoning  hours to the working day  involved a necessity of walking 
 miles In  the distance travelled in following a pair of mules spinning 
cotton yarn of the same number was  miles and frequently more In  
query   or  the spinner put up daily on each of these mules  
stretches making a total of  stretches in the course of the day In  the 
spinner put up on each mule  stretches making a total of  In  
 stretches making a total of  and in some cases the amount of labour 
required is even still greater I have another document sent to me in  
stating that the labour is progressively increasing  increasing not only because the 
distance to be travelled is greater but because the quantity of goods produced is 
multiplied while the hands are fewer in proportion than before and moreover 
because an inferior species of cotton is now often spun which it is more difficult 
to work In the cardingroom there has also been a great increase of labour One 
person there does the work formerly divided between two In the weavingroom 
where a vast number of persons are employed and principally females  the 
labour has increased within the last few years fully  per cent owing to the 
increased speed of the machinery in spinning In  the number of hanks spun 
per week was  in  it amounted to  In  the number of picks 
in powerloomweaving per minute was   in  it was  showing a vast 
increase of labour  

In the face of this remarkable intensity of labour which had already been reached in  under 
the Twelve Hours Act there appeared to be a justification for the assertion made at that time by 
the  English  manufacturers  that  any  further  progress  in  that  direction  was  impossible  and 
therefore that every further reduction of the hours of labour meant a lessened production The 
apparent correctness of their reasons will be best shown by the following contemporary statement 
by Leonard Horner the factory inspector their ever watchful censor 

Now as the quantity produced must in the main be regulated by the speed of 
the machinery it must be the interest of the millowner to drive it at the utmost 
rate of speed consistent with these following conditions viz the preservation of 
the machinery from too rapid deterioration the preservation of the quality of the 
article manufactured and the capability of the workman to follow the motion 
without a greater exertion than he can sustain for a constancy One of the most 
important problems therefore which the owner of a factory has to solve is to find 
out the maximum speed at which he can run with a due regard to the above 

 

 

 

Chapter  

conditions It frequently happens that he finds he has gone too fast that breakages 
and bad work more than counterbalance the increased speed and that he is 
obliged to slacken his pace I therefore concluded that as an active and intelligent 
millowner would find out the safe maximum it would not be possible to produce 
as much in eleven hours as in twelve I further assumed that the operative paid by 
piecework would exert himself to the utmost consistent with the power of 
continuing at the same rate  

Horner  therefore came  to  the  conclusion  that  a reduction  of the  working  hours  below twelve 
would necessarily diminish production He himself ten years later cites his opinion of  in 
proof  of  how  much  he  underestimated  in  that  year  the  elasticity  of  machinery  and  of  mans 
labourpower  both  of  which  are  simultaneously  stretched  to  an  extreme  by  the  compulsory 
shortening of the working day  
We now come to the period that follows the introduction of the Ten Hours Act in  into the 
English cotton woollen silk and flax mills  

The speed of the spindles has increased upon throstles  and upon mules 
 revolutions a minute ie the speed of the throstle spindle which in  
was  times a minute is now   and of the mule spindle that was 
 is now  times a minute amounting in the former case to onetenth 
and in the second case to onefifth additional increase  

James Nasmyth the eminent civil engineer of Patricroft near Manchester explained in a letter to 
Leonard Horner written in  the nature of the improvements in the steamengine that had 
been  made between the  years    and    After remarking  that  the  horsepower  of steam
engines being always estimated in the official returns according to the power of similar engines 
in  is only nominal and can serve only as an index of their real power he goes on to say 

I am confident that from the same weight of steamengine machinery we are 
now obtaining at least  per cent more duty or work performed on the average 
and that in many cases the identical steamengines which in the days of the 
restricted speed of  feet per minute yielded  horsepower are now yielding 
upwards of  The modern steamengine of  horsepower is capable of 
being driven at a much greater force than formerly arising from improvements in 
its construction the capacity and construction of the boilers c Although the 
same number of hands are employed in proportion to the horsepower as at former 
periods there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery In the 
year  the factories of the United Kingdom employed  nominal horse
power to give motion to  spindles and  looms The number of 
spindles and looms in  was respectively  of the former and 
 of the latter which reckoning the force of the nominal horsepower 
required to be the same as in  would require a force equal to  horses 
but the actual power given in the return for  is  less by above  
horses than calculating upon the basis of the return of  the factories ought to 
have required in   The facts thus brought out by the Return of  
appear to be that the factory system is increasing rapidly that although the same 
number of hands are employed in proportion to the horsepower as at former 
periods there are fewer hands employed in proportion to the machinery that the 
steamengine is enabled to drive an increased weight of machinery by economy of 
force and other methods and that an increased quantity of work can be turned off 

 

 

 

Chapter  

by improvements in machinery and in methods of manufacture by increase of 
speed of the machinery and by a variety of other causes  
The great improvements made in machines of every kind have raised their 
productive power very much Without any doubt the shortening of the hours of 
labour gave the impulse to these improvements The latter combined with the 
more intense strain on the workman have had the effect that at least as much is 
produced in the shortened by two hours or onesixth working day as was 
previously produced during the longer one  

One fact is sufficient to show how greatly the wealth of the manufacturers increased along with 
the  more  intense  exploitation  of  labourpower  From    to    the  average  proportional 
increase in English cotton and other factories was  while from  to  it amounted to 
  
But however great the progress of English industry had been during the  years from  to 
  under  the  influence  of  a  working  day  of    hours  it  was  far  surpassed  during  the  next 
period of  years from  to  In silk factories for instance there were in  spindles 
  in      in    looms    in      But  the  number  of 
operatives  was  in      in      The  increase  in  the  spindles  was  therefore 
 and in the looms  while the number of the operatives decreased  In the year 
  there  were  employed  in  worsted  mills    spindles  in      increase 
  and  in      decrease    But  if  we  deduct  the  doubling  spindles  that 
figure in the numbers for  but not in those for  it will be found that after  the 
number of spindles remained nearly stationary On the other hand after  the speed of the 
spindles and looms was in many cases doubled The number of powerlooms in worsted mills 
was in   in   in   The number of the operatives was in 
  in   in   included in these however the children under  
years of age were in   in   in   In spite therefore of the 
greatly  increased  number  of  looms  in    compared  with    the  total  number  of  the 
workpeople employed decreased and that of the children exploited increased  
On the th April  Mr Ferrand said in the House of Commons 

I have been informed by delegates from  districts of Lancashire and Cheshire 
in whose behalf I speak that the work in the factories is in consequence of the 
improvements in machinery constantly on the increase Instead of as formerly one 
person with two helps tenting two looms one person now tents three looms 
without helps and it is no uncommon thing for one person to tent four Twelve 
hours work as is evident from the facts adduced is now compressed into less 
than  hours It is therefore selfevident to what an enormous extent the toil of 
the factory operative has increased during the last  years  

Although therefore the Factory Inspectors unceasingly and with justice commend the results of 
the Acts of  and  yet they admit that the shortening of the hours of labour has already 
called forth such an intensification of the labour as is injurious to the health of the workman and 
to his capacity for work 

In most of the cotton worsted and silk mills an exhausting state of excitement 
necessary to enable the workers satisfactorily to mind the machinery the motion 
of which has been greatly accelerated within the last few years seems to me not 
unlikely to be one of the causes of that excess of mortality from lung disease 
which Dr Greenhow has pointed out in his recent report on this subject  

 

 

Chapter  
 
There cannot be the slightest doubt that the tendency that urges capital so soon as a prolongation 
of the hours of labour is once for all forbidden to compensate itself by a systematic heightening 
of the intensity of labour and to convert every improvement in machinery into a more perfect 
means of exhausting the workman must soon lead to a state of things in which a reduction of the 
hours  of  labour  will  again  be  inevitable  On  the  other  hand  the  rapid  advance  of  English 
industry between  and the present time under the influence of a day of  hours surpasses 
the advance made between  and  when the day was  hours long by far more than the 
latter surpasses the advance made during the half century after the first introduction of the factory 
system when the working day was without limits  

Section  The Factory 

At  the  commencement  of  this  chapter  we  considered  that  which  we  may  call  the  body  of  the 
factory ie machinery organised into a system We there saw how machinery by annexing the 
labour of women and children augments the number of human beings who form the material for 
capitalistic  exploitation  how  it  confiscates  the  whole  of  the  workmans  disposable  time  by 
immoderate  extension  of  the  hours  of  labour  and  how  finally  its  progress  which  allows  of 
enormous  increase  of  production  in  shorter  and  shorter  periods  serves  as  a  means  of 
systematically  getting  more  work  done  in  a  shorter  time  or  of  exploiting  labourpower  more 
intensely We now turn to the factory as a whole and that in its most perfect form  
Dr Ure the Pindar of the automatic factory describes it on the one hand as 

Combined cooperation of many orders of workpeople adult and young in 
tending with assiduous skill a system of productive machines continuously 
impelled by a central power the prime mover on the other hand as a vast 
automaton composed of various mechanical and intellectual organs acting in 
uninterrupted concert for the production of a common object all of them being 
subordinate to a selfregulated moving force  

These two descriptions are far from being identical In one the collective labourer or social body 
of labour appears as the dominant subject and the mechanical automaton as the object in the 
other  the  automaton  itself  is  the  subject  and  the  workmen  are  merely  conscious  organs  co
ordinate with the unconscious organs of the automaton and together with them subordinated to 
the  central  movingpower  The  first  description  is  applicable to  every  possible  employment  of 
machinery on a large scale the second is characteristic of its use by capital and therefore of the 
modern factory system Ure prefers therefore to describe the central machine from which the 
motion  comes  not  only  as  an  automaton  but  as  an  autocrat  In  these  spacious  halls  the 
benignant power of steam summons around him his myriads of willing menials 
Along  with  the  tool  the  skill  of  the  workman  in  handling  it  passes  over  to  the  machine  The 
capabilities  of  the  tool  are  emancipated  from  the  restraints  that  are  inseparable  from  human 
labourpower  Thereby  the  technical  foundation  on  which  is  based  the  division  of  labour  in 
Manufacture is swept away Hence in the place of the hierarchy of specialised workmen that 
characterises manufacture there steps in the automatic factory a tendency to equalise and reduce 
to  one  and  the  same  level  every  kind  of  work  that  has  to  be  done  by  the  minders  of  the 
machines in the place of the artificially produced differentiations of the detail workmen step 
the natural differences of age and sex  
So far as division of labour reappears in the factory it is primarily a distribution of the workmen 
among the specialised machines and of masses of workmen not however organised into groups 
among the various departments of the factory in each of which they work at a number of similar 

 

 

Chapter  
 
machines  placed  together  their  cooperation  therefore  is  only  simple  The  organised  group 
peculiar to manufacture is replaced by the connexion between the head workman and his few 
assistants The essential division is into workmen who are actually employed on the machines 
among whom are included a few who look after the engine and into mere attendants almost 
exclusively  children  of  these  workmen  Among  the  attendants  are  reckoned  more  or  less  all 
Feeders  who  supply  the  machines  with  the  material  to  be  worked  In  addition  to  these  two 
principal classes there is a numerically unimportant class of persons whose occupation it is to 
look  after  the  whole  of  the  machinery  and  repair  it  from  time  to  time  such  as  engineers 
mechanics  joiners  c  This  is  a  superior  class  of  workmen  some  of  them  scientifically 
educated others brought up to a trade it is distinct from the factory operative class and merely 
aggregated to it This division of labour is purely technical  
To work at a machine the workman should be taught from childhood in order that he may learn 
to adapt his own movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton When the 
machinery  as  a  whole  forms  a  system  of  manifold  machines  working  simultaneously  and  in 
concert the cooperation based upon it requires the distribution of various groups of workmen 
among the different kinds of machines But the employment of machinery does away with the 
necessity  of  crystallising  this  distribution  after  the  manner  of  Manufacture  by  the  constant 
annexation of a particular man to a particular function Since the motion of the whole system 
does not proceed from the workman but from the machinery a change of persons can take place 
at any time without an interruption of the work The most striking proof of this is afforded by the 
relays system put into operation by the manufacturers during their revolt from  Lastly 
the quickness with which machine work is learnt by young people does away with the necessity 
of  bringing  up  for  exclusive  employment  by  machinery  a  special  class  of  operatives  With 
regard  to  the  work  of  the  mere  attendants  it  can  to  some  extent  be  replaced  in  the  mill  by 
machines and owing to its extreme simplicity it allows of a rapid and constant change of the 
individuals burdened with this drudgery  
Although then technically speaking the old system of division of labour is thrown overboard by 
machinery it hangs on in the factory as a traditional habit handed down from Manufacture and 
is afterwards systematically remoulded and established in a more hideous form by capital as a 
means  of  exploiting  labourpower  The lifelong  speciality  of  handling  one  and  the  same  tool 
now becomes the lifelong speciality of serving one and the same machine Machinery is put to a 
wrong use with the object of transforming the workman from his very childhood into a part of a 
detailmachine  In  this  way  not  only  are  the  expenses  of  his  reproduction  considerably 
lessened but at the same time his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole and therefore 
upon the capitalist is rendered complete Here as everywhere else we must distinguish between 
the increased productiveness due to the development of the social process of production and that 
due to the capitalist exploitation of that process In handicrafts and manufacture the workman 
makes use of a tool in the factory the machine makes use of him There the movements of the 
instrument of labour proceed from him here it is the movements of the machine that he must 
follow In manufacture the workmen are parts of a living mechanism In the factory we have a 
lifeless mechanism independent of the workman who becomes its mere living appendage 
The miserable routine of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical 
process is gone through over and over again is like the labour of Sisyphus The 
burden of labour like the rock keeps ever falling back on the wornout 
labourer 

At the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost it does away 
with the manysided play of the muscles and confiscates every atom of freedom both in bodily 

 

 

Chapter  
 
and intellectual activity The lightening of the labour even becomes a sort of torture since the 
machine does not free the labourer from work but deprives the work of all interest Every kind of 
capitalist production in so far as it is not only a labourprocess but also a process of creating 
surplusvalue has this in common that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of 
labour  but  the  instruments  of  labour  that  employ  the  workman  But  it  is  only  in  the  factory 
system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality By means of 
its  conversion  into  an  automaton  the  instrument  of  labour  confronts  the  labourer  during  the 
labourprocess  in  the  shape  of  capital  of  dead  labour  that  dominates  and  pumps  dry  living 
labourpower The separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual labour 
and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over labour is as we have already 
shown  finally  completed  by  modern  industry  erected  on  the  foundation  of  machinery  The 
special  skill  of  each  individual  insignificant  factory  operative  vanishes  as  an  infinitesimal 
quantity before the science the gigantic physical forces and the mass of labour that are embodied 
in  the  factory  mechanism  and  together  with  that  mechanism  constitute  the  power  of  the 
master  This  master  therefore  in  whose  brain  the  machinery  and  his  monopoly  of  it  are 
inseparably united whenever he falls out with his hands contemptuously tells them 
The factory operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that 
theirs is really a low species of skilled labour and that there is none which is more 
easily acquired or of its quality more amply remunerated or which by a short 
training of the least expert can be more quickly as well as abundantly acquired 
The masters machinery really plays a far more important part in the business of 
production than the labour and the skill of the operative which six months 
education can teach and a common labourer can learn  

The technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments of labour 
and the peculiar composition of the body of workpeople consisting as it does of individuals of 
both sexes and of all ages give rise to a barrack discipline which is elaborated into a complete 
system  in  the  factory  and  which  fully  develops  the  before  mentioned  labour  of  overlooking 
thereby  dividing  the  workpeople  into  operatives  and  overlookers  into  private  soldiers  and 
sergeants of an industrial army The main difficulty in the automatic factory  lay  above all 
in training human beings to renounce their desultory habits of work and to identify themselves 
with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton To devise and administer a successful 
code  of  factory  discipline  suited  to  the  necessities  of  factory  diligence  was  the  Herculean 
enterprise  the  noble  achievement  of  Arkwright  Even  at  the  present  day  when  the  system  is 
perfectly organised and its labour lightened to the utmost it is found nearly impossible to convert 
persons past the age of puberty into useful factory hands The factory code in which capital 
formulates like a private legislator and at his own good will his autocracy over his workpeople 
unaccompanied by that division of responsibility in other matters so much approved of by the 
bourgeoisie and unaccompanied by the still more approved representative system this code is 
but  the  capitalistic  caricature  of  that  social  regulation  of  the  labourprocess  which  becomes

Section  The Strife Between Workman and Machine 

The contest between the capitalist and the wagelabourer dates back to the very origin of capital 
It  raged  on  throughout  the  whole  manufacturing  period    But  only  since  the introduction  of 
machinery  has  the  workman  fought  against  the  instrument  of  labour  itself  the  material 
embodiment  of  capital  He  revolts  against  this  particular  form  of  the  means  of  production  as 
being the material basis of the capitalist mode of production  
In the th century nearly all Europe experienced revolts of the workpeople against the ribbon
loom  a  machine  for  weaving  ribbons  and  trimmings  called  in  Germany  Bandmhle 
Schnurmhle and Mhlenstuhl These machines were invented in Germany Abb Lancellotti in 
a work that appeared in Venice in  but which was written in  says as follows 

Anthony Mller of Danzig saw about  years ago in that town a very ingenious 
machine which weaves  to  pieces at once But the Mayor being apprehensive 
that this invention might throw a large number of workmen on the streets caused 
the inventor to be secretly strangled or drowned  

In Leyden this machine was not used till  there the riots of the ribbonweavers at length 
compelled the Town Council to prohibit it 

In hac urbe says Boxhorn Inst Pol  referring to the introduction of this 
machine into Leyden ante hos viginti circiter annos instrumentum quidam 
invenerunt textorium quo solus plus panni et facilius conficere poterat quan 
plures aequali tempore Hinc turbae ortae et querulae textorum tandemque usus 
hujus instrumenti a magistratu prohibitus est  
In this town about twenty years ago certain people invented an instrument for 
weaving with which a single person could weave more cloth and more easily 
than many others in the same length of time As a result there arose disturbances 
and complaints from the weavers until the Town Council finally prohibited the 
use of this instrument 

After making various decrees more or less prohibitive against this loom in   c the 
States General of Holland at length permitted it to be used under certain conditions by the decree 
of the th December  It was also prohibited in Cologne in  at the same time that its 
introduction into England was causing disturbances among the workpeople By an imperial Edict 
of th Feb  its use was forbidden throughout all Germany In Hamburg it was burnt in 
public by order of the Senate The Emperor Charles VI on th Feb  renewed the edict of 
 and not till  was its use openly allowed in the Electorate of Saxony This machine 
which shook Europe to its foundations was in fact the precursor of the mule and the powerloom 
and of the industrial revolution of the th century It enabled a totally inexperienced boy to set 
the whole loom with all its shuttles in motion by simply moving a rod backwards and forwards 
and in its improved form produced from  to  pieces at once

About  a windsawmill erected near London by a Dutchman succumbed to the excesses of 
the  populace  Even  as  late  as  the  beginning  of  the  th  century  sawmills  driven  by  water 
overcame  the  opposition  of  the  people  supported  as  it  was  by  Parliament  only  with  great 
difficulty No sooner had Everet in  erected the first woolshearing machine that was driven 
by waterpower than it was set on fire by  people who had been thrown out of work 
Fifty  thousand  workpeople  who  had  previously  lived  by  carding  wool  petitioned  Parliament 
against Arkwrights scribbling mills and carding engines The enormous destruction of machinery 
that  occurred  in  the  English  manufacturing  districts  during  the  first    years  of  this  century 
chiefly caused by the employment of the powerloom and known as the Luddite movement gave 
the antiJacobin governments of a Sidmouth a Castlereagh and the like a pretext for the most 
reactionary and forcible measures It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt 
to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital and to direct their attacks not 
against the material instruments of production but against the mode in which they are used  
The contests about wages in Manufacture presuppose manufacture and are in no sense directed 
against  its  existence  The  opposition  against  the  establishment  of  new  manufactures  proceeds 
from  the  guilds  and  privileged  towns  not  from  the  workpeople  Hence  the  writers  of  the 
manufacturing  period  treat  the  division  of  labour  chiefly  as  a  means  of  virtually  supplying  a 
deficiency of labourers and not as a means of actually displacing those in work This distinction 
is selfevident If it be said that  millions of people would be required in England to spin with 
the old spinningwheel the cotton that is now spun with mules by  people this does not 
mean that the mules took the place of those millions who never existed It means only this that 
many  millions  of  workpeople  would  be required  to replace  the  spinning  machinery  If  on  the 
other hand we say that in England the powerloom threw  weavers on the streets we do 
not  refer  to  existing  machinery  that  would  have  to  be  replaced  by  a  definite  number  of 
workpeople but to a number of weavers in existence who were actually replaced or displaced by 
the looms During the manufacturing period handicraft labour altered though it was by division 
of  labour  was  yet  the  basis  The  demands  of  the  new  colonial  markets  could  not  be  satisfied 
owing to the relatively small number of town operatives handed down from the middle ages and 
the manufactures proper opened out new fields of production to the rural population driven from 
the land by the dissolution of the feudal system At that time therefore division of labour and co
operation  in  the  workshops  were  viewed  more  from  the  positive  aspect  that  they  made  the 
workpeople more productive Long before the period of modern industry cooperation and the 
concentration of the instruments of labour in the hands of a few gave rise in numerous countries 
where these methods were applied in agriculture to great sudden and forcible revolutions in the 
modes  of  production  and  consequentially  in  the  conditions  of  existence  and  the  means  of 
employment of the rural populations But this contest at first takes place more between the large 
and the small landed proprietors than between capital and wage labour on the other hand when 
the labourers are displaced by the instruments of labour by sheep horses c in this case force 
is directly resorted to in the first instance as the prelude to the industrial revolution The labourers 
are first driven from the land and then come the sheep Land grabbing on a great scale such as 
was perpetrated in England is the first step in creating a field for the establishment of agriculture 
on a great scale Hence this subversion of agriculture puts on at first more the appearance of a 
political revolution  
The  instrument  of  labour  when  it  takes  the  form  of  a  machine  immediately  becomes  a 
competitor of the workman himself The selfexpansion of capital by means of machinery is 
thenceforward directly proportional to the number of the workpeople whose means of livelihood 
have been destroyed by that machinery The whole system of capitalist production is based on the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
fact that the workman sells his labourpower as a commodity Division of labour specialises this 
labourpower by reducing it to skill in handling a particular tool So soon as the handling of this 
tool becomes  the  work  of a  machine  then  with the usevalue  the  exchangevalue  too  of  the 
workmans labourpower vanishes the workman becomes unsaleable like paper money thrown 
out  of  currency  by  legal  enactment  That  portion  of  the  workingclass  thus  by  machinery 
rendered  superfluous  ie  no  longer  immediately  necessary  for  the  selfexpansion  of  capital 
either  goes  to  the  wall  in  the  unequal  contest  of  the  old  handicrafts  and  manufactures  with 
machinery or else floods all the more easily accessible branches of industry swamps the labour
market and sinks the price of labourpower below its value It is impressed upon the workpeople 
as  a  great  consolation  first  that  their  sufferings  are  only  temporary  a  temporary 
inconvenience secondly that machinery acquires the mastery over the whole of a given field of 
production only by degrees so that the extent and intensity of its destructive effect is diminished 
The first consolation neutralises the second When machinery seizes on an industry by degrees it 
produces chronic misery among the operatives who compete with it Where the transition is rapid 
the effect is acute and felt by great masses History discloses no tragedy more horrible than the 
gradual extinction of the English handloom weavers an extinction that was spread over several 
decades  and  finally  sealed  in    Many  of  them  died  of  starvation  many  with  families 
vegetated for a long time on  d a day On the other hand the English cotton machinery 
produced an acute effect in India The Governor General reported  

The misery hardly finds a parallel in the history of commerce The bones of the 
cottonweavers are bleaching the plains of India  

No doubt in turning them out of this temporal world the machinery caused them no more than 
a temporary inconvenience For the rest since machinery is continually seizing upon new fields 
of production its temporary effect is really permanent Hence the character of independence and 
estrangement  which  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  as  a  whole  gives  to  the  instruments  of 
labour and to the product as against the workman is developed by means of machinery into a 
thorough antagonism Therefore it is with the advent of machinery that the workman for the 
first time brutally revolts against the instruments of labour  
The  instrument  of  labour  strikes  down  the  labourer  This  direct  antagonism  between  the  two 
comes  out  most  strongly  whenever  newly  introduced  machinery  competes  with  handicrafts  or 
manufactures  handed  down  from  former  times  But  even  in  modern  industry  the  continual 
improvement  of  machinery  and  the  development  of  the  automatic  system  has  an  analogous 
effect 

The object of improved machinery is to diminish manual labour to provide for 
the performance of a process or the completion of a link in a manufacture by the 
aid of an iron instead of the human apparatus The adaptation of power to 
machinery heretofore moved by hand is almost of daily occurrence  the minor 
improvements in machinery having for their object economy of power the 
production of better work the turning off more work in the same time or in 
supplying the place of a child a female or a man are constant and although 
sometimes apparently of no great moment have somewhat important results 
Whenever a process requires peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand it is 
withdrawn as soon as possible from the cunning workman who is prone to 
irregularities of many kinds and it is placed in charge of a peculiar mechanism so 
selfregulating that a child can superintend it On the automatic plan skilled 
labour gets progressively superseded The effect of improvements in 
machinery not merely in superseding the necessity for the employment of the 

 

 

 

Chapter  

same quantity of adult labour as before in order to produce a given result but in 
substituting one description of human labour for another the less skilled for the 
more skilled juvenile for adult female for male causes a fresh disturbance in the 
rate of wages The effect of substituting the selfacting mule for the common 
mule is to discharge the greater part of the men spinners and to retain adolescents 
and children 

The  extraordinary  power  of  expansion  of  the  factory  system  owing  to  accumulated  practical 
experience to the mechanical means at hand and to constant technical progress was proved to us 
by the giant strides of that system under the pressure of a shortened working day But who in 
  the  Zenith  year  of  the  English  cotton  industry  would  have  dreamt  of  the  galloping 
improvements in machinery and the corresponding displacement of working people called into 
being during the following  years under the stimulus of the American Civil War A couple of 
examples from the Reports of the Inspectors of Factories will suffice on this point A Manchester 
manufacturer states 

We formerly had  carding engines now we have  doing the same quantity 
of work We are doing with fewer hands by  at a saving in wages of  a
week Our estimated saving in waste is about  in the quantity of cotton 
consumed In another finespinning mill in Manchester I was informed that 
through increased speed and the adoption of some selfacting processes a 
reduction had been made in number of a fourth in one department and of above 
half in another and that the introduction of the combing machine in place of the 
second carding had considerably reduced the number of hands formerly 
employed in the cardingroom  

Another spinningmill is estimated to effect a saving of labour of  The Messrs Gilmour 
spinners at Manchester state In our blowingroom department we consider our expense with 
new machinery is fully onethird less in wages and hands  in the jackframe and drawingframe 
room about onethird less in expense and likewise onethird less in hands in the spinning room 
about onethird less in expenses But this is not all when our yarn goes to the manufacturers it is 
so much better by the application of our new machinery that they will produce a greater quantity 
of cloth and cheaper than from the yarn produced by old machinery Mr Redgrave further 
remarks in the same Report 

The reduction of hands against increased production is in fact constantly taking 
place in woollen mills the reduction commenced some time since and is 
continuing a few days since the master of a school in the neighbourhood of 
Rochdale said to me that the great falling off in the girls school is not only 
caused by the distress but by the changes of machinery in the woollen mills in 
consequence of which a reduction of  shorttimers had taken place

Hence between  and   cotton factories disappeared in other words more productive 
machinery on a larger scale was concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of capitalists The 
number  of  powerlooms  decreased  by    but  since  their  product  increased  in  the  same 
period an improved loom must have yielded more than an old one Lastly the number of spindles 
increased by  while the number of operatives decreased by  The temporary 
misery  inflicted  on  the  workpeople  by  the  cottoncrisis  was  heightened  and  from  being 
temporary made permanent by the rapid and persistent progress of machinery  
But machinery not only acts as a competitor who gets the better of the workman and is constantly 
on the point of making him superfluous It is also a power inimical to him and as such capital 
proclaims it from the roof tops and as such makes use of it It is the most powerful weapon for 
repressing strikes those periodical revolts of the workingclass against the autocracy of capital 
According to Gaskell the steamengine was from the very first an antagonist of human power an 
antagonist that enabled the capitalist to tread under foot the growing claims of the workmen who 
threatened the newly born factory system with a crisis It would be possible to write quite a 
history  of  the  inventions  made  since    for  the  sole  purpose  of  supplying  capital  with 
weapons against the revolts of the workingclass At the head of these in importance stands the 
selfacting mule because it opened up a new epoch in the automatic system  
Nasmyth  the  inventor  of  the  steamhammer  gives  the  following  evidence  before  the  Trades 
Union Commission with regard to the improvements made by him in machinery and introduced 
in consequence of the widespread and long strikes of the engineers in  

The characteristic feature of our modern mechanical improvements is the 
introduction of selfacting tool machinery What every mechanical workman has 
now to do and what every boy can do is not to work himself but to superintend 
the beautiful labour of the machine The whole class of workmen that depend 
exclusively on their skill is now done away with Formerly I employed four boys 
to every mechanic Thanks to these new mechanical combinations I have reduced 
the number of grownup men from  to  The result was a considerable 
increase in my profits

resources of science and were speedily reinstated in their legitimate rule that of 
the head over the inferior members  
Speaking of an invention for dressing warps 

Then the combined malcontents who fancied themselves impregnably 
entrenched behind the old lines of division of labour found their flanks turned and 
their defences rendered useless by the new mechanical tactics and were obliged to 
surrender at discretion  

With regard to the invention of the selfacting mule he says 

A creation destined to restore order among the industrious classes This 
invention confirms the great doctrine already propounded that when capital 
enlists science into her service the refractory hand of labour will always be taught 
docility  

Although  Ures  work  appeared    years  ago  at  a  time  when  the  factory  system  was 
comparatively but little developed it still perfectly expresses the spirit of the factory not only by 
its undisguised cynicism but also by the navet with which it blurts out the stupid contradictions 
of the capitalist brain For instance after propounding the doctrine stated above that capital 
with the aid of science taken into its pay always reduces the refractory hand of labour to docility 
he grows indignant because 

it physicomechanical science has been accused of lending itself to the rich 
capitalist as an instrument for harassing the poor  

After preaching a long sermon to show how advantageous the rapid development of machinery is 
to the workingclasses he warns them that by their obstinacy and their strikes they hasten that 
development 

Violent revulsions of this nature he says display shortsighted man in the 
contemptible character of a selftormentor  

A few pages before he states the contrary 

Had it not been for the violent collisions and interruptions resulting from 
erroneous views among the factory operatives the factory system would have 
been developed still more rapidly and beneficially for all concerned Then he 
exclaims again Fortunately for the state of society in the cotton districts of Great 
Britain the improvements in machinery are gradual It improvement in 
machinery is said to lower the rate of earnings of adults by displacing a portion 
of them and thus rendering their number superabundant as compared with the 
demand for their labour It certainly augments the demand for the labour of 
children and increases the rate of their wages  

On the other hand this same dispenser of consolation defends the lowness of the childrens wages 
on  the  ground  that it  prevents  parents from  sending  their children at too  early an  age  into  the 
factory  The  whole  of  his  book  is  a  vindication  of  a  working  day  of  unrestricted  length  that 
Parliament  should  forbid  children  of    years  to  be  exhausted  by  working    hours  a  day 
reminds his liberal soul of the darkest days of the Middle Ages This does not prevent him from 
calling upon the factory operatives to thank Providence who by means of machinery has given 
them the leisure to think of their immortal interests

Section  The Theory of Compensation as Regards the 

Workpeople Displaced by Machinery 

James  Mill  MacCulloch  Torrens  Senior  John  Stuart  Mill  and  a  whole  series  besides  of 
bourgeois political economists insist that all machinery that displaces workmen simultaneously 
and necessarily sets free an amount of capital adequate to employ the same identical workmen  
Suppose a capitalist to employ  workmen at  a year each in a carpet factory The variable 
capital annually laid out amounts therefore to  Suppose also that he discharges  of his 
workmen  and  employs  the  remaining    with  machinery  that  costs  him    To  simplify 
matters we take no account of buildings coal c Further suppose that the raw material annually 
consumed  costs    both  before  and  after  the  change  Is  any  capital  set  free  by  this 
metamorphosis Before the change the total sum of  consisted half of constant and half of 
variable capital After the change it consists of  constant   raw material and  
machinery and  variable capital The variable capital instead of being one half is only 
one quarter of the total capital Instead of being set free a part of the capital is here locked up in 
such a way as to cease to be exchanged against labourpower variable has been changed into 
constant capital Other things remaining unchanged the capital of  can in future employ 
no  more  than    men  With  each  improvement  in  the  machinery  it  will  employ  fewer  If  the 
newly introduced machinery had cost less than did the labourpower and implements displaced by 
it if for instance instead of costing  it had cost only  a variable capital of  
would have been converted into constant capital and locked up and a capital of  would have 
been  set  free  The  latter  sum  supposing  wages  unchanged  would  form  a  fund  sufficient  to 
employ about  out of the  men discharged nay less than  for in order to be employed as 
capital a part of this  must now become constant capital thus leaving only the remainder to 
be laid out in labourpower  
But  suppose  besides that  the  making  of  the  new  machinery  affords  employment to  a  greater 
number  of  mechanics  can  that  be  called  compensation  to  the  carpetmakers  thrown  on  the 
streets At the best its construction employs fewer men than its employment displaces The sum 
of  that formerly represented the wages of the discharged carpetmakers now represents in 
the shape of machinery  the value of the means of production used in the construction of that 
machinery  the wages of the mechanics employed in its construction and  the surplusvalue 
falling to the share of their master Further the machinery need not be renewed till it is worn 
out  Hence in  order  to  keep  the  increased  number  of  mechanics  in  constant employment  one 
carpet manufacturer after another must displace workmen by machines  
As a matter of fact the apologists do not mean this sort of setting free  
They  have  in  their  minds  the  means  of  subsistence  of  the  liberated  workpeople  It  cannot  be 
denied in the above instance that the machinery not only liberates  men thus placing them at 
others disposal but at the same time it withdraws from their consumption and sets free means 
of subsistence to the value of  The simple fact by no means a new one that machinery 
cuts  off  the  workmen  from  their  means  of  subsistence  is  therefore  in  economic  parlance 
tantamount to this that machinery liberates means of subsistence for the workman or converts 
those  means  into  capital  for  his employment  The  mode  of  expression  you  see  is  everything 
Nominibus mollire licet mala  
This  theory  implies  that  the    worth  of  means of  subsistence  was  capital  that  was  being 
expanded by the labour of the  men discharged That consequently this capital falls out of 
employment so soon as they commence their forced holidays and never rests till it has found a 
fresh  investment  where  it  can  again  be  productively  consumed  by  these  same    men  That 
 

 

Chapter  
 
sooner or later therefore the capital and the workmen must come together again and that then 
the compensation is complete That the sufferings of the workmen displaced by machinery are 
therefore as transient as are the riches of this world  
In  relation  to  the  discharged  workmen  the    worth  of  means  of  subsistence  never  was 
capital What really confronted them as capital was the sum of  afterwards laid out in 
machinery  On  looking  closer  it  will  be  seen  that  this  sum  represented  part  of  the  carpets 
produced  in  a  year  by  the    discharged  men  which  part  they  received  as  wages  from  their 
employer in money instead of in kind With the carpets in the form of money they bought means 
of  subsistence  to  the  value  of    These  means  therefore  were  to  them  not  capital  but 
commodities and they as regards these commodities were not wagelabourers but buyers The 
circumstance that they were freed by the machinery from the means of purchase changed them 
from buyers into nonbuyers Hence a lessened demand for those commodities  voil tout If this 
diminution be not compensated by an increase from some other quarter the market price of the 
commodities  falls  If  this  state  of  things  lasts  for  some  time  and  extends  there  follows  a 
discharge of workmen employed in the production of these commodities Some of the capital that 
was  previously  devoted  to  production  of  necessary  means  of  subsistence  has  to  become 
reproduced  in  another  form  While  prices  fall  and  capital  is  being  displaced  the  labourers 
employed in the production of necessary means of subsistence are in their turn freed from a part 
of their wages Instead therefore of proving that when machinery frees the workman from his 
means  of  subsistence  it  simultaneously  converts  those  means  into  capital  for  his  further 
employment our apologists with their cutanddried law of supply and demand prove on the 
contrary that machinery throws workmen on the streets not only in that branch of production in 
which it is introduced but also in those branches in which it is not introduced  
The real facts which are travestied by the optimism of economists are as follows The labourers 
when driven out of the workshop by the machinery are thrown upon the labour market and there 
add to the number of workmen at the disposal of the capitalists In Part VII of this book it will be 
seen that this effect of machinery which as we have seen is represented to be a compensation to 
the working class is on the contrary a most frightful scourge For the present I will only say this 
The  labourers  that  are  thrown  out  of  work  in  any  branch  of  industry  can  no  doubt  seek  for 
employment in some other branch If they find it and thus renew the bond between them and the 
means of subsistence this takes place only by the intermediary of a new and additional capital 
that is seeking investment not at all by the intermediary of the capital that formerly employed 
them and was afterwards converted into machinery And even should they find employment what 
a poor lookout is theirs Crippled as they are by division of labour these poor devils are worth so 
little outside their old trade that they cannot find admission into any industries except a few of 
inferior  kind  that  are  oversupplied  with  underpaid  workmen  Further  every  branch  of 
industry attracts each year a new stream of men who furnish a contingent from which to fill up 
vacancies  and  to  draw  a  supply  for  expansion  So  soon  as  machinery  sets  free  a  part  of  the 
workmen  employed  in  a  given  branch  of  industry  the  reserve  men  are also  diverted  into new 
channels  of  employment  and  become  absorbed  in  other  branches  meanwhile  the  original 
victims during the period of transition for the most part starve and perish  
It is an undoubted fact that machinery as such is not responsible for setting free the workman 
from the means of subsistence It cheapens and increases production in that branch which it seizes 
on  and  at  first  makes  no  change  in  the  mass  of  the  means  of  subsistence  produced  in  other 
branches  Hence  after  its  introduction  the  society  possesses  as  much  if  not  more  of  the 
necessaries of life than before for the labourers thrown out of work and that quite apart from the 
enormous share of the annual produce wasted by the nonworkers And this is the point relied on 

 

 

Chapter  
 
by  our  apologists  The  contradictions  and  antagonisms  inseparable  from  the  capitalist 
employment of machinery do not exist they say since they do not arise out of machinery as 
such but out of its capitalist employment Since therefore machinery considered alone shortens 
the hours of labour but when in the service of capital lengthens them since in itself it lightens 
labour  but  when  employed  by  capital  heightens  the  intensity  of  labour  since  in  itself  it  is  a 
victory of man over the forces of Nature but in the hands of capital makes man the slave of those 
forces since in itself it increases the wealth of the producers but in the hands of capital makes 
them  paupers    for  all these  reasons  and  others  besides  says  the bourgeois  economist  without 
more ado it is clear as noonday that all these contradictions are a mere semblance of the reality 
and that as a matter of fact they have neither an actual nor a theoretical existence Thus he saves 
himself from all further puzzling of the brain and what is more implicitly declares his opponent 
to  be  stupid  enough  to  contend  against  not  the  capitalistic  employment  of  machinery  but 
machinery itself  
No doubt he is far from denying that temporary inconvenience may result from the capitalist use 
of machinery But where is the medal without its reverse Any employment of machinery except 
by capital is to him an impossibility Exploitation of the workman by the machine is therefore 
with  him  identical  with  exploitation  of  the  machine  by  the  workman  Whoever  therefore 
exposes  the  real  state  of  things  in  the  capitalistic  employment  of  machinery  is  against  its 
employment  in  any  way  and  is  an  enemy  of  social  progress  Exactly  the  reasoning  of  the 
celebrated Bill Sykes Gentlemen of the jury no doubt the throat of this commercial traveller has 
been  cut  But  that  is  not  my  fault  it  is  the  fault  of  the  knife  Must  we  for  such  a  temporary 
inconvenience abolish the use of the knife Only consider where would agriculture and trade be 
without the knife Is it not as salutary in surgery as it is knowing in anatomy And in addition a 
willing help at the festive board If you abolish the knife  you hurl us back into the depths of 
barbarism 
Although  machinery  necessarily  throws  men  out  of  work  in  those  industries  into  which  it  is 
introduced  yet  it  may  notwithstanding  this  bring  about  an  increase  of  employment  in  other 
industries  This  effect  however  has  nothing  in  common  with  the  socalled  theory  of 
compensation  Since  every  article  produced  by  a  machine  is  cheaper  than  a  similar  article 
produced  by  hand  we  deduce  the  following  infallible  law  If  the  total  quantity  of  the  article 
produced  by  machinery  be  equal  to  the  total  quantity  of  the  article  previously  produced  by  a 
handicraft  or  by  manufacture  and  now  made  by  machinery  then  the total  labour  expended  is 
diminished The new labour spent on the instruments of labour on the machinery on the coal 
and  so  on  must  necessarily  be  less  than  the  labour  displaced  by  the  use  of  the  machinery 
otherwise the product of the machine would be as dear or dearer than the product of the manual 
labour But as a matter of fact the total quantity of the article produced by machinery with a 
diminished number of workmen instead of remaining equal to by far exceeds the total quantity 
of the handmade article that has been displaced Suppose that  yards of cloth have been 
produced  on  powerlooms  by  fewer  weavers  than  could  weave    yards  by  hand  In  the 
quadrupled  product  there  lies  four  times  as  much  raw  material  Hence  the  production  of  raw 
material must be quadrupled But as regards the instruments of labour such as buildings coal 
machinery and so on it is different the limit up to which the additional labour required for their 
production  can  increase  varies  with  the  difference  between  the  quantity  of  the  machinemade 
article and the quantity of the same article that the same number of workmen could make by 
hand  
Hence as the use of machinery extends in a given industry the immediate effect is to increase 
production  in  the  other  industries  that  furnish  the  first  with  means  of  production  How  far 

 

 

Chapter  
 
employment is thereby found for an increased number of men depends given the length of the 
working day and the intensity of labour on the composition of the capital employed ie on the 
ratio of its constant to its variable component This ratio in its turn varies considerably with the 
extent to which machinery has already seized on or is then seizing on those trades The number 
of  the  men  condemned  to  work  in  coal  and  metal  mines  increased  enormously  owing  to  the 
progress of the English factory system but during the last few decades this increase of number 
has been less rapid owing to the use of new machinery in mining A new type of workman 
springs  into  life  along  with  the  machine  namely  its  maker  We  have  already  learnt  that 
machinery has possessed itself even of this branch of production on a scale that grows greater 
every day As to raw material there is not the least doubt that the rapid strides of cotton 
spinning not only pushed on with tropical luxuriance the growth of cotton in the United States 
and with it the African slave trade but also made the breeding of slaves the chief business of the 
border slavestates When in  the first census of slaves was taken in the United States their 
number was  in  it had nearly reached four millions On the other hand it is no less 
certain  that  the  rise  of  the  English  woollen  factories  together  with  the  gradual  conversion  of 
arable land into sheep pasture brought about the superfluity of agricultural labourers that led to 
their being driven in masses into the towns Ireland having during the last twenty years reduced 
its  population  by  nearly  one  half  is  at  this  moment  undergoing  the  process  of  still  further 
reducing the number of its inhabitants so as exactly to suit the requirements of its landlords and 
of the English woollen manufacturers  
When machinery is applied to any of the preliminary or intermediate stages through which the 
subject of labour has to pass on its way to completion there is an increased yield of material in 
those  stages  and  simultaneously  an  increased  demand  for  labour  in  the  handicrafts  or 
manufactures  supplied  by  the  produce  of  the  machines  Spinning  by  machinery  for  example 
supplied yarn so cheaply and so abundantly that the handloom weavers were at first able to 
work  full  time  without  increased  outlay  Their  earnings  accordingly  rose  Hence  a  flow  of 
people into the cottonweaving trade till at length the  weavers called into existence by 
the Jenny the throstle and the mule were overwhelmed by the powerloom So also owing to the 
abundance of clothing materials produced by machinery the number of tailors seamstresses and 
needlewomen went on increasing until the appearance of the sewingmachine  
In proportion as machinery with the aid of a relatively small number of workpeople increases 
the mass of raw materials intermediate products instruments of labour c the workingup of 
these raw materials and intermediate products becomes split up into numberless branches social 
production  increases  in  diversity  The  factory  system  carries  the  social  division  of  labour 
immeasurably further than does manufacture for it increases the productiveness of the industries 
it seizes upon in a far higher degree  
The immediate result of machinery is to augment surplusvalue and the mass of products in which 
surplusvalue  is  embodied  And  as  the  substances  consumed  by  the  capitalists  and  their 
dependents become more plentiful so too do these orders of society Their growing wealth and 
the relatively diminished number of workmen required to produce the necessaries of life beget 
simultaneously with the rise of new and luxurious wants the means of satisfying those wants A 
larger portion of the produce of society is changed into surplusproduce and a larger part of the 
surplusproduce is supplied for consumption in a multiplicity of refined shapes In other words 
the production of luxuries increases The refined and varied forms of the products are also due 
to new relations with the markets of the world relations that are created by modern industry Not 
only  are  greater  quantities  of  foreign  articles  of  luxury  exchanged  for  home  products  but  a 
greater mass of foreign raw materials ingredients and intermediate products are used as means 

 

 

Chapter  
 
of production in the home industries Owing to these relations with the markets of the world the 
demand for labour increases in the carrying trades which split up into numerous varieties  
The increase of the means of production and subsistence accompanied by a relative diminution in 
the number of labourers causes an increased demand for labour in making canals docks tunnels 
bridges  and  so  on  works  that  can  only  bear  fruit  in  the  far  future  Entirely  new  branches  of 
production creating new fields of labour are also formed as the direct result either of machinery 
or of the general industrial changes brought about by it But the place occupied by these branches 
in  the  general  production  is  even  in  the  most  developed  countries  far  from  important  The 
number of labourers that find employment in them is directly proportional to the demand created 
by those industries for the crudest form of manual labour The chief industries of this kind are at 
present  gasworks  telegraphs  photography  steam  navigation  and  railways  According  to  the 
census  of    for  England  and Wales  we find  in  the  gas  industry  gasworks  production  of 
mechanical apparatus servants of the gas companies c  persons in telegraphy  
in photography  steam navigation  and in railways  of whom the unskilled 
navvies  more  or  less  permanently  employed  and  the  whole  administrative  and  commercial 
staff make up about  The total number of persons therefore employed in these five new 
industries amounts to   
Lastly the extraordinary productiveness of modern industry accompanied as it is by both a more 
extensive  and  a  more  intense  exploitation  of  labourpower  in  all  other  spheres  of  production 
allows of the unproductive employment of a larger and larger part of the workingclass and the 
consequent reproduction on a constantly extending scale of the ancient domestic slaves under 
the name of a servant class including menservants womenservants lackeys c According to 
the census of  the population of England and Wales was  of these  
males  and    females  If  we  deduct  from  this  population  all  who  are  too  old  or  too 
young for work all unproductive women young persons and children the ideological classes 
such as government officials priests lawyers soldiers c further all who have no occupation 
but  to  consume  the  labour  of  others  in  the  form  of  rent  interest  c  and  lastly  paupers 
vagabonds and criminals there remain in round numbers eight millions of the two sexes of every 
age including in that number every capitalist who is in any way engaged in industry commerce 
or finance Among these  millions are  

  
Agricultural  labourers  including 
shepherds  farm servants and 
maidservants living in the  houses of

Section  Repulsion and Attraction of Workpeople by the 

Factory System Crises in the Cotton Trade 

All  political  economists  of  any  standing  admit  that  the  introduction  of  new  machinery  has  a 
baneful effect on the workmen in the old handicrafts and manufactures with which this machinery 
at first competes Almost all of them bemoan the slavery of the factory operative And what is the 
great trumpcard that they play That machinery after the horrors of the period of introduction 
and development have subsided instead of diminishing in the long run increases the number of 
the  slaves  of  labour  Yes  Political  Economy  revels  in  the  hideous  theory  hideous  to  every 
philanthropist who believes in the eternal Natureordained necessity for capitalist production 
that after a period of growth and transition even its crowning success the factory system based 
on  machinery  grinds  down  more  workpeople  than  on  its  first  introduction  it  throws  on  the 
streets 
It is true that in some cases as we saw from instances of English worsted and silk factories an 
extraordinary  extension  of  the  factory  system  may  at  a  certain  stage  of  its  development  be 
accompanied  not  only  by  a  relative  but  by  an  absolute  decrease  in  the  number  of  operatives 
employed In the year  when a special census of all the factories in the United Kingdom was 
taken by order of Parliament the factories in those parts of Lancashire Cheshire and Yorkshire 
included in the district of Mr Baker the factory inspector numbered   of these contained 
  powerlooms    spindles  exclusive  of  doubling  spindles  employed   
horsepower steam and  water and  persons In the year  the same factories 
contained looms  spindles  had a steampower of  horses and a water
power  of    horses  and  employed    persons  Between    and    therefore  the 
increase  in  looms  was    in  spindles    and  in  enginepower    while  the  number  of 
persons  employed  decreased    Between    and    considerable  extension  of  the 
English  woollen  manufacture  took  place  while  the  number  of  hands  employed  in  it  remained 
almost stationary  

showing how greatly the introduction of new machines had superseded the 
labour of preceding periods  

In certain cases the increase in the number of hands employed is only apparent that is it is not 
due  to  the  extension  of  the  factories  already  established  but  to  the  gradual  annexation  of 
connected trades for instance the increase in powerlooms and in the hands employed by them 
between  and  was in the cotton trade simply owing to the extension of this branch of 
industry  but  in  the  other  trades  to  the  application  of  steampower  to  the  carpetloom  to  the 
ribbonloom and to the linenloom which previously had been worked by the power of men 
Hence the increase of the hands in these latter trades was merely a symptom of a diminution in 
the total number employed Finally we have considered this question entirely apart from the fact 
that  everywhere  except  in  the  metal  industries  young  persons  under    and  women  and 
children form the preponderating element in the class of factory hands  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Nevertheless  in  spite  of  the  mass  of  hands  actually  displaced  and  virtually  replaced  by 
machinery we can understand how the factory operatives through the building of more mills and 
the  extension  of  old  ones  in  a  given  industry  may  become  more  numerous  than  the 
manufacturing workmen and handicraftsman that have been displaced Suppose for example that 
in the old mode of production a capital of  is employed weekly twofifths being constant 
and threefifths variable capital ie  being laid out in means of production and  say  
per  man  in  labourpower  On  the  introduction  of  machinery  the  composition  of  this  capital 
becomes  altered  We  will  suppose  it  to  consist  of  fourfifths  constant  and  onefifth  variable 
which  means  that  only    is  now laid  out  in labourpower  Consequently  twothirds  of the 
workmen are discharged If now the business extends and the total capital employed grows to 
 under unchanged conditions the number of operatives employed will increase to  just 
as many as before the introduction of the machinery If the capital further grows to   
men will be employed or onethird more than under the old system Their numbers have in point 
of fact increased by  but relatively ie in proportion to the total capital advanced they have 
diminished by  for the  capital would in the old state of things have employed  
instead of  men Hence a relative decrease in the number of hands is consistent with an actual 
increase We assumed above that while the total capital increases its composition remains the 
same because the conditions of production remain constant But we have already seen that with 
every  advance  in  the  use  of  machinery  the  constant  component  of  capital  that  part  which 
consists of machinery raw material c increases while the variable component the part laid 
out  in  labourpower  decreases  We  also  know  that  in  no  other  system  of  production  is 
improvement so continuous and the composition of the capital employed so constantly changing 
as in the factory system These changes are however continually interrupted by periods of rest 
during which there is a mere quantitative extension of the factories on the existing technical basis 
During  such  periods  the  operatives  increase  in  number  Thus  in    the  total  number  of 
operatives in the cotton woollen worsted flax and silk factories of the United Kingdom was 
only  while in  the number of the powerloom weavers alone of both sexes and of 
all  ages  from  eight  years  upwards  amounted  to    Certainly  this  growth  appears  less 
important  when  we  consider  that  in    the  handloom  weavers  with  their  families  still 
numbered  not to mention those thrown out of work in Asia and on the Continent of 
Europe  
In  the  few  remarks  I  have  still  to  make  on  this  point  I  shall  refer  to  some  actually  existing 
relations the existence of which our theoretical investigation has not yet disclosed  
So long as in a given branch of industry the factory system extends itself at the expense of the 
old handicrafts or of manufacture the result is as sure as is the result of an encounter between an 
army  furnished  with  breachloaders  and  one  armed  with  bows  and  arrows  This  first  period 
during  which  machinery  conquers  its  field  of  action  is  of  decisive  importance  owing  to  the 
extraordinary profits that it helps to produce These profits not only form a source of accelerated 
accumulation but also attract into the favoured sphere of production a large part of the additional 
social capital that is being constantly created and is ever on the lookout for new investments 
The special advantages of this first period of fast and furious activity are felt in every branch of 
production that machinery invades So soon however as the factory system has gained a certain 
breadth of footing and a definite degree of maturity and especially so soon as its technical basis 
machinery is itself produced by machinery so soon as coal mining and iron mining the metal 
industries and the means of transport have been revolutionised so soon in short as the general 
conditions requisite for production by the modern industrial system have been established this 
mode of production acquires an elasticity a capacity for sudden extension by leaps and bounds

that finds no hindrance except in the supply of raw material and in the disposal of the produce 
On the one hand the immediate effect of machinery is to increase the supply of raw material in 
the same way for example as the cotton gin augmented the production of cotton On the other 
hand the cheapness of the articles produced by machinery and the improved means of transport 
and communication furnish the weapons for conquering foreign markets By ruining handicraft 
production in other countries machinery forcibly converts them into fields for the supply of its 
raw  material  In  this  way  East  India  was  compelled  to  produce  cotton  wool  hemp  jute  and 
indigo for Great Britain By constantly making a part of the hands supernumerary modern 
industry  in  all  countries  where  it  has  taken  root  gives  a  spur  to  emigration  and  to  the 
colonisation of foreign lands which are thereby converted into settlements for growing the raw 
material of the mother country just as Australia for example was converted into a colony for 
growing wool A new and international division of labour a division suited to the requirements 
of  the  chief  centres  of  modern  industry  springs  up  and  converts  one  part  of  the  globe  into  a 
chiefly  agricultural  field  of  production  for  supplying  the  other  part  which  remains  a  chiefly 
industrial field This revolution hangs together with radical changes in agriculture which we need 
not here further inquire into

Chapter  
 
The enormous power inherent in the factory system of expanding by jumps and the dependence 
of that system on the markets of the world necessarily beget feverish production followed by 
overfilling  of  the  markets  whereupon  contraction  of  the  markets  brings  on  crippling  of 
production  The  life  of  modern  industry  becomes  a  series  of  periods  of  moderate  activity 
prosperity  overproduction  crisis  and  stagnation  The  uncertainty  and  instability  to  which 
machinery  subjects  the  employment  and  consequently  the  conditions  of  existence  of  the 
operatives become normal owing to these periodic changes of the industrial cycle Except in the 
periods of prosperity there rages between the capitalists the most furious combat for the share of 
each in the markets This share is directly proportional to the cheapness of the product Besides 
the rivalry that this struggle begets in the application of improved machinery for replacing labour
power and of new methods of production there also comes a time in every industrial cycle when 
a forcible reduction of wages beneath the value of labourpower is attempted for the purpose of 
cheapening commodities 
A necessary condition therefore to the growth of the number of factory hands is a proportionally 
much  more  rapid  growth  of  the  amount  of  capital  invested  in  mills  This  growth  however  is 
conditioned by the ebb and flow of the industrial cycle It is besides constantly interrupted by 
the technical progress that at one time virtually supplies the place of new workmen at another 
actually displaces old ones This qualitative change in mechanical industry continually discharges 
hands from the factory or shuts its doors against the fresh stream of recruits while the purely 
quantitative extension of the factories absorbs not only the men thrown out of work but also fresh 
contingents The workpeople are thus continually both repelled and attracted hustled from pillar 
to  post  while  at  the  same  time  constant  changes  take  place  in  the  sex  age  and  skill  of  the 
levies  
The lot of the factory operatives will be best depicted by taking a rapid survey of the course of the 
English cotton industry

famine  to  complete collapse  
The  history  of  the  cotton  famine  is  too  characteristic  to  dispense  with  dwelling  upon  it  for  a 
moment From the indications as to the condition of the markets of the world in  and  
we see that the cotton famine came in the nick of time for the manufacturers and was to some 
extent  advantageous  to  them  a  fact  that  was  acknowledged  in  the  reports  of  the  Manchester 
Chamber of Commerce proclaimed in Parliament by Palmerston and Derby and confirmed by 
events No doubt among the  cotton mills in the United Kingdom in  there were 
many of small size According to the report of Mr A Redgrave out of the  mills included 
in his district  or  employed less than ten horsepower each  or  employed  
H P and less than  H P while  employed upwards of  H P The majority of the 
small mills were weaving sheds built during the period of prosperity after  for the most part 
by speculators of whom one supplied the yarn another the machinery a third the buildings and 
were worked by men who had been overlookers or by other persons of small means These small 
manufacturers  mostly  went  to  the  wall  The  same  fate  would  have  overtaken  them  in  the 
commercial crisis that was staved off only by the cotton famine Although they formed onethird 
of the total number of manufacturers yet their mills absorbed a much smaller part of the capital 
invested in the cotton trade As to the extent of the stoppage it appears from authentic estimates 
that in October   of the spindles and  of the looms were standing This refers to 
the  cotton  trade  as  a  whole  and  of  course  requires  considerable  modification  for  individual 
districts  Only  very  few  mills  worked  full  time    hours  a  week  the  remainder  worked  at 
intervals Even in those few cases where full time was worked and at the customary rate of piece
wage  the  weekly  wages  of  the  operatives  necessarily  shrank  owing  to  good  cotton  being 
replaced  by  bad  Sea  Island  by  Egyptian  in  fine  spinning  mills  American  and  Egyptian  by 
Surat and pure cotton by mixings of waste and Surat The shorter fibre of the Surat cotton and its 
dirty condition the greater fragility of the thread the substitution of all sorts of heavy ingredients 
for flour in sizing the warps all these lessened the speed of the machinery or the number of the 
looms that could be superintended by one weaver increased the labour caused by defects in the 
machinery and reduced the piecewage by reducing the mass of the product turned off Where 
Surat cotton was used the loss to the operatives when on full time amounted to   and more 
per cent But besides this the majority of the manufacturers reduced the rate of piecewage by  
 and  per cent We can therefore conceive the situation of those hands who were employed 
for only   or  days a week or for only  hours a day Even in  after a comparative 
improvement had set in the weekly wages of spinners and of weavers were s d s d s 
d and s d Even in this miserable state of things however the inventive spirit of the master 
never stood still but was exercised in making deductions from wages These were to some extent 
inflicted as a penalty for defects in the finished article that were really due to his bad cotton and 
to  his  unsuitable  machinery  Moreover  where  the  manufacturer  owned  the  cottages  of  the 
workpeople he paid himself his rents by deducting the amount from these miserable wages Mr 
Redgrave tells us of selfacting minders operatives who manage a pair of selfacting mules 

earning at the end of a fortnights full work s d and that from this sum was 
deducted the rent of the house the manufacturer however returning half the rent 
as a gift The minders took away the sum of s d In many places the self

 

 

 

Chapter  

acting minders ranged from s to s per week and the weavers from s to s 
per week during the latter part of  

Even  when  working  short  time  the  rent  was  frequently  deducted  from  the  wages  of  the 
operatives No wonder that in some parts of Lancashire a kind of famine fever broke out But 
more characteristic than all this was the revolution that took place in the process of production at 
the expense of the workpeople Experimenta in corpore vili like those of anatomists on frogs 
were formally made  

Although says Mr Redgrave I have given the actual earnings of the 
operatives in the several mills it does not follow that they earn the same amount 
week by week The operatives are subject to great fluctuation from the constant 
experimentalising of the manufacturers  the earnings of the operatives rise and 
fall with the quality of the cotton mixings sometimes they have been within  
per cent of former earnings and then in a week or two they have fallen off from 
 to  per cent  

These experiments were not made solely at the expense of the workmans means of subsistence 
His five senses also had to pay the penalty 

The people who are employed in making up Surat cotton complain very much 
They inform me on opening the bales of cotton there is an intolerable smell 
which causes sickness In the mixing scribbling and carding rooms the dust and 
dirt which are disengaged irritate the air passages and give rise to cough and 
difficulty of breathing A disease of the skin no doubt from the irritation of the 
dirt contained in the Surat cotton also prevails The fibre being so short a great 
amount of size both animal and vegetable is used Bronchitis is more prevalent 
owing to the dust Inflammatory sore throat is common from the same cause 
Sickness and dyspepsia are produced by the frequent breaking of the weft when 
the weaver sucks the weft through the eye of the shuttle On the other hand the 
substitutes for flour were a Fortunatus purse to the manufacturers by increasing 
the weight of the yarn They caused  lbs of raw material to weigh  lbs after 
it was woven  

In the Report of Inspectors of Factories for th April  we read as follows 

The trade is availing itself of this resource at present to an extent which is even 
discreditable I have heard on good authority of a cloth weighing  lbs which was 
made of   lbs cotton and   lbs size and of another cloth weighing   
lbs of which  lbs was size These were ordinary export shirtings In cloths of 
other descriptions as much as  per cent size is sometimes added so that a 
manufacturer may and does truly boast that he is getting rich by selling cloth for 
less money per pound than he paid for the mere yarn of which they are 
composed  

But the workpeople had to suffer not only from the experiments of the manufacturers inside the 
mills and of the municipalities outside not only from reduced wages and absence of work from 
want and from charity and from the eulogistic speeches of lords and commons 

Unfortunate females who in consequence of the cotton famine were at its 
commencement thrown out of employment and have thereby become outcasts of 
society and now though trade has revived and work is plentiful continue 
members of that unfortunate class and are likely to continue so There are also in 
the borough more youthful prostitutes than I have known for the last  years

Section  Revolution Effected in Manufacture Handicrafts 

and Domestic Industry by Modern Industry 

A Overthrow of Cooperation Based on Handicraft and on 

the Division of Labour 

We  have  seen  how  machinery  does  away  with  cooperation  based  on  handicrafts  and  with 
manufacture  based  on  the  division  of  handicraft  labour  An  example  of  the  first  sort  is  the 
mowingmachine  it  replaces  cooperation  between mowers  A  striking  example  of  the  second 
kind is the needlemaking machine According to Adam Smith  men in his day made in co
operation over  needles aday On the other hand a single needlemachine makes  
in a working day of  hours One woman or one girl superintends four such machines and so 
produces near upon  needles in a day and upwards of  in a week A single 
machine when it takes the place of cooperation or of manufacture may itself serve as the basis 
of an industry of a handicraft character Still such a return to handicrafts is but a transition to the 
factory system which as a rule makes its appearance so soon as the human muscles are replaced 
for the purpose of driving the machines by a mechanical motive power such as steam or water 
Here and there but in any case only for a time an industry may be carried on on a small scale 
by means of mechanical power This is effected by hiring steampower as is done in some of the 
Birmingham trades or by the use of small caloricengines as in some branches of weaving In 
the Coventry silk weaving industry the experiment of cottage factories was tried In the centre 
of a square surrounded by rows of cottages an enginehouse was built and the engine connected 
by shafts with the looms in the cottages In all cases the power was hired at so much per loom 
The rent was payable weekly whether the looms worked or not Each cottage held from  to  
looms some belonged to the weaver some were bought on credit some were hired The struggle 
between these cottage factories and the factory proper lasted over  years It ended with the 
complete ruin of the  cottage factories Wherever the nature of the process did not involve 
production on a large scale the new industries that have sprung up in the last few decades such 
as  envelope  making  steelpen  making  c  have  as  a  general  rule  first  passed  through  the 
handicraft  stage  and  then the  manufacturing  stage  as  short  phases of transition  to the  factory 
stage  The  transition  is  very  difficult  in  those  cases  where  the  production  of  the  article  by 
manufacture  consists  not  of  a  series  of  graduated  processes  but  of  a  great  number  of 
disconnected ones This circumstance formed a great hindrance to the establishment of steelpen 
factories Nevertheless about  years ago a machine was invented that automatically performed 
 separate operations at once The first steelpens were supplied by the handicraft system in the 
year  at  s the gross in  theywere supplied by manufacture at s and today the 
factory system supplies them to the trade at from  to d the gross

B Reaction of the Factory System on Manufacture and 

Domestic Industries 

Along  with  the  development  of  the  factory  system  and  of  the  revolution  in  agriculture  that 
accompanies it production in all the other branches of industry not only extends but alters its 
character The principle carried out in the factory system of analysing the process of production 
into  its  constituent  phases  and  of  solving  the  problems  thus  proposed  by  the  application  of 
mechanics of chemistry and of the whole range of the natural sciences becomes the determining 
principle everywhere Hence machinery squeezes itself into the manufacturing industries first for 
one detail process then for another Thus the solid crystal of their organisation based on the old 
division  of labour becomes  dissolved and  makes  way  for  constant  changes  Independently  of 
this a radical change takes place in the composition of the collective labourer a change of the 
persons working in combination In contrast with the manufacturing period the division of labour 
is thenceforth based wherever possible on the employment of women of children of all ages 
and  of  unskilled  labourers  in  one  word  on  cheap  labour  as  it  is  characteristically  called  in 
England  This  is  the  case  not  only  with  all  production  on  a  large  scale  whether  employing 
machinery or not but also with the socalled domestic industry whether carried on in the houses 
of the workpeople or in small workshops This modern socalled domestic industry has nothing 
except the name in common with the oldfashioned domestic industry the existence of which 
presupposes  independent  urban  handicrafts  independent  peasant  farming  and  above  all  a 
dwellinghouse  for  the  labourer  and  his  family  That  oldfashioned  industry  has  now  been 
converted into an outside department of the factory the manufactory or the warehouse Besides 
the factory operatives the manufacturing workmen and the handicraftsman whom it concentrates 
in large  masses  at  one  spot  and  directly  commands  capital also  sets  in  motion  by  means  of 
invisible threads another army that of the workers in the domestic industries who dwell in the 
large towns and are also scattered over the face of the country An example The shirt factory of 
Messrs Tillie at Londonderry which employs  operatives in the factory itself and  
people spread up and down the country and working in their own houses  
The exploitation of cheap and immature labourpower is carried out in a more shameless manner 
in modern Manufacture than in the factory proper This is because the technical foundation of the 
factory system namely the substitution of machines for muscular power and the light character 
of the labour is almost entirely absent in Manufacture and at the same time women and over
young  children are subjected  in  a  most  unconscionable  way  to  the  influence of  poisonous  or 
injurious substances This exploitation is more shameless in the socalled domestic industry than 
in manufactures and that because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with their 
dissemination because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate themselves between the 
employer and the workman because a domestic industry has always to compete either with the 
factory system or with manufacturing in the same branch of production because poverty robs the 
workman of the conditions most essential to his labour of space light and ventilation because 
employment becomes more and more irregular and finally because in these the last resorts of 
the masses made redundant by modern industry and Agriculture competition for work attains 
its maximum Economy in the means of production first systematically carried out in the factory 
system  and  there  from  the  very  beginning  coincident  with  the  most  reckless  squandering  of 
labourpower and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour  this economy now 
shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and more in a given branch of industry the less 
the social productive power of labour and the technical basis for a combination of processes are 
developed in that branch  

 

 

 

C Modern Manufacture 

Chapter  

I now proceed by a few examples to illustrate the principles laid down above As a matter of 
fact the reader is already familiar with numerous instances given in the chapter on the working 
day In the hardware manufactures of Birmingham and the neighbourhood there are employed 
mostly in very heavy work  children and young persons besides  women There 
they are to be seen in the unwholesome brassfoundries button factories enamelling galvanising 
and lackering works Owing to the excessive labour of their workpeople both adult and non
adult certain London houses where newspapers and books are printed have got the illomened 
name of slaughterhouses Similar excesses are practised in bookbinding where the victims 
are chiefly women girls and children young persons have to do heavy work in ropewalks and 
nightwork in salt mines candle manufactories and chemical works young people are worked to 
death at turning the looms in silk weaving when it is not carried on by machinery One of the 
most shameful the most dirty and the worst paid kinds of labour and one on which women and 
young girls are by preference employed is the sorting of rags It is well known that Great Britain 
apart from its own immense store of rags is the emporium for the rag trade of the whole world 
They flow in from Japan from the most remote States of South America and from the Canary 
Islands But the chief sources of their supply are Germany France Russia Italy Egypt Turkey 
Belgium and Holland They are used for manure for making bedflocks for shoddy and they 
serve as the raw material of paper The ragsorters are the medium for the spread of smallpox 
and other infectious diseases and they themselves are the first victims A classical example of 
overwork of hard and inappropriate labour and of its brutalising effects on the workman from 
his childhood upwards is afforded not only by coalmining and miners generally but also by tile 
and brick making in which industry the recently invented machinery is in England used only 
here and there Between May and September the work lasts from  in the morning till  in the 
evening and where the drying is done in the open air it often lasts from  in the morning till  in 
the  evening  Work  from    in  the  morning  till    in  the  evening  is  considered  reduced  and 
moderate Both boys and girls of  and even of  years of age are employed They work for the 
same  number  of  hours  often  longer  than  the  adults  The  work  is  hard  and  the  summer  heat 
increases the exhaustion In a certain tilefield at Mosley eg a young woman  years of age 
was in the habit of making  tiles a day with the assistance of  little girls who carried the 
clay for her and stacked the tiles These girls carried daily  tons up the slippery sides of the 
clay pits from a depth of  feet and then for a distance of  feet 

It is impossible for a child to pass through the purgatory of a tilefield without 
great moral degradation the low language which they are accustomed to hear 
from their tenderest years the filthy indecent and shameless habits amidst 
which unknowing and half wild they grow up make them in afterlife lawless 
abandoned dissolute A frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of living 
Each moulder who is always a skilled labourer and the chief of a group supplies 
his  subordinates with board and lodging in his cottage Whether members of his 
family or not the men boys and girls all sleep in the cottage which contains 
generally two exceptionally  rooms all on the ground floor and badly 
ventilated These people are so exhausted after the days hard work that neither 
the rules of health of cleanliness nor of decency are in the least observed Many 
of these cottages are models of untidiness dirt and dust The greatest evil of the 
system that employs young girls on this sort of work consists in this that as a 
rule it chains them fast from childhood for the whole of their afterlife to the most 
abandoned rabble They become rough foulmouthed boys before Nature has 

 

 

 

Chapter  

taught them that they are women Clothed in a few dirty rags the legs naked far 
above the knees hair and face besmeared with dirt they learn to treat all feelings 
of decency and of shame with contempt During mealtimes they lie at full length 
in the fields or watch the boys bathing in a neighbouring canal Their heavy days 
work at length completed they put on better clothes and accompany the men to 
the public houses  

That excessive insobriety is prevalent from childhood upwards among the whole of this class is 
only natural 

The worst is that the brickmakers despair of themselves You might as well said 
one of the better kind to a chaplain of Southallfield try to raise and improve the 
devil as a brickie sir  

As  to  the  manner  in  which  capital  effects  an  economy  in  the  requisites  of  labour  in  modern 
Manufacture in which I include all workshops of larger size except factories proper official 
and most ample material bearing on it is to be found in the Public Health Reports IV  and 
VI  The description of the workshops more especially those of the London printers and 
tailors surpasses the most loathsome phantasies of our romance writers The effect on the health 
of the workpeople is selfevident Dr Simon the chief medical officer of the Privy Council and 
the official editor of the Public Health Reports says 

In my fourth Report  I showed how it is practically impossible for the 
workpeople to insist upon that which is their first sanitary right viz the right that 
no matter what the work for which their employer brings them together the 
labour so far as it depends upon him should be freed from all avoidably 
unwholesome conditions I pointed out that while the workpeople are practically 
incapable of doing themselves this sanitary justice they are unable to obtain any 
effective support from the paid administrations of the sanitary police The life of 
myriads of workmen and workwomen is now uselessly tortured and shortened by 
the neverending physical suffering that their mere occupation begets  

In illustration of the way in which the workrooms influence the state of health Dr Simon gives 
the following table of mortality

Chapter  

D Modern Domestic Industry 

I  now  come  to  the  socalled  domestic  industry  In  order  to  get  an  idea  of  the  horrors  of  this 
sphere  in  which  capital  conducts  its  exploitation  in  the  background  of  modern  mechanical 
industry one must go to the apparently quite idyllic trade of nailmaking carried on in a few 
remote villages of England In this place however it will be enough to give a few examples from 
those branches of the lacemaking and strawplaiting industries that are not yet carried on by the 
aid  of  machinery  and  that  as  yet  do  not  compete  with  branches  carried  on  in  factories  or  in 
manufactories  
Of the  persons employed in England in the production of lace about  fall under 
the authority of the Factory Act  Almost the whole of the remaining  are women 
young persons and children of both sexes the male sex however being weakly represented The 
state  of  health  of  this  cheap  material  for  exploitation  will  be  seen  from  the  following  table 
computed by Dr Trueman physician to the Nottingham General Dispensary Out of  female 
patients  who  were  lacemakers  most  of  them  between  the  ages  of    and    the  number  of 
consumptive ones were  
   in     in  
   in     in  
   in     in  
   in     in   
This progress in the rate of consumption ought to suffice for the most optimist of progressists 
and for the biggest hawker of lies among the Freetrade bagmen of Germany  
The Factory Act of  regulates the actual making of the lace so far as it is done by machinery 
and this is the rule in England The branches that we are now about to examine solely with regard 
to  those  of  the  workpeople  who  work  at  home  and  not  those  who  work  in  manufactories  or 
warehouses  fall  into  two  divisions  viz    finishing    mending  The  former  gives  the 
finishing touches to the machinemade lace and includes numerous subdivisions  
The lace finishing is done either in what are called mistresses houses or by women in their 
own houses with or without the help of their children The women who keep the mistresses 
houses  are themselves  poor  The  workroom  is  in  a  private  house The  mistresses  take  orders 
from  manufacturers  or  from  warehousemen  and  employ  as  many  women  girls  and  young 
children as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the business will allow The 
number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms varies from  to  in some and from 
 to  in others The average age at which the children commence work is six years but in 
many cases it is below five The usual workinghours are from  in the morning till eight in the 
evening with  hours for meals which are taken at irregular intervals and often in the foul 
workrooms When business is brisk the labour frequently lasts from  or even  oclock in the 
morning till   or  oclock at night In English barracks the regulation space allotted to 
each soldier is  cubic feet and in the military hospitals  cubic feet But in those 
finishing sties there are but  to  cubic feet to each person At the same time the oxygen of 
the air is consumed by gaslights In order to keep the lace clean and although the floor is tiled or 
gagged the children are often compelled even in winter to pull off their shoes 

It is not at all uncommon in Nottingham to find  to  children huddled 
together in a small room of perhaps not more than  feet square and employed 
for  hours out of the  at work that of itself is exhausting from its weariness 
and monotony and is besides carried on under every possible unwholesome 
condition Even the very youngest children work with a strained attention and a 

 

 

 

Chapter  

rapidity that is astonishing hardly ever giving their fingers rest or glowering their 
motion If a question be asked them they never raise their eyes from their work 
from fear of losing a single moment  

The long stick is used by the mistresses as a stimulant more and more as the working hours are 
prolonged  

The children gradually tire and become as restless as birds towards the end of 
their long detention at an occupation that is monotonous eyestraining and 
exhausting from the uniformity in the posture of the body Their work is like 
slavery  

When women and their children work at home which nowadays means in a hired room often in 
a garret the state of things is if possible still worse This sort of work is given out within a circle 
of  miles radius from Nottingham On leaving the warehouses at  or  oclock at night the 
children are often given a bundle of lace to take home with them and finish The Pharisee of a 
capitalist  represented  by  one  of  his  servants  accompanies  this  action  of  course  with  the 
unctuous phrase Thats for mother yet he knows well enough that the poor children must sit 
up and help  
Pillow lacemaking is chiefly carried on in England in two agricultural districts one the Honiton 
lace district extending from  to  miles along the south coast of Devonshire and including a 
few  places  in  North  Devon  the  other  comprising  a great  part  of the counties of  Buckingham 
Bedford and Northampton and also the adjoining portions of Oxfordshire and Huntingdonshire 
The  cottages  of the  agricultural labourers are  the places  where  the  work  is  usually  carried  on 
Many manufacturers employ upwards of  of these lacemakers who are chiefly children and 
young persons of the female sex exclusively The state of things described as incidental to lace 
finishing is here repeated save that instead of the mistresses houses we find what are called 
laceschools kept by poor women in their cottages From their fifth year and often earlier until 
their twelfth or fifteenth year the children work in these schools during the first year the very 
young ones work from four to eight hours and later on from six in the morning till eight and ten 
oclock at night 

The rooms are generally the ordinary living rooms of small cottages the chimney 
stopped up to keep out draughts the inmates kept warm by their own animal heat 
alone and this frequently in winter In other cases these socalled schoolrooms 
are like small storerooms without fireplaces The overcrowding in these dens 
and the consequent vitiation of the air are often extreme Added to this is the 
injurious effect of drains privies decomposing substances and other filth usual in 
the purlieus of the smaller cottages With regard to space In one laceschool  
girls and a mistress  cubic feet to each person in another where the smell was 
unbearable  persons and  cubic feet per head In this industry are to be 
found employed children of  and  years  

Where lacemaking ends in the counties of Buckingham and Bedford strawplaiting begins and 
extends over a large part of Hertfordshire and the westerly and northerly parts of Essex In  
there were  persons employed in strawplaiting and strawhat making of these  were 
males of all ages the rest females of whom  including about  children were under 
  years  of  age  In  the  place  of  the  laceschools  we  find  here  the  strawplait  schools  The 
children commence their instruction in strawplaiting generally in their th often between their 
rd  and  th  year  Education  of  course  they  get  none  The  children  themselves  call  the 
elementary schools natural schools to distinguish them from these bloodsucking institutions 
in which they are kept at work simply to get through the task generally  yards daily prescribed 
 

 

Chapter  
 
by their halfstarved mothers These same mothers often make them work at home after school is 
over till   and  oclock at night The straw cuts their mouths with which they constantly 
moisten  it  and their  fingers  Dr  Ballard  gives  it as the  general  opinion  of the  whole  body  of 
medical officers in London that  cubic feet is the minimum space proper for each person in a 
bedroom or workroom But in the strawplait schools space is more sparingly allotted than in the 
laceschools     and below  cubic feet for each person  

The smaller of these numbers says one of the commissioners Mr White 
represents less space than the half of what a child would occupy if packed in a box 
measuring  feet in each direction  

Thus do the children enjoy life till the age of  or  The wretched halfstarved parents think of 
nothing but getting as much as possible out of their children The latter as soon as they are grown 
up do not care a farthing and naturally so for their parents and leave them 

It is no wonder that ignorance and vice abound in a population so brought up 
Their morality is at the lowest ebb a great number of the women have 
illegitimate children and that at such an immature age that even those most 
conversant with criminal statistics are astounded  

And the native land of these model families is the pattern Christian country for Europe so says at 
least Count Montalembert certainly a competent authority on Christianity  
Wages in the above industries miserable as they are the maximum wages of a child in the straw
plait schools rising in rare cases to  shillings are reduced far below their nominal amount by the 
prevalence of the truck system everywhere but especially in the lace districts  

E Passage of Modern Manufacture and Domestic 

Industry into Modern Mechanical Industry The Hastening 
of this Revolution by the Application of the Factory Acts to 

those Industries 

The cheapening of labourpower by sheer abuse of the labour of women and children by sheer 
robbery of every normal condition requisite for working and living and by the sheer brutality of 
overwork and nightwork meets at last with natural obstacles that cannot be overstepped So also 
when based on these methods do the cheapening of commodities and capitalist exploitation in 
general So soon as this point is at last reached  and it takes many years  the hour has struck for 
the introduction of machinery and for the thenceforth rapid conversion of the scattered domestic 
industries and also of manufactures into factory industries  
An  example  on  the  most  colossal  scale  of  this  movement  is  afforded  by  the  production  of 
wearing  apparel  This  industry  according  to  the  classification  of  the  Childrens  Employment 
Commission comprises strawhat makers ladieshat makers capmakers tailors milliners and 
dressmakers  shirtmakers  corsetmakers  glovemakers  shoemakers  besides  many  minor 
branches such as the making of neckties collars c In  the number of females employed 
in  these  industries in  England and Wales amounted  to    of these    at  the  least 
were under  and  under  years of age The number of these workwomen in the United 
Kingdom in  was  The number of males employed in England and Wales in hat
making shoemaking glovemaking and tailoring was  of these  under  years 
  between   and   and    over    years  Many  of  the  smaller  branches  are  not 
included in these figures But take the figures as they stand we then have for England and Wales 
alone  according  to  the  census  of    a  total  of    persons  about  as  many  as  are 
absorbed  by  agriculture  and  cattle  breeding  We  begin  to  understand  what  becomes  of  the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
immense quantities of goods conjured up by the magic of machinery and of the enormous masses 
of workpeople which that machinery sets free  
The  production  of  wearing  apparel  is  carried  on  partly  in  manufactories  in  whose  workrooms 
there is but a reproduction of that division of labour the membra disjecta of which were found 
ready to hand partly by small masterhandicraftsmen these however do not as formerly work 
for individual consumers but for manufactories and warehouses and to such an extent that often 
whole  towns  and  stretches  of  country  carry  on  certain  branches  such  as  shoemaking  as  a 
speciality finally on a very great scale by the socalled domestic workers who form an external 
department  of  the  manufactories  warehouses  and  even  of  the  workshops  of  the  smaller 
masters  
The  raw  material  c is supplied  by  mechanical industry  the  mass  of cheap human  material 
taillable    merci  et  misricorde  is  composed  of  the  individuals  liberated  by  mechanical 
industry and improved agriculture The manufactures of this class owed their origin chiefly to the 
capitalists need of having at hand an army ready equipped to meet any increase of demand 
These  manufactures  nevertheless  allowed  the  scattered  handicrafts  and  domestic  industries to 
continue to exist as a broad foundation The great production of surplusvalue in these branches 
of  labour  and  the  progressive  cheapening  of  their  articles  were  and  are  chiefly  due  to  the 
minimum wages paid no more than requisite for a miserable vegetation and to the extension of 
workingtime  up  to  the  maximum  endurable  by  the  human  organism  It  was  in  fact  by  the 
cheapness of the human sweat and the human blood which were converted into commodities 
that  the  markets  were  constantly  being  extended  and  continue  daily  to  be  extended  more 
especially was this the case with Englands colonial markets where besides English tastes and 
habits prevail At last the critical point was reached The basis of the old method sheer brutality 
in  the  exploitation  of  the  workpeople  accompanied  more  or  less  by  a  systematic  division  of 
labour  no  longer  sufficed  for  the  extending  markets  and  for  the  still  more  rapidly  extending 
competition  of  the  capitalists  The  hour  struck  for  the  advent  of  machinery  The  decisively 
revolutionary machine the machine which attacks in an equal degree the whole of the numberless 
branches of this sphere of production dressmaking tailoring shoemaking sewing hatmaking 
and many others is the sewingmachine  
Its  immediate  effect  on  the  workpeople  is  like  that  of  all  machinery  which  since  the  rise  of 
modern industry has seized upon new branches of trade Children of too tender an age are sent 
adrift The wage of the machine hands rises compared with that of the houseworkers many of 
whom belong to the poorest of the poor That of the better situated handicraftsman with whom 
the machine competes sinks The new machine hands are exclusively girls and young women 
With the help of mechanical force they destroy the monopoly that male labour had of the heavier 
work and they drive off from the lighter work numbers of old women and very young children 
The overpowering competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers The fearful increase 
in death from starvation during the last  years in London runs parallel with the extension of 
machine sewing The new workwomen turn the machines by hand and foot or by hand alone 
sometimes  sitting  sometimes  standing  according  to  the  weight  size  and  special  make  of  the 
machine and expend a great deal of labourpower Their occupation is unwholesome owing to 
the long hours although in most cases they are not so long as under the old system Wherever the 
sewingmachine  locates  itself  in  narrow  and  already  overcrowded  workrooms  it  adds  to  the 
unwholesome influences 
The  effect  says  Mr  Lord  on  entering  lowceiled  workrooms  in  which    to    machine 
hands are working is unbearable The heat partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
irons is horrible Even when moderate hours of work ie from  in the morning till  in the 
evening prevail in such places yet  or  persons fall into a swoon regularly every day  
The  revolution in the  industrial  methods  which is the  necessary  result  of the  revolution in the 
instruments  of  production  is  effected  by  a  medley  of  transition  forms  These  forms  vary 
according  to  the  extent  to  which  the  sewingmachine  has  become  prevalent  in  one  branch  of 
industry or the other to the time during which it has been in operation to the previous condition 
of the workpeople to the preponderance of manufacture of handicrafts or of domestic industry 
to the rent of the workrooms c In dressmaking for instance where the labour for the most 
part was already organised chiefly by simple cooperation the sewingmachine at first formed 
merely a new factor in that manufacturing industry In tailoring shirtmaking shoemaking c 
all the forms are intermingled Here the factory system proper There middlemen receive the raw 
material from the capitalist en chef and group around their sewingmachines in chambers and 
garrets from  to  or more workwomen Finally as is always the case with machinery when 
not organised into a system and when it can also be used in dwarfish proportions handicraftsman 
and domestic workers along with their families or with a little extra labour from without make 
use  of  their  own  sewingmachines  The  system  actually  prevalent  in  England  is  that  the 
capitalist  concentrates  a  large  number  of  machines  on  his  premises  and  then  distributes  the 
produce of those machines for further manipulation amongst the domestic workers The variety 
of the transition forms however does not conceal the tendency to conversion into the factory 
system proper This tendency is nurtured by the very nature of the sewingmachine the manifold 
uses  of  which  push  on  the  concentration  under  one roof  and  one  management  of  previously 
separated  branches  of  a  trade  It  is  also  favoured  by  the  circumstance  that  preparatory 
needlework and certain other operations are most conveniently done on the premises where the 
machine  is  at  work  as  well  as  by  the  inevitable  expropriation  of  the  hand  sewers  and  of  the 
domestic  workers  who  work  with  their  own  machines This  fate has already  in  part  overtaken 
them The constantly increasing amount of capital invested in sewingmachines gives the spur 
to the production of and gluts the markets with machinemade articles thereby giving the signal 
to the domestic workers for the sale of their machines The overproduction of sewingmachines 
themselves causes their producers in bad want of a sale to let them out for so much a week thus 
crushing by their deadly competition the small owners of machines Constant changes in the 
construction  of  the  machines  and  their  everincreasing  cheapness  depreciate  day  by  day  the 
older makes and allow of their being sold in great numbers at absurd prices to large capitalists 
who alone can thus employ them at a profit Finally the substitution of the steamengine for man 
gives in this as in all similar revolutions the finishing blow At first the use of steam power 
meets  with  mere  technical  difficulties  such  as  unsteadiness  in  the  machines  difficulty  in 
controlling their speed rapid wear and tear of the lighter machines c all of which are soon 
overcome  by  experience  If  on  the  one  hand  the  concentration  of  many  machines  in  large 
manufactories leads to the use of steam power on the other hand the competition of steam with 
human muscles hastens on the concentration of workpeople and machines in large factories Thus 
England is at present experiencing not only in the colossal industry of making wearing apparel 
but in most of the other trades mentioned above the conversion of manufacture of handicrafts 
and of domestic work into the factory system after each of those forms of production totally 
changed and disorganised under the influence of modern industry has long ago reproduced and 
even overdone all the horrors of the factory system without participating in any of the elements 
of social progress it contains  
This  industrial  revolution  which  takes  place  spontaneously  is  artificially  helped  on  by  the 
extension of the Factory Acts to all industries in which women young persons and children are 

 

 

Chapter  
 
employed The compulsory regulation of the working day as regards its length pauses beginning 
and end the system of relays of children the exclusion of all children under a certain age c 
necessitate on the one hand more machinery and the substitution of steam as a motive power in 
the place of muscles On the other hand in order to make up for the loss of time an expansion 
occurs of the means of production used in common of the furnaces buildings c in one word 
greater  concentration  of  the  means  of  production  and  a  correspondingly  greater  concourse  of 
workpeople  The  chief  objection  repeatedly  and  passionately  urged  on  behalf  of  each 
manufacture threatened with the Factory Act is in fact this that in order to continue the business 
on the old scale a greater outlay of capital will be necessary But as regards labour in the socalled 
domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them and Manufacture so soon as limits 
are put to the working day and to the employment of children those industries go to the wall 
Unlimited exploitation of cheap labourpower is the sole foundation of their power to compete  
One of the essential conditions for the existence of the factory system especially when the length 
of the working day is fixed is certainty in the result ie the production in a given time of a given 
quantity of commodities or of a given useful effect The statutory pauses in the working day 
moreover imply the assumption that periodical and sudden cessation of the work does no harm to 
the article undergoing the process of production This certainty in the result and this possibility 
of interrupting the work are of course easier to be attained in the purely mechanical industries 
than  in  those  in  which  chemical  and  physical  processes  play  a  part  as  for  instance  in  the 
earthenware trade in bleaching dyeing baking and in most of the metal industries Wherever 
there  is  a  workingday  without  restriction  as  to  length  wherever  there  is  nightwork  and 
unrestricted waste of human life there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature of the work 
to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting barrier erected by Nature No 
poison kills vermin with more certainty than the Factory Act removes such everlasting barriers 
No  one  made  a  greater  outcry  over  impossibilities  than  our  friends  the  earthenware 
manufacturers In  however they were brought under the Act and within sixteen months 
every impossibility had vanished 

The improved method called forth by the Act of making slip by pressure 
instead of by evaporation the newlyconstructed stoves for drying the ware in its 
green state c are each events of great importance in the pottery art and mark 
an advance which the preceding century could not rival It has even 
considerably reduced the temperature of the stoves themselves with a considerable 
saving of fuel and with a readier effect on the ware  

In spite of every prophecy the costprice of earthenware did not rise but the quantity produced 
did  and  to  such  an  extent  that  the  export  for  the  twelve  months  ending  December   
exceeded in value by  the average of the preceding three years In the manufacture of 
matches it was thought to be an indispensable requirement that boys even while bolting their 
dinner  should  go  on  dipping  the  matches  in  melted  phosphorus  the  poisonous  vapour  from 
which rose into their faces The Factory Act  made the saving of time a necessity and so 
forced into existence a dipping machine the vapour from which could not come in contact with 
the workers So at the present time in those branches of the lace manufacture not yet subject 
to the Factory Act it is maintained that the mealtimes cannot be regular owing to the different 
periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying which periods vary from three minutes 
up to an hour and more To this the Childrens Employment Commissioners answer 
The circumstances of this case are precisely analogous to that of the paper
stainers dealt with in our first report Some of the principal manufacturers in the 
trade urged that in consequence of the nature of the materials used and their 

 

 

 

Chapter  

various processes they would be unable without serious loss to stop for meal
times at any given moment But it was seen from the evidence that by due care 
and previous arrangement the apprehended difficulty would be got over and 
accordingly by clause  of section  of the Factory Acts Extension Act passed 
during this Session of Parliament an interval of eighteen months is given to them 
from the passing of the Act before they are required to conform to the meal hours 
specified by the Factory Acts  

Hardly had the Act been passed when our friends the manufacturers found out 

The inconveniences we expected to arise from the introduction of the Factory 
Acts into our branch of manufacture I am happy to say have not arisen We do 
not find the production at all interfered with in short we produce more in the 
same time  

It  is  evident that the  English  legislature  which  certainly  no  one  will  venture to  reproach  with 
being  overdosed  with  genius  has  been  led  by  experience  to  the  conclusion  that  a  simple 
compulsory law is sufficient to enact away all the socalled impediments opposed by the nature 
of the process to the restriction and regulation of the working day Hence on the introduction of 
the Factory Act into a given industry a period varying from six to eighteen months is fixed within 
which it is incumbent on the manufacturers to remove all technical impediments to the working 
of the Act Mirabeaus Impossible ne me dites jamais ce bte de mot is particularly applicable 
to modern technology But though the Factory Acts thus artificially ripen the material elements 
necessary for the conversion of the manufacturing system into the factory system yet at the same 
time owing to the necessity they impose for greater outlay of capital they hasten on the decline 
of the small masters and the concentration of capital  
Besides the purely technical impediments that are removable by technical means the irregular 
habits  of  the  workpeople  themselves  obstruct  the  regulation  of  the  hours  of  labour  This  is 
especially the case where piecewage predominates and where loss of time in one part of the day 
or week can be made good by subsequent overtime or by nightwork a process which brutalises 
the adult workman and ruins his wife and children Although this absence of regularity in the 
expenditure  of  labourpower  is  a  natural  and  rude  reaction  against  the  tedium  of  monotonous 
drudgery it originates also to a much greater degree from anarchy in production anarchy that in 
its turn presupposes unbridled exploitation of labourpower by the capitalist Besides the general 
periodic changes of the industrial cycle and the special fluctuations in the markets to which each 
industry  is  subject  we  may  also  reckon  what  is  called  the  season  dependent  either  on  the 
periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for navigation or on fashion and the sudden placing 
of large orders that have to be executed in the shortest possible time The habit of giving such 
orders becomes more frequent with the extension of railways and telegraphs 

The extension of the railway system throughout the country has tended very 
much to encourage giving short notice Purchasers now come up from Glasgow 
Manchester and Edinburgh once every fortnight or so to the wholesale city 
warehouses which we supply and give small orders requiring immediate 
execution instead of buying from stock as they used to do Years ago we were 
always able to work in the slack times so as to meet demand of the next season 
but now no one can say beforehand what will be the demand then  

In those factories and manufactories that are not yet subject to the Factory Acts the most fearful 
overwork  prevails  periodically  during  what  is  called  the  season  in  consequence  of  sudden 
 

 

Chapter  
 
orders In the outside department of the factory of the manufactory and of the warehouse the so
called domestic workers whose employment is at the best irregular are entirely dependent for 
their raw material and their orders on the caprice of the capitalist who in this industry is not 
hampered by any regard for depreciation of his buildings and machinery and risks nothing by a 
stoppage of work but the skin of the worker himself Here then he sets himself systematically to 
work to form an industrial reserve force that shall be ready at a moments notice during one part 
of the year he decimates this force by the most inhuman toil during the other part he lets it starve 
for want of work  

The employers avail themselves of the habitual irregularity in the homework 
when any extra work is wanted at a push so that the work goes on till  and  
pm or  am or as the usual phrase is all hours and that in localities where 
the stench is enough to knock you down you go to the door perhaps and open 
it but shudder to go further They are curious men said one of the 
witnesses a shoemaker speaking of the masters they think it does a boy no 
harm to work too hard for half the year if he is nearly idle for the other half  

In  the  same  way  as  technical impediments  so  too  those  usages  which  have  grown  with the 
growth of trade were and still are proclaimed by interested capitalists as obstacles due to the 
nature  of  the  work  This  was  a  favourite  cry  of  the  cotton  lords  at  the  time  they  were  first 
threatened  with  the  Factory  Acts  Although  their  industry  more  than  any  other  depends  on 
navigation  yet  experience  has  given  them  the  lie  Since  then  every  pretended  obstruction  to 
business  has  been  treated  by  the  Factory  inspectors  as  a  mere  sham  The  thoroughly 
conscientious investigations of the Childrens Employment Commission prove that the effect of 
the  regulation  of  the  hours  of  work  in  some  industries  was  to  spread  the  mass  of  labour 
previously employed more evenly over the whole year  that this regulation was the first rational 
bridle on the murderous meaningless caprices of fashion caprices that consort so badly with 
the system of modern industry that the development of ocean navigation and of the means of 
communication generally has swept away the technical basis on which seasonwork was really 
supported and that all other socalled unconquerable difficulties vanish before larger buildings 
additional  machinery  increase  in  the  number  of  workpeople  employed  and  the  alterations 
caused by all these in the mode of conducting the wholesale trade But for all that capital never 
becomes  reconciled  to  such  changes    and  this  is  admitted  over  and  over  again  by  its  own 
representatives    except  under  the  pressure  of  a  General  Act  of  Parliament  for  the 
compulsory regulation of the hours of labour  
Section  The Factory Acts Sanitary and Educational Clauses 

of the same Their General Extension in England 

Factory  legislation  that  first  conscious  and  methodical  reaction  of  society  against  the 
spontaneously developed form of the process of production is as we have seen just as much the 
necessary  product  of  modern  industry  as  cotton  yarn  selfactors  and  the  electric  telegraph 
Before  passing  to  the  consideration  of  the  extension  of  that  legislation  in  England  we  shall 
shortly notice certain clauses contained in the Factory Acts and not relating to the hours of work  
Apart  from  their  wording  which  makes  it  easy  for  the  capitalist  to  evade  them  the  sanitary 
clauses are extremely meagre and in fact limited to provisions for whitewashing the walls for 
insuring cleanliness in some other matters for ventilation and for protection against dangerous 
machinery In the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of the masters to 
those  clauses  which  imposed  upon  them  a  slight  expenditure  on  appliances  for  protecting  the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
limbs of their workpeople an opposition that throws a fresh and glaring light on the Freetrade 
dogma  according  to  which  in  a  society  with  conflicting  interests  each  individual  necessarily 
furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantage One example is 
enough The reader knows that during the last  years the flax industry has very much extended 
and  that  with  that  extension  the  number  of  scutching  mills  in  Ireland  has  increased  In   
there  were  in  that  country    of  these  mills  Regularly  in  autumn  and  winter  women  and 
young persons the wives sons and daughters of the neighbouring small farmers a class of 
people totally unaccustomed to machinery are taken from field labour to feed the rollers of the 
scutching  mills  with  flax  The  accidents  both  as  regards  number  and  kind  are  wholly 
unexampled  in  the  history  of  machinery  In  one  scutching  mill  at  Kildinan  near  Cork  there 
occurred between  and  six fatal accidents and sixty mutilations every one of which 
might  have  been  prevented  by  the  simplest  appliances  at  the  cost  of  a  few  shillings  Dr  W 
White the certifying surgeon for factories at Downpatrick states in his official report dated the 
th December  

The serious accidents at the scutching mills are of the most fearful nature In 
many cases a quarter of the body is torn from the trunk and either involves death 
or a future of wretched incapacity and suffering The increase of mills in the 
country will of course extend these dreadful results and it will be a great boon if 
they are brought under the legislature I am convinced that by proper supervision 
of scutching mills a vast sacrifice of life and limb would be averted  

What  could  possibly  show  better  the  character  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  than  the 
necessity  that  exists  for  forcing  upon  it  by  Acts  of  Parliament  the  simplest  appliances  for 
maintaining cleanliness and health In the potteries the Factory Act of  has whitewashed 
and cleansed upwards of  workshops after a period of abstinence from any such cleaning in 
many cases of  years and in some entirely this is the abstinence of the capitalist in 
which were employed  artisans hitherto breathing through protracted days and often nights 
of  labour  a  mephitic  atmosphere  and  which  rendered  an  otherwise  comparatively  innocuous 
occupation pregnant with disease and death The Act has improved the ventilation very much 
At the same time this portion of the Act strikingly shows that the capitalist mode of production 
owing to its very nature excludes all rational improvement beyond a certain point It has been 
stated over and over again that the English doctors are unanimous in declaring that where the 
work is continuous  cubic feet is the very least space that should be allowed for each person 
Now  if  the  Factory  Acts  owing  to  their  compulsory  provisions  indirectly  hasten  on  the 
conversion of small workshops into factories thus indirectly attacking the proprietary rights of 
the smaller capitalists and assuring a monopoly to the great ones so if it were made obligatory 
to provide the proper space for each workman in every workshop thousands of small employers 
would  at  one  full  swoop  be  expropriated  directly  The  very  root  of  the  capitalist  mode  of 
production ie the selfexpansion of all capital large or small by means of the free purchase 
and consumption of labourpower would be attacked Factory legislation is therefore brought to a 
deadlock  before  these    cubic  feet  of  breathing  space  The  sanitary  officers  the  industrial 
inquiry commissioners the factory inspectors all harp over and over again upon the necessity 
for those  cubic feet and upon the impossibility of wringing them out of capital They thus in 
fact  declare  that  consumption  and  other  lung  diseases  among  the  workpeople  are  necessary 
conditions to the existence of capital  
Paltry  as  the  education  clauses  of  the  Act  appear  on  the  whole  yet  they  proclaim  elementary 
education to be an indispensable condition to the employment of children The success of those 
clauses proved for the first time the possibility of combining education and gymnastics with 
 

Chapter  
 
manual labour and consequently of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics 
The factory inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters that the factory children 
although  receiving  only  one  half  the  education  of  the  regular  day  scholars  yet  learnt  quite  as 
much and often more 

 

This can be accounted for by the simple fact that with only being at school for 
one half of the day they are always fresh and nearly always ready and willing to 
receive instruction The system on which they work half manual labour and half 
school renders each employment a rest and a relief to the other consequently 
both are far more congenial to the child than would be the case were he kept 
constantly at one It is quite clear that a boy who has been at school all the 
morning cannot in hot weather particularly cope with one who comes fresh and 
bright from his work  

Further information on this point will be found in Seniors speech at the Social Science Congress 
at Edinburgh in  He there shows amongst other things how the monotonous and uselessly 
long school hours of the children of the upper and middle classes uselessly add to the labour of 
the teacher while he not only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously wastes the time health and 
energy of the children From the Factory system budded as Robert Owen has shown us in 
detail the germ of the education of the future an education that will in the case of every child 
over a given age combine productive labour with instruction and gymnastics not only as one of 
the methods of adding to the efficiency of production but as the only method of producing fully 
developed human beings  
Modern industry as we have seen sweeps away by technical means the manufacturing division 
of labour under which each man is bound hand and foot for life to a single detailoperation At 
the same time the capitalistic form of that industry reproduces this same division of labour in a 
still  more  monstrous  shape  in  the  factory  proper  by  converting  the  workman  into  a  living 
appendage  of  the  machine  and  everywhere  outside  the  Factory  partly  by  the  sporadic  use  of 
machinery  and  machine  workers  partly  by  reestablishing  the  division  of  labour  on  a  fresh 
basis by the general introduction of the labour of women and children and of cheap unskilled 
labour  
The  antagonism  between  the  manufacturing  division  of  labour  and  the  methods  of  modern 
industry makes itself forcibly felt It manifests itself amongst other ways in the frightful fact that 
a great part of the children employed in modern factories and manufactures are from their earliest 
years riveted to the most simple manipulations and exploited for years without being taught a 
single sort of work that would afterwards make them of use even in the same manufactory or 
factory In the English letterpress printing trade for example there existed formerly a system 
corresponding to that in the old manufactures and handicrafts of advancing the apprentices from 
easy  to  more  and  more  difficult  work  They  went  through  a  course  of  teaching  till  they  were 
finished printers To be able to read and write was for every one of them a requirement of their 
trade All this was changed by the printing machine It employs two sorts of labourers one grown 
up renters the other boys mostly from  to  years of age whose sole business is either to 
spread the sheets of paper under the machine or to take from it the printed sheets They perform 
this weary task in London especially for   and  hours at a stretch during several days in 
the week and frequently for  hours with only  hours rest for meals and sleep A great part 
of them cannot read and they are as a rule utter savages and very extraordinary creatures 

To qualify them for the work which they have to do they require no intellectual 
training there is little room in it for skill and less for judgment their wages 
though rather high for boys do not increase proportionately as they grow up and 

 

 

 

Chapter  

the majority of them cannot look for advancement to the better paid and more 
responsible post of machine minder because while each machine has but one 
minder it has at least two and often four boys attached to it  

As  soon  as  they  get  too  old  for  such  childs  work  that  is  about    at  the  latest  they  are 
discharged from the printing establishments They become recruits of crime Several attempts to 
procure them employment elsewhere were rendered of no avail by their ignorance and brutality 
and by their mental and bodily degradation  
As with the division of labour in the interior of the manufacturing workshops so it is with the 
division  of  labour  in  the  interior  of  society  So  long  as  handicraft  and  manufacture  form  the 
general  groundwork  of  social  production  the  subjection  of  the  producer  to  one  branch 
exclusively the breaking up of the multifariousness of his employment is a necessary step in 
the development On that groundwork each separate branch of production acquires empirically 
the  form  that  is  technically  suited  to  it  slowly  perfects  it  and  so  soon  as  a  given  degree  of 
maturity  has  been  reached  rapidly  crystallises  that  form  The  only  thing  that  here  and  there 
causes a change besides new raw material supplied by commerce is the gradual alteration of the 
instruments of labour But their form too once definitely settled by experience petrifies as is 
proved by their being in many cases handed down in the same form by one generation to another 
during thousands of years A characteristic feature is that even down into the eighteenth century 
the different trades were called mysteries mystres into their secrets none but those duly 
initiated could penetrate modern industry rent the veil that concealed from men their own social 
process of production and that turned the various spontaneously divided branches of production 
into  so  many  riddles  not  only  to  outsiders  but  even  to  the  initiated  The  principle  which  it 
pursued  of resolving  each  process  into its  constituent  movements  without  any  regard  to  their 
possible  execution  by  the  hand  of  man  created  the  new  modern  science  of  technology  The 
varied  apparently  unconnected  and  petrified  forms  of  the  industrial  processes  now  resolved 
themselves  into  so  many  conscious  and  systematic  applications  of  natural  science  to  the 
attainment of given useful effects Technology also discovered the few main fundamental forms 
of motion which despite the diversity of the instruments used are necessarily taken by every 
productive  action  of  the  human  body  just  as  the  science  of  mechanics  sees  in  the  most 
complicated machinery nothing but the continual repetition of the simple mechanical powers  
Modern industry never looks upon and treats the existing form of a process as final The technical 
basis  of  that  industry  is  therefore  revolutionary  while  all  earlier  modes  of  production  were 
essentially conservative By means of machinery chemical processes and other methods it is 
continually causing changes not only in the technical basis of production but also in the functions 
of the labourer and in the social combinations of the labourprocess At the same time it thereby 
also revolutionises the division of labour within the society and incessantly launches masses of 
capital and of workpeople from one branch of production to another But if modern industry by 
its very nature therefore necessitates variation of labour fluency of function universal mobility 
of the labourer on the other hand in its capitalistic form it reproduces the old division of labour 
with  its  ossified  particularisations  We  have  seen  how  this  absolute  contradiction  between  the 
technical necessities of modern industry and the social character inherent in its capitalistic form 
dispels  all  fixity  and  security  in  the  situation  of  the  labourer  how  it  constantly  threatens  by 
taking away the instruments of labour to snatch from his hands his means of subsistence and 
by  suppressing  his  detailfunction  to  make  him  superfluous  We  have  seen  too  how  this 
antagonism vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity an industrial reserve army kept in 
misery in order to be always at the disposal of capital in the incessant human sacrifices from 
among  the  workingclass  in  the  most  reckless  squandering  of  labourpower  and  in  the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
devastation  caused  by  a  social  anarchy  which  turns  every  economic  progress  into  a  social 
calamity This is the negative side But if on the one hand variation of work at present imposes 
itself after the manner of an overpowering natural law and with the blindly destructive action of a 
natural law that meets with resistance at all points modern industry on the other hand through 
its  catastrophes  imposes  the  necessity  of  recognising  as  a  fundamental  law  of  production 
variation of work consequently fitness of the labourer for varied work consequently the greatest 
possible development of his varied aptitudes It becomes a question of life and death for society 
to adapt the mode of production to the normal functioning of this law Modern Industry indeed 
compels society under penalty of death to replace the detailworker of today grappled by life
long repetition of one and the same trivial operation and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a 
man by the fully developed individual fit for a variety of labours ready to face any change of 
production and to whom the different social functions he performs are but so many modes of 
giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers 
One  step already  spontaneously  taken towards  effecting  this revolution  is  the  establishment  of 
technical and agricultural schools and  of  coles  denseignement  professionnel in  which the 
children  of  the  workingmen  receive  some  little  instruction  in  technology  and  in  the  practical 
handling  of  the  various  implements  of  labour  Though  the  Factory  Act  that  first  and  meagre 
concession wrung from capital is limited to combining elementary education with work in the 
factory  there  can  be  no doubt that  when  the  workingclass  comes  into  power  as inevitably it 
must  technical  instruction  both  theoretical  and  practical  will  take  its  proper  place  in  the 
workingclass schools There is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments the final result of 
which is the abolition of the old division of labour are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic 
form of production and to the economic status of the labourer corresponding to that form But the 
historical development of the antagonisms immanent in a given form of production is the only 
way in which that form of production can be dissolved and a new form established Ne sutor 
ultra  crepidam    this  nec  plus  ultra  of  handicraft  wisdom  became  sheer  nonsense  from  the 
moment the watchmaker Watt invented the steamengine the barber Arkwright the throstle and 
the workingjeweller Fulton the steamship  
So long as Factory legislation is confined to regulating the labour in factories manufactories c 
it is regarded as a mere interference with the exploiting rights of capital But when it comes to 
regulating the socalled homelabour it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria 
potestas  on  parental  authority  The  tenderhearted  English  Parliament  long  affected  to  shrink 
from  taking  this  step  The  force  of  facts  however  compelled  it  at  last  to  acknowledge  that 
modern  industry  in  overturning  the  economic  foundation  on  which  was  based  the  traditional 
family and the family labour corresponding to it had also unloosened all traditional family ties 
The rights  of  the children had  to  be  proclaimed  The  final  report  of  the  Ch  Empl  Comm  of 
 states 

It is unhappily to a painful degree apparent throughout the whole of the 
evidence that against no persons do the children of both sexes so much require 
protection as against their parents The system of unlimited exploitation of 
childrens labour in general and the socalled homelabour in particular is 
maintained only because the parents are able without check or control to 
exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power over their young and tender 
offspring Parents must not possess the absolute power of making their children 
mere machines to earn so much weekly wage The children and young 
persons therefore in all such cases may justifiably claim from the legislature as a 
natural right that an exemption should be secured to them from what destroys 

 

 

 

Chapter  

prematurely their physical strength and lowers them in the scale of intellectual 
and moral beings  

It  was  not  however  the  misuse  of  parental  authority  that  created  the  capitalistic  exploitation 
whether direct or indirect of childrens labour but on the contrary it was the capitalistic mode 
of  exploitation  which  by  sweeping  away  the  economic  basis  of  parental  authority  made  its 
exercise  degenerate  into  a  mischievous  misuse  of  power  However  terrible  and  disgusting  the 
dissolution under the capitalist system of the old family ties may appear nevertheless modern 
industry  by  assigning  as  it  does  an  important  part  in  the  process  of  production  outside  the 
domestic  sphere  to  women  to  young  persons  and  to  children  of  both  sexes  creates  a  new 
economic foundation for a higher form of the family and of the relations between the sexes It is 
of course just as absurd to hold the TeutonicChristian form of the family to be absolute and final 
as it would be to apply that character to the ancient Roman the ancient Greek or the Eastern 
forms which moreover taken together form a series in historical development Moreover it is 
obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes 
and  all  ages  must  necessarily  under  suitable  conditions  become  a  source  of  humane 
development  although  in  its  spontaneously  developed  brutal  capitalistic  form  where  the 
labourer exists for the process of production and not the process of production for the labourer 
that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery  
The necessity for a generalisation of the Factory Acts for transforming them from an exceptional 
law relating to mechanical spinning and weaving  those first creations of machinery  into a law 
affecting social production as a whole arose as we have seen from the mode in which modern 
industry  was  historically  developed  In  the  rear  of  that  industry  the  traditional  form  of 
manufacture of handicraft and of domestic industry is entirely revolutionised manufactures are 
constantly  passing  into  the  factory  system  and  handicrafts  into  manufactures  and  lastly  the 
spheres  of  handicraft  and  of  the  domestic  industries  become  in  a  comparatively  speaking 
wonderfully short time dens of misery in which capitalistic exploitation obtains free play for the 
wildest  excesses  There  are  two  circumstances  that  finally  turn  the  scale  first  the  constantly 
recurring experience that capital so soon as it finds itself subject to legal control at one point 
compensates itself all the more recklessly at other points secondly the cry of the capitalists for 
equality in the conditions of competition ie for equal restrain on all exploitation of labour 
On this point let us listen to two heartbroken cries Messrs Cooksley of Bristol nail and chain 
c  manufacturers  spontaneously  introduced  the  regulations  of  the  Factory  Act  into  their 
business 

As the old irregular system prevails in neighbouring works the Messrs Cooksley 
are subject to the disadvantage of having their boys enticed to continue their 
labour elsewhere after  pm This they naturally say is an unjustice and loss to 
us as it exhausts a portion of the boys strength of which we ought to have the 
full benefit  

Mr J Simpson paper box and bagmaker London states before the commissioners of the Ch 
Empl Comm 

He would sign any petition for it legislative interference As it was he 
always felt restless at night when he had closed his place lest others should be 
working later than him and getting away his orders  

Summarising the Ch Empl Comm says 

It would be unjust to the larger employers that their factories should be placed 
under regulation while the hours of labour in the smaller places in their own 

 

 

 

Chapter  

branch of business were under no legislative restriction And to the injustice 
arising from the unfair conditions of competition in regard to hours that would be 
created if the smaller places of work were exempt would be added the 
disadvantage to the larger manufacturers of finding their supply of juvenile and 
female labour drawn off to the places of work exempt from legislation Further a 
stimulus would be given to the multiplication of the smaller places of work which 
are almost invariably the least favourable to the health comfort education and 
general improvement of the people  

In its final report the Commission proposes to subject to the Factory Act more than  
children  young  persons  and  women  of  which  number  about  one  half  are  exploited  in  small 
industries and by the socalled homework  It says 

But if it should seem fit to Parliament to place the whole of that large number of 
children young persons and females under the protective legislation above 
adverted to  it cannot be doubted that such legislation would have a most 
beneficent effect not only upon the young and the feeble who are its more 
immediate objects but upon the still larger body of adult workers who would in 
all these employments both directly and indirectly come immediately under its 
influence It would enforce upon them regular and moderate hours it would lead 
to their places of work being kept in a healthy and cleanly state it would therefore 
husband and improve that store of physical strength on which their own well
being and that of the country so much depends it would save the rising generation 
from that overexertion at an early age which undermines their constitutions and 
leads to premature decay finally it would ensure them  at least up to the age of 
  the opportunity of receiving the elements of education and would put an end 
to that utter ignorance  so faithfully exhibited in the Reports of our Assistant 
Commissioners and which cannot be regarded without the deepest pain and a 
profound sense of national degradation  

The Tory Cabinet announced in the Speech from the Throne on February   that it had 
framed the proposals of the Industrial Commission of Inquiry into Bills To get that far another 
twenty years of experimentum in corpore vili had been required Already in  a Parliamentary 
Commission  of  Inquiry  on  the  labour  of  children  had  been  appointed  Its  Report  in   
unfolded in the words of Nassau W Senior 

the most frightful picture of avarice selfishness and cruelty on the part of 
masters and of parents and of juvenile and infantile misery degradation and 
destruction ever presented It may be supposed that it describes the horrors of a 
past age But there is unhappily evidence that those horrors continue as intense as 
they were A pamphlet published by Hardwicke about  years ago states that the 
abuses complained of in  are in full bloom at the present day It is a strange 
proof of the general neglect of the morals and health of the children of the 
workingclass that this report lay unnoticed for  years during which the 
children bred up without the remotest sign of comprehension as to what is meant 
by the term morals who had neither knowledge nor religion nor natural 
affection were allowed to become the parents of the present generation  

The  social  conditions  having  undergone  a  change  Parliament  could  not  venture  to  shelve  the 
demands of the Commission of  as it had done those of the Commission of  Hence in 
 when the Commission had not yet published more than a part of its reports the earthenware 
industries including the potteries makers of paperhangings matches cartridges and caps and 
 

 

Chapter  
 
fustian cutters were made subject to the Acts in force in the textile industries In the Speech from 
the Throne on th February  the Tory Cabinet of the day announced the introduction of 
Bills founded on the final recommendations of the Commission which had completed its labours 
in   
On  the  th  August    the  Factory  Acts  Extension  Act  and  on  the  st  August  the 
Workshops Regulation Act received the Royal Assent the former Act having reference to large 
industries the latter to small  
The  former  applies  to  blastfurnaces  iron  and  copper  mills  foundries  machine  shops  metal 
manufactories guttapercha works paper mills glassworks tobacco manufactories letterpress 
printing  including  newspapers  bookbinding  in  short  to  all  industrial  establishments  of  the 
above kind in which  individuals or more are occupied simultaneously and for not less than 
 days during the year  
To give an idea of the extent of the sphere embraced by the Workshops Regulation Act in its 
application we cite from its interpretation clause the following passages 

Handicraft shall mean any manual labour exercised by way of trade or for 
purposes of gain in or incidental to the making any article or part of an article or 
in or incidental to the altering repairing ornamenting finishing or otherwise 
adapting for sale any article  
Workshop shall mean any room or place whatever in the open air or undercover 
in which any handicraft is carried on by any child young person or woman and 
to which and over which the person by whom such child young person or woman 
is employed has the right of access and control  
Employed shall mean occupied in any handicraft whether for wages or not 
under a master or under a parent as herein defined  
Parent shall mean parent guardian or person having the custody of or control 
over any child or young person  

Clause    which  imposes  a  penalty  for  employment  of  children  young  persons  and  women 
contrary to the provisions of the Act subjects to fines not only the occupier of the workshop 
whether parent or not but even 

the parent of or the person deriving any direct benefit from the labour of or 
having the control over the child young person or woman  

The  Factory  Acts  Extension  Act  which  affects  the  large  establishments  derogates  from  the 
Factory Act by a crowd of vicious exceptions and cowardly compromises with the masters  
The Workshops Regulation Act wretched in all its details remained a dead letter in the hands of 
the  municipal  and  local  authorities  who  were  charged  with  its  execution  When  in   
Parliament  withdrew from  them  this  power  in  order  to confer  it  on  the  Factory  Inspectors to 
whose province it thus added by a single stroke more than one hundred thousand workshops and 
three hundred brickworks care was taken at the same time not to add more than eight assistants to 
their already undermanned staff  
What  strikes  us  then  in  the  English  legislation  of    is  on  the  one  hand  the  necessity 
imposed  on  the  parliament  of  the  ruling  classes  of  adopting  in  principle  measures  so 
extraordinary and on so great a scale against the excesses of capitalistic exploitation and on the 
other hand the hesitation the repugnance and the bad faith with which it lent itself to the task of 
carrying those measures into practice  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  Inquiry  Commission  of    also  proposed  a  new  regulation  of  the  mining  industry  an 
industry distinguished from others by the exceptional characteristic that the interests of landlord 
and  capitalist  there  join  hands  The  antagonism  of  these  two  interests  had  been  favourable  to 
Factory legislation while on the other hand the absence of that antagonism is sufficient to explain 
the delays and chicanery of the legislation on mines  
The Inquiry Commission of  had made revelations so terrible so shocking and creating such 
a scandal all over Europe that to salve its conscience Parliament passed the Mining Act of  
in which it limited itself to forbidding the employment underground in mines of children under  
years of age and females  
Then another Act The Mines Inspecting Act of  provides that mines shall be inspected by 
public officers nominated specially for that purpose and that boys between the ages of  and  
years shall not be employed unless they have a school certificate or go to school for a certain 
number of hours This Act was a complete dead letter owing to the ridiculously small number of 
inspectors  the  meagreness  of  their  powers  and  other  causes  that  will  become  apparent  as  we 
proceed  
One of the most recent Blue books on mines is the Report from the Select Committee on Mines 
together  with  c  Evidence  rd  July    This  Report  is  the  work  of  a  Parliamentary 
Committee selected from members of the House of Commons and authorised to summon and 
examine witnesses It is a thick folio volume in which the Report itself occupies only five lines to 
this effect that the committee has nothing to say and that more witnesses must be examined  
The  mode  of  examining  the  witnesses  reminds  one  of  the  crossexamination  of  witnesses  in 
English courts of justice where the advocate tries by means of impudent unexpected equivocal 
and involved questions put without connexion to intimidate surprise and confound the witness 
and to give a forced meaning to the answers extorted from him In this inquiry the members of the 
committee  themselves  are  the  crossexaminers  and  among  them  are  to  be  found  both  mine
owners and mine exploiters the witnesses are mostly working coal miners The whole farce is too 
characteristic of the spirit of capital not to call for a few extracts from this Report For the sake of 
conciseness  I  have  classified  them  I  may  also  add  that  every  question  and  its  answer  are 
numbered in the English Blue books  
 Employment in mines of boys of  years and upwards  In the mines the work inclusive 
of going and returning usually lasts  or  hours sometimes even from   and  oclock am 
till  and  oclock pm n    The adults work in two shifts of eight hours each but 
there is no alternation with the boys on account of the expense n    The younger 
boys are chiefly employed in opening and shutting the ventilating doors in the various parts of the 
mine the older ones are employed on heavier work in carrying coal c n    
They  work  these  long  hours  underground  until  their  th  or  nd  year  when  they  are  put  to 
miners  work  proper  n    Children  and  young  persons  are  at  present  worse  treated  and 
harder  worked  than  at  any  previous  period  n    The  miners  demand  almost 
unanimously an act of Parliament prohibiting the employment in mines of children under  And 
now Hussey Vivian himself an exploiter of mines asks 

Would not the opinion of the workman depend upon the poverty of the 
workmans family Mr Bruce Do you not think it would be a very hard case 
where a parent had been injured or where he was sickly or where a father was 
dead and there was only a mother to prevent a child between  and  earning 
s d a day for the good of the family  You must lay down a general rule  
Are you prepared to recommend legislation which would prevent the employment 
of children under  and  whatever the state of their parents might be Yes 

 

 

 

Chapter  

ns  Vivian Supposing that an enactment were passed preventing the 
employment of children under the age of  would it not be probable that  the 
parents of children would seek employment for their children in other directions 
for instance in manufacture Not generally I think n  Kinnaird Some 
of the boys are keepers of doors Yes Is there not generally a very great 
draught every time you open a door or close it Yes generally there is It 
sounds a very easy thing but it is in fact rather a painful one He is imprisoned 
there just the same as if he was in a cell of a gaol Bourgeois Vivian Whenever 
a boy is furnished with a lamp cannot he read Yes he can read if he finds 
himself in candles I suppose he would be found fault with if he were discovered 
reading he is there to mind his business he has a duty to perform and he has to 
attend to it in the first place and I do not think it would be allowed down the pit 
ns       

II Education  The working miners want a law for the compulsory education of their children 
as in factories They declare the clauses of the Act of  which require a school certificate to 
be  obtained  before  employing  boys  of    and    years  of  age  to  be  quite  illusory  The 
examination of the witnesses on this subject is truly droll 

Is it the Act required more against the masters or against the parents It is 
required against both I think You cannot say whether it is required against one 
more than against the other No I can hardly answer that question ns  
 Does there appear to be any desire on the part of the employers that the 
boys should have such hours as to enable them to go to school No the hours 
are never shortened for that purpose n  Mr Kinnaird Should you say that 
the colliers generally improve their education have you any instances of men who 
have since they began to work greatly improved their education or do they not 
rather go back and lose any advantage that they may have gained They 
generally become worse they do not improve they acquire bad habits they get on 
to drinking and gambling and such like and they go completely to wreck n 
 Do they make any attempt of the kind for providing instruction by having 
schools at night There are few collieries where night schools are held and 
perhaps at those collieries a few boys do go to those schools but they are so 
physically exhausted that it is to no purpose that they go there n  You are 
then concludes the bourgeois against education Most certainly not but 
c n  But are they the employers not compelled to demand them 
school certificates By law they are but I am not aware that they are 
demanded by the employers Then it is your opinion that this provision of the 
Act as to requiring certificates is not generally carried out in the collieries It is 
not carried out ns   Do the men take a great interest in this question 
of education The majority of them do n  Are they very anxious to 
see the law enforced The majority are n  Do you think that in this 
country any law that you pass  can really be effectual unless the population 
themselves assist in putting it into operation Many a man might wish to object 
to employing a boy but he would perhaps become marked by it n  
Marked by whom By his employers n  Do you think that the 
employers would find any fault with a man who obeyed the law  I believe 
they would n  Have you ever heard of any workman objecting to employ 
a boy between  and  who could not write or read It is not left to mens 

 

 

 

Chapter  

option n  Would you call for the interference of Parliament I think 
that if anything effectual is to be done in the education of the colliers children it 
will have to be made compulsory by Act of Parliament n  Would you 
lay that obligation upon the colliers only or all the workpeople of Great Britain 
I came to speak for the colliers n  Why should you distinguish them 
colliery boys from other boys Because I think they are an exception to the 
rule n  In what respect In a physical respect n  Why 
should education be more valuable to them than to other classes of lads I do 
not know that it is more valuable but through the overexertion in mines there is 
less chance for the boys that are employed there to get education either at Sunday 
schools or at day schools n  It is impossible to look at a question of this 
sort absolutely by itself n  Is there a sufficiency of schools  No 
n  If the State were to require that every child should be sent to school 
would there be schools for the children to go to No but I think if the 
circumstances were to spring up the schools would be forthcoming n  
Some of them the boys cannot read and write at all I suppose The majority 
cannot The majority of the men themselves cannot ns    

III Employment of women  Since  women are no more employed underground but are 
occupied on the surface in loading the coal c in drawing the tubs to the canals and railway 
waggons in sorting c Their numbers have considerably increased during the last three or four 
years n  They are mostly the wives daughters and widows of the working miners and 
their ages range from  to  or  years ns   

What is the feeling among the working miners as to the employment of women 
I think they generally condemn it n  What objection do you see to it 
I think it is degrading to the sex n  There is a peculiarity of dress 
Yes  it is rather a mans dress and I believe in some cases it drowns all sense 
of decency Do the women smoke Some do And I suppose it is very dirty 
work Very dirty They get black and grimy As black as those who are 
down the mines  I believe that a woman having children and there are plenty on 
the banks that have cannot do her duty to her children ns   Do 
you think that those widows could get employment anywhere else which would 
bring them in as much wages as that from s to s a week I cannot speak 
to that n  You would still be prepared would you flinthearted 
fellow to prevent their obtaining a livelihood by these means I would n 
 What is the general feeling in the district  as to the employment of 
women The feeling is that it is degrading and we wish as miners to have more 
respect to the fair sex than to see them placed on the pit bank Some part of the 
work is very hard some of these girls have raised as much as  tons of stuff a 
day ns  Do you think that the women employed about the 
collieries are less moral than the women employed in the factories  the 
percentage of bad ones may be a little more  than with the girls in the factories 
n  But you are not quite satisfied with the state of morality in the 
factories No n  Would you prohibit the employment of women in 
factories also No I would not n  Why not I think it a more 
honourable occupation for them in the mills n  Still it is injurious to 
their morality you think Not so much as working on the pit bank but it is 
more on the social position I take it I do not take it on its moral ground alone The 

 

 

 

Chapter  

degradation in its social bearing on the girls is deplorable in the extreme When 
these  or  girls become colliers wives the men suffer greatly from this 
degradation and it causes them to leave their homes and drink n  You 
would be obliged to stop the employment of women in the ironworks as well 
would you not if you stopped it in the collieries I cannot speak for any other 
trade n  Can you see any difference in the circumstances of women 
employed in ironworks and the circumstances of women employed above ground 
in collieries I have not ascertained anything as to that n  Can you see 
anything that makes a distinction between one class and the other I have not 
ascertained that but I know from house to house visitation that it is a deplorable 
state of things in our district n  Would you interfere in every case 
with the employment of women where that employment was degrading It 
would become injurious I think in this way the best feelings of Englishmen have 
been gained from the instruction of a mother  n  That equally applies 
to agricultural employments does it not Yes but that is only for two seasons 
and we have work all the four seasons n  They often work day and 
night wet through to the skin their constitution undermined and their health 
ruined You have not inquired into that subject perhaps I have certainly 
taken note of it as I have gone along and certainly I have seen nothing parallel to 
the effects of the employment of women on the pit bank It is the work of a 
man a strong man ns    Your feeling upon the whole 
subject is that the better class of colliers who desire to raise themselves and 
humanise themselves instead of deriving help from the women are pulled down 
by them Yes n  After some further crooked questions from these 
bourgeois the secret of their sympathy for widows poor families c comes 
out at last The coal proprietor appoints certain gentlemen to take the oversight of 
the workings and it is their policy in order to receive approbation to place things 
on the most economical basis they can and these girls are employed at from s 
up to s d a day where a man at the rate of s d a day would have to be 
employed n   

IV Coroners inquests  

With regard to coroners inquests in your district have the workmen confidence 
in the proceedings at those inquests when accidents occur No they have not 
n  Why not Chiefly because the men who are generally chosen are 
men who know nothing about mines and such like Are not workmen 
summoned at all upon the juries Never but as witnesses to my knowledge 
Who are the people who are generally summoned upon these juries Generally 
tradesmen in the neighbourhood  from their circumstances they are sometimes 
liable to be influenced by their employers  the owners of the works They are 
generally men who have no knowledge and can scarcely understand the witnesses 
who are called before them and the terms which are used and such like Would 
you have the jury composed of persons who had been employed in mining 
Yes partly they the workmen think that the verdict is not in accordance with 
the evidence given generally ns       One great 
object in summoning a jury is to have an impartial one is it not Yes I should 
think so Do you think that the juries would be impartial if they were composed 
to a considerable extent of workmen I cannot see any motive which the 

 

 

 

Chapter  

workmen would have to act partially  they necessarily have a better knowledge 
of the operations in connexion with the mine You do not think there would be a 
tendency on the part of the workmen to return unfairly severe verdicts No I 
think not ns     

V  False  weights  and  measures    The  workmen  demand  to  be  paid  weekly  instead  of 
fortnightly and by weight instead of by cubical contents of the tubs they also demand protection 
against the use of false weights c n  

If the tubs were fraudulently increased a man could discontinue working by 
giving  days notice But if he goes to another place there is the same thing 
going on there n  But he can leave that place where the wrong has been 
committed It is general wherever he goes he has to submit to it n  
Could a man leave by giving  days notice Yes n  And yet they 
are not satisfied  

VI Inspection of mines  Casualties from explosions are not the only things the workmen suffer 
from n  sqq 

Our men complained very much of the bad ventilation of the collieries  the 
ventilation is so bad in general that the men can scarcely breathe they are quite 
unfit for employment of any kind after they have been for a length of time in 
connexion with their work indeed just at the part of the mine where I am 
working men have been obliged to leave their employment and come home in 
consequence of that  some of them have been out of work for weeks just in 
consequence of the bad state of the ventilation where there is not explosive gas  
there is plenty of air generally in the main courses yet pains are not taken to get 
air into the workings where men are working Why do you not apply to the 
inspector To tell the truth there are many men who are timid on that point 
there have been cases of men being sacrificed and losing their employment in 
consequence of applying to the inspector Why is he a marked man for having 
complained Yes And he finds it difficult to get employment in another 
mine Yes Do you think the mines in your neighbourhood are sufficiently 
inspected to insure a compliance with the provisions of the Act No they are 
not inspected at all  the inspector has been down just once in the pit and it has 
been going seven years In the district to which I belong there are not a 
sufficient number of inspectors We have one old man more than  years of age 
to inspect more than  collieries You wish to have a class of sub
inspectors Yes ns          But do you 
think it would be possible for Government to maintain such an army of inspectors 
as would be necessary to do all that you want them to do without information 
from the men No I should think it would be next to impossible It would 
be desirable the inspectors should come oftener Yes and without being sent 
for n   Do you not think that the effect of having these inspectors 
examining the collieries so frequently would be to shift the responsibility  of 
supplying proper ventilation from the owners of the collieries to the Government 
officials No I do not think that I think that they should make it their business 
to enforce the Acts which are already in existence n  When you speak of 
subinspectors do you mean men at a less salary and of an inferior stamp to the 
present inspectors I would not have them inferior if you could get them 
otherwise n  Do you merely want more inspectors or do you want a 

 

 

 

Chapter  

lower class of men as an inspector A man who would knock about and see 
that things are kept right a man who would not be afraid of himself n  If 
you obtained your wish in getting an inferior class of inspectors appointed do you 
think that there would be no danger from want of skill c I think not I think 
that the Government would see after that and have proper men in that position 
n  

This kind of examination becomes at last too much even for the chairman of the committee and 
he interrupts with the observation 

You want a class of men who would look into all the details of the mine and 
would go into all the holes and corners and go into the real facts  they would 
report to the chief inspector who would then bring his scientific knowledge to 
bear on the facts they have stated ns   Would it not entail very great 
expense if all these old workings were kept ventilated Yes expense might be 
incurred but life would be at the same time protected n  
A working miner objects to the th section of the Act of  he says 

At the present time if the inspector of mines finds a part of the mine unfit to 
work in he has to report it to the mineowner and the Home Secretary After 
doing that there is given to the owner  days to look over the matter at the end 
of  days he has the power to refuse making any alteration in the mine but when 
he refuses the mineowner writes to the Home Secretary at the same time 
nominating five engineers and from those five engineers named by the mine
owner himself the Home Secretary appoints one I think as arbitrator or appoints 
arbitrators from them now we think in that case the mineowner virtually 
appoints his own arbitrator n  
Bourgeois examiner himself a mineowner 

But  is this a merely speculative objection n  Then you have a very 
poor opinion of the integrity of mining engineers It is most certainly unjust and 
inequitable n  Do not mining engineers possess a sort of public 
character and do not you think that they are above making such a partial decision 
as you apprehend I do not wish to answer such a question as that with respect 
to the personal character of those men I believe that in many cases they would act 
very partially indeed and that it ought not to be in their hands to do so where 
mens lives are at stake n  

This same bourgeois is not ashamed to put this question Do you not think that the mineowner 
also suffers loss from an explosion Finally Are not you workmen in Lancashire able to take 
care of your own interests without calling in the Government to help you No n   
In the year  there were  coal mines in Great Britain and  inspectors A Yorkshire 
mineowner himself calculates Times th January  that putting on one side their office 
work which absorbs all their time each mine can be visited but once in ten years by an inspector 
No wonder that explosions have increased progressively both in number and extent sometimes 
with a loss of  men during the last ten years These are the beauties of free capitalist 
production This sentence has been added to the English text in conformity with the th German 
edition  Ed  
The  very  defective  Act  passed  in    is  the  first  that  regulates  the  hours  of  labour  of  the 
children employed in mines and makes exploiters and owners to a certain extent responsible for 
socalled accidents  
 

 

Chapter  
 
The  Royal  Commission  appointed  in    to  inquire  into  the  employment  in  agriculture  of 
children  young  persons  and  women  has  published  some  very  important  reports  Several 
attempts to apply the principles of the Factory Acts but in a modified form to agriculture have 
been made but have so far resulted in complete failure All that I wish to draw attention to here is 
the existence of an irresistible tendency towards the general application of those principles  
If  the  general  extension  of  factory  legislation  to  all  trades  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  the 
workingclass  both  in  mind  and  body  has  become  inevitable  on  the  other  hand  as  we  have 
already pointed out that extension hastens on the general conversion of numerous isolated small 
industries into a few combined industries carried on upon a large scale it therefore accelerates the 
concentration of capital and the exclusive predominance of the factory system It destroys both 
the  ancient  and  the  transitional  forms  behind  which  the  dominion  of  capital  is  still  in  part 
concealed  and  replaces  them  by  the  direct  and  open  sway  of  capital  but  thereby  it  also 
generalises  the  direct  opposition  to  this  sway  While  in  each  individual  workshop  it  enforces 
uniformity regularity order and economy it increases by the immense spur which the limitation 
and  regulation  of  the  working  day  give  to  technical  improvement  the  anarchy  and  the 
catastrophes of capitalist production as a whole the intensity of labour and the competition of 
machinery with the labourer By the destruction of petty and domestic industries it destroys the 
last resort of the redundant population and with it the sole remaining safetyvalve of the whole 
social mechanism By maturing the material conditions and the combination on a social scale of 
the processes of production it matures the contradictions and antagonisms of the capitalist form 
of production and thereby provides along with the elements for the formation of a new society 
the forces for exploding the old one  

Section  Modern Industry and Agriculture 

The  revolution  called  forth  by  modern  industry  in  agriculture  and  in  the  social  relations  of 
agricultural producers will be investigated later on In this place we shall merely indicate a few 
results by way of anticipation If the use of machinery in agriculture is for the most part free from 
the injurious physical effect it has on the factory operative its action in superseding the labourers 
is  more  intense  and  finds  less  resistance  as  we  shall  see  later  in  detail  In  the  counties  of 
Cambridge and Suffolk for example the area of cultivated land has extended very much within 
the last  years up to  while in the same period the rural population has diminished not 
only  relatively  but  absolutely  In  the  United  States  it  is  as  yet  only  virtually  that  agricultural 
machines replace labourers in other words they allow of the cultivation by the farmer of a larger 
surface  but  do  not  actually  expel  the  labourers  employed  In    the  number  of  persons 
occupied in England and Wales in the manufacture of agricultural machines was  whilst the 
number of agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and steamengines 
did not exceed   
In the sphere of agriculture modern industry has a more revolutionary effect than elsewhere for 
this reason that it annihilates the peasant that bulwark of the old society and replaces him by the 
wagelabourer Thus the desire for social changes and the class antagonisms are brought to the 
same level in the country as in the towns The irrational oldfashioned methods of agriculture are 
replaced by scientific ones Capitalist production completely tears asunder the old bond of union 
which held together agriculture and manufacture in their infancy But at the same time it creates 
the  material  conditions  for  a  higher  synthesis  in  the  future  viz  the  union  of  agriculture  and 
industry on the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired during their temporary 
separation  Capitalist  production  by  collecting  the  population  in  great  centres  and  causing  an 
everincreasing  preponderance  of  town  population  on  the  one  hand  concentrates  the  historical

motive power of society on the other hand it disturbs the circulation of matter between man and 
the soil ie prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by man in the form of food 
and clothing it therefore violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil By this 
action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the 
rural labourer  But while upsetting the naturally grown conditions for the maintenance of that 
circulation of matter it imperiously calls for its restoration as a system as a regulating law of 
social production and under a form appropriate to the full development of the human race In 
agriculture as in manufacture the transformation of production under the sway of capital means 
at the same time the martyrdom of the producer the instrument of labour becomes the means of 
enslaving exploiting and impoverishing the labourer the social combination and organisation of 
labourprocesses  is  turned  into  an  organised  mode  of  crushing  out  the  workmans  individual 
vitality freedom and independence The dispersion of the rural labourers over larger areas breaks 
their power  of  resistance while  concentration increases that of  the town  operatives  In  modern 
agriculture as in the urban industries the increased productiveness and quantity of the labour set 
in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease labourpower itself 
Moreover all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the 
labourer but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time 
is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility The more a country starts its 
development on the foundation of modern industry like the United States for example the more 
rapid is this process of destruction  Capitalist production therefore develops technology and 
the  combining  together  of  various  processes  into  a  social  whole  only  by  sapping  the  original 
sources of all wealththe soil and the labourer

 Before his time spinning machines although very imperfect ones had already been used and Italy

little any of the inventions of the th century are the work of a single individual Hitherto there is no 
such book Darwin has interested us in the history of Natures Technology ie in the formation of the 
organs  of  plants  and  animals  which  organs  serve  as  instruments  of  production  for  sustaining  life 
Does not the history of the productive organs of man of organs that are the material basis of all social 
organisation deserve equal attention And would not such a history be easier to compile since as 
Vico says human history differs from natural history in this that we have made the former but not 
the  latter Technology  discloses  mans  mode  of  dealing  with  Nature  the  process of  production  by 
which he sustains his life and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations and 
of  the  mental  conceptions  that  flow  from  them  Every  history  of  religion  even  that  fails  to  take 
account of this material basis is uncritical It is in reality much easier to discover by analysis the 
earthly  core  of  the  misty  creations  of  religion  than  conversely  it  is  to  develop  from  the  actual 
relations of life the corresponding celestialised forms of those relations The latter method is the only 
materialistic  and  therefore  the  only  scientific  one  The  weak  points  in  the  abstract  materialism  of

  It  was  partly  the  want  of  streams  with  a  good  fall  on  them  and  partly  their  battles  with 
superabundance  of  water  in  other  respects  that  compelled  the Dutch  to  resort  to wind  as  a  motive

squabble  between  the  nobles  the  priests  and  the  emperor  as  to  which  of  those  three  the  wind 
belonged  The  air  makes  bondage  was  the  cry  in  Germany  at  the  same  time  that  the  wind  was 
making Holland free What it reduced to bondage in this case was not the Dutchman but the land for 
the Dutchman In   windmills of  horsepower were still employed in Holland to 
prevent twothirds of the land from being reconverted into morasses 
 It was indeed very much improved by Watts first socalled single acting engine but in this form

 In January  John C Morton read before the Society of Arts a paper on The forces employed 
in agriculture He there states Every improvement that furthers the uniformity of the land makes the 
steamengine more and more applicable to the production of pure mechanical force Horsepower is 
requisite wherever crooked fences and other obstructions prevent uniform action These obstructions 
are vanishing day by day For operations that demand more exercise of will than actual force the only 
power applicable is that controlled every instant by the human mindin other words manpower Mr 
Morton then reduces steampower horsepower and manpower to the unit in general use for steam
engines namely the force required to raise  lbs one foot in one minute and reckons the cost of 
one horsepower from a steamengine to be d and from a horse to be d per hour Further if a 
horse must fully maintain its health it can work no more than  hours a day Three at the least out of 
every seven horses used on tillage land during the year can be dispensed with by using steampower 
at an expense not greater than that which the horses dispensed with would cost during the  or  
months  in  which  alone  they  can  be  used  effectively  Lastly  steampower  in  those  agricultural 
operations in which it can be employed improves in comparison with horsepower the quality of the 
work To do the work of a steamengine would require  men at a total cost of s an hour and to 
do the work of a horse  men at a total cost of s an hour

  From  the  standpoint  of  division  of  labour  in  Manufacture  weaving  was  not  simple  but  on  the 
contrary complicated manual labour and consequently the powerloom is a machine that does very 
complicated work It is altogether erroneous to suppose that modern machinery originally appropriated 
those operations alone which division of labour had simplified Spinning and weaving were during 
the manufacturing period split up into new species and the implements were modified and improved 
but the labour itself was in no way divided and it retained its handicraft character It is not the labour 
but the instrument of labour that serves as the startingpoint of the machine 
  Before  the  epoch  of  Mechanical  Industry  the  wool  manufacture  was  the  predominating 
manufacture in England Hence it was in this industry that in the first half of the th century the 
most  experiments  were  made  Cotton  which  required  less  careful  preparation  for  its  treatment  by 
machinery derived the benefit of the experience gained on wool just as afterwards the manipulation 
of wool by machinery was developed on the lines of cottonspinning and weaving by machinery It 
was  only  during  the    years  immediately  preceding    that  isolated  details  of  the  wool 
manufacture  such  as  woolcombing  were  incorporated  in  the  factory  system  The  application  of 
power  to  the  process  of  combing  wool    extensively  in  operation  since  the  introduction  of  the 
combingmachine especially Listers  undoubtedly had the effect of throwing a very large number of 
men out of work Wool was formerly combed by hand most frequently in the cottage of the comber It 
is now very generally combed in the factory and handlabour is superseded except in some particular 
kinds  of  work  in  which  handcombed  wool  is  still  preferred  Many  of  the  handcombers  found 
employment in the factories but the produce of the handcombers bears so small a proportion to that 
of the machine that the employment of a very large number of combers has passed away Rep of

loom with the old one of the modern blowing apparatus of a blastfurnace with the first inefficient 
mechanical reproduction of the ordinary bellows and perhaps more strikingly than in any other way 
by the attempts before the invention of the present locomotive to construct a locomotive that actually 
had two feet which after the fashion of a horse it raised alternately from the ground It is only after

 Science generally speaking costs the capitalist nothing a fact that by no means hinders him from 
exploiting it The science of others is as much annexed by capital as the labour of others Capitalistic 
appropriation  and  personal  appropriation  whether  of  science  or  of  material  wealth  are  however 
totally different things Dr Ure himself deplores the gross ignorance of mechanical science existing 
among  his  dear  machineryexploiting  manufacturers  and  Liebig  can  a  tale  unfold  about  the 
astounding ignorance of chemistry displayed by English chemical manufacturers 
 Ricardo lays such stress on this effect of machinery of which in other connexions he takes no 
more  notice  than  he  does  of  the  general  distinction  between  the  labour  process  and  the  process  of 
creating  surplusvalue  that  he  occasionally  loses  sight  of  the  value  given  up  by  machines  to  the 
product  and  puts  machines  on  the  same  footing  as  natural  forces  Thus  Adam  Smith  nowhere 
undervalues the services which the natural agents and machinery perform for us but he very justly 
distinguishes  the  nature  of  the  value  which  they  add  to  commodities  as  they  perform  their  work 
gratuitously the assistance which they afford us adds nothing to value in exchange Ric lc pp 
  This observation of Ricardo is of course correct in so far as it is directed against J B Say 
who imagines that machines render the service of creating value which forms a part of profits 
  A  horsepower  is  equal  to  a  force  of    footpounds  per  minute  ie  to  a  force  that  raises 
 pounds one foot in a minute or one pound  feet This is the horse power meant in the 
text In ordinary language and also here and there in quotations in this work a distinction is drawn 
between the nominal and the commercial or indicated horsepower of the same engine The old 
or nominal horsepower is calculated exclusively from the length of pistonstroke and the diameter of 
the  cylinder  and  leaves  pressure  of  steam  and  piston  speed  out  of  consideration  It  expresses 
practically  this  This  engine  would  be  one  of   horsepower  if  it  were  driven  with  the  same  low 
pressure of steam and the same slow piston speed as in the days of Boulton and Watt But the two 
latter factors have increased enormously since those days In order to measure the mechanical force 
exerted today by an engine an indicator has been invented which shows the pressure of the steam in 
the  cylinder  The  piston  speed  is  easily  ascertained  Thus  the  indicated  or  commercial  horse
power of an engine is expressed by a mathematical formula involving diameter of cylinder length of 
stroke  piston  speed  and  steam  pressure  simultaneously  and  showing  what  multiple  of   
pounds is really raised by the engine in a minute Hence one nominal horsepower may exert three 
four  or  even  five  indicated  or  real  horsepowers  This  observation  is  made  for  the  purpose  of 
explaining various citations in the subsequent pages  F E 
  The  reader  who  is  imbued  with  capitalist  notions  will  naturally  miss  here  the  interest  that  the 
machine in proportion to its capital value adds to the product It is however easily seen that since a 
machine no more creates new value than any other part of constant capital it cannot add any value 
under the name of interest It is also evident that here where we are treating of the production of 
surplusvalue we cannot assume a priori the existence of any part of that value under the name of 
interest The capitalist mode of calculating which appears prim facie absurd and repugnant to the 
laws of the creation of value will be explained in the third book of this work 
 This portion of value which is added by the machinery decreases both absolutely and relatively 
when  the  machinery  does  away  with  horses  and  other  animals  that  are  employed  as  mere  moving

certain  family  functions  such  as  nursing  and  suckling  children  cannot  be  entirely  suppressed  the 
mothers confiscated by capital must try substitutes of some sort Domestic work such as sewing and 
mending must be replaced by the purchase of readymade articles Hence the diminished expenditure 
of labour in the house is accompanied by an increased expenditure of money The cost of keeping the

 The English who have a tendency to look upon the earliest form of appearance of a thing as the 
cause of its existence are in the habit of attributing the long hours of work in factories to the extensive 
kidnapping of children practised by capitalists in the infancy of the factory system on workhouses 
and orphanages by means of which robbery unresisting material for exploitation was procured Thus 
for instance Ficiden himself a manufacturer says It  is evident that the long hours of work were

 The Manchester Spinner Times th Nov  before referred to says in relation to this subject 
It namely the allowance for deterioration of machinery is also intended to cover the loss which is 
constantly arising from the superseding of machines before they are worn out by others of a new and 
better construction 
 It has been estimated roughly that the first individual of a newlyinvented machine will cost about 
five times as much as the construction of the second Babbage lc p  
 The improvements which took place not long ago in frames for making patent net were so great 
that a machine in good repair which had cost  sold a few years after for   improvements 
succeeded each other so rapidly that machines which had never been finished were abandoned in the 
hands  of  their  makers  because  new  improvements  had  superseded  their  utility  Babbage  lc  p 
 In these stormy goahead times therefore the tulle manufacturers soon extended the working 
day by means of double sets of hands from the original  hours to  
 It is selfevident that amid the ebbings and flowings of the markets and the alternate expansions 
and contractions of demand occasions will constantly recur in which the manufacturer may employ 
additional floating capital without employing additional fixed capital if additional quantities of raw 
material can be worked up without incurring an additional expense for buildings and machinery R

these  differences  are  as  Adam  Smith  has  shown  compensated  to  a  partial  extent  by  minor 
circumstances peculiar to each sort of labour Labourtime as a measure of value is not however 
affected in this case except in so far as the duration of labour and the degree of its intensity are two

category  of  factory  operatives  not  only  engineers  mechanics  c  but  also  managers  salesmen 
messengers warehousemen packers c in short everybody except the owner of the factory himself 
 Ure grants this He says in case of need the workmen can be moved at the will of the manager 
from one machine to another and he triumphantly exclaims Such a change is in flat contradiction 
with the old routine that divides the labour and to one workman assigns the task of fashioning the 
head of a needle to another the sharpening of the point He had much better have asked himself why 
this old routine is departed from in the automatic factory only in case of need

English ateliers nationaux national workshops of  and the following years established for the 
benefit of the destitute cotton operatives differ from the French of  in this that in the latter the 
workmen  had  to  do  unproductive  work  at  the  expense  of  the  state  in  the  former  they  had  to  do 
productive municipal work to the advantage of the bourgeois and that too cheaper than the regular 
workmen with whom they were thus thrown into competition The physical appearance of the cotton

children  from  their  creeping  under  the  mules  to  sweep  the  floor  whilst  the  mules  are  in  motion 
Several  minders  have  been  fined  for  this  offence  but  without  much  general  benefit  If  machine 
makers would only invent a selfsweeper by whose use the necessity for these little children to creep 
under the machinery might be prevented it would be a happy addition to our protective measures

 The slavery in which the bourgeoisie has bound the proletariat comes nowhere more plainly into 
daylight than in the factory system In it all freedom comes to an end both at law and in fact The 
workman must be in the factory at half past five If he come a few minutes late he is punished if he 
come  minutes late he is not allowed to enter until after breakfast and thus loses a quarter of a 
days wage He must eat drink and sleep at word of command The despotic bell calls him from his 
bed calls him from breakfast and dinner And how does he fare in the mill There the master is the 
absolute lawgiver He makes what regulations he pleases he alters and makes additions to his code at 
pleasure and if he insert the veriest nonsense the courts say to the workman Since you have entered 
into this contract voluntarily you must now carry it out  These workmen are condemned to live 
from their ninth year till their death under this mental and bodily torture F Engels lc p  sq 
What the courts say I will illustrate by two examples One occurs at Sheffield at the end of  
In that town a workman had engaged himself for  years in a steelworks In consequence of a quarrel 
with his employer he left the works and declared that under no circumstances would he work for that 
master  any  more  He  was  prosecuted  for  breach  of  contract  and  condemned  to  two  months 
imprisonment If the master break the contract he can be proceeded against only in a civil action and 
risks nothing but money damages After the workman has served his two months the master invites 
him to return to the works pursuant to the contract Workman says No he has already been punished 
for the breach The master prosecutes again the court condemns again although one of the judges 
Mr Shee publicly denounces this as a legal monstrosity by which a man can periodically as long as 
he lives be punished over and over again for the same offence or crime This judgment was given not 
by  the  Great  Unpaid  the  provincial  Dogberries  but  by  one  of  the  highest  courts  of  justice  in 
London    Added  in  the  th  German  edition    This  has  now  been  done  away  with  With  few 
exceptions eg when public gasworks are involved the worker in England is now put on an equal 
footing with the employer in case of breach of contract and can be sued only civilly  F E The 
second case occurs in Wiltshire at the end of November  About  powerloom weavers in the 
employment  of  one  Harrup  a  cloth  manufacturer  at  Leowers  Mill  Westbury  Leigh  struck  work 
because  master  Harrup  indulged  in  the  agreeable  habit  of  making  deductions  from  their  wages  for 
being late in the morning d for  minutes s for  minutes and s d for ten minutes This is at 
the rate of s per hour and  s d per diem while the wages of the weavers on the average of a 
year never exceeded s to s weekly Harrup also appointed a boy to announce the starting time 
by a whistle which he often did before six oclock in the morning and if the hands were not all there 
at  the  moment  the  whistle  ceased  the  doors  were  closed  and  those  hands  who  were  outside  were 
fined  and  as  there  was  no  clock  on  the  premises  the  unfortunate  hands  were  at  the  mercy  of  the 
young Harrupinspired timekeeper The hands on strike mothers of families as well as girls offered 
to resume work if the timekeeper were replaced by a clock and a more reasonable scale of fines were 
introduced Harrup summoned I women and girls before the magistrates for breach of contract To 
the  utter  indignation  of  all  present  they  were  each  mulcted  in  a  fine  of  d  and  s  d  for  costs 
Harrup was followed from the court by a crowd of people who hissed him A favourite operation with 
manufacturers is to punish the workpeople by deductions made from their wages on account of faults 
in the material worked on This method gave rise in  to a general strike in the English pottery 
districts  The  reports  of  the  Ch  Empl  Com    give  cases  where  the  worker  not  only 
receives no wages but becomes by means of his labour and of the penal regulations the debtor to 
boot  of  his  worthy  master  The  late  cotton  crisis  also  furnished  edifying  examples  of  the  sagacity 
shown  by  the  factory  autocrats  in  making  deductions  from  wages  Mr  R  Baker  the  Inspector  of 
Factories says I have myself had lately to direct prosecutions against one cotton mill occupier for 
having in these pinching and painful times deducted d a piece from some of the young workers 
employed by him for the surgeons certificate for which he himself had only paid d when only 
allowed  by  the  law  to  deduct  d  and  by  custom  nothing  at  all    And  I  have  been  informed  of

beyond their official dates 
  The  protection  afforded  by  the  Factory  Acts  against  dangerous  machinery  has  had  a  beneficial 
effect  But    there  are  other  sources  of  accident  which  did  not  exist  twenty  years  since  one 
especially viz the increased speed of the machinery Wheels rollers spindles and shuttles are now 
propelled at increased and increasing rates fingers must be quicker and defter in their movements to 
take up the broken thread for if placed with hesitation or carelessness they are sacrificed A large 
number  of  accidents  are  caused  by  the  eagerness  of  the  workpeople  to  get  through  their  work 
expeditiously It must be remembered that it is of the highest importance to manufacturers that their 
machinery should be in motion ie producing yarns and goods Every minutes stoppage is not only a 
loss of power but of production and the workpeople are urged by the overlookers who are interested 
in the quantity of work turned off to keep the machinery in motion and it is no less important to those 
of the operatives who are paid by the weight or piece that the machines should be kept in motion 
Consequently although it is strictly forbidden in many nay in most factories that machinery should 
be  cleaned  while  in  motion  it  is  nevertheless  the  constant  practice  in  most  if  not  in  all  that  the 
workpeople do unreproved pick out waste wipe rollers and wheels c while their frames are in 
motion Thus from this cause only  accidents have occurred during the six months Although a 
great deal of cleaning is constantly going on day by day yet Saturday is generally the day set apart for 
the thorough cleaning of the machinery and a great deal of this  is done while the machinery is in 
motion  Since  cleaning  is  not  paid  for  the  workpeople  seek  to  get  done  with  it  as  speedily  as 
possible  Hence  the  number  of  accidents  which  occur  on  Fridays  and  especially  on  Saturdays  is 
much  larger  than  on  any  other  day  On  the  former  day  the  excess  is  nearly    per  cent  over  the 
average number of the four first days of the week and on the latter day the excess is  per cent over 
the average of the preceding five days or if the number of workinghours on Saturday being taken 
into account   hours on Saturday as compared with  on other days  there is an excess of  
per cent on Saturdays over the average of the other five days Rep of Insp of Fact st Oct

 In Part I of Book III I shall give an account of a recent campaign by the English manufacturers 
against the Clauses in the Factory Acts that protect the hands against dangerous machinery For the 
present let this one quotation from the official report of Leonard Horner suffice I have heard some 
millowners speak with inexcusable levity of some of the accidents such for instance as the loss of a 
finger being a trifling matter A workingmans living and prospects depend so much upon his fingers 
that any loss of them is a very serious matter to him When I have heard such inconsiderate remarks 
made I have usually put this question Suppose you were in want of an additional workman and two 
were to apply both equally well qualified in other respects but one had lost a thumb or a forefinger 
which would you engage There never was a hesitation as to the answer The manufacturers have 
mistaken prejudices against what they have heard represented as a pseudophilanthropic legislation 
Rep of Insp of Fact st Oct  These manufacturers are clever folk and not without reason 
were they enthusiastic for the slaveholders rebellion 
  In  those  factories  that  have  been  longest  subject  to  the  Factory  Acts  with  their  compulsory

 Machinery and labour are in constant competition Ricardo lc p  
 The competition between handweaving and powerweaving in England before the passing of the 
Poor Law of  was prolonged by supplementing the wages which had fallen considerably below 
the minimum with parish relief The Rev Mr Turner was in  rector of Wilmslow in Cheshire 
a manufacturing district The questions of the Committee of Emigration and Mr Turners answers 
show how the competition of human labour is maintained against machinery Question Has not the 
use of the powerloom superseded the use of the handloom Answer Undoubtedly it would have 
superseded them much more than it has done if the handloom weavers were not enabled to submit to 
a reduction of wages Question But in submitting he has accepted wages which are insufficient to 
support him and looks to parochial contribution as the remainder of his support Answer Yes and in 
fact the competition between the handloom and the powerloom is maintained out of the poorrates

 In an appeal made in July  to the Trade Societies of England by the shoemakers of Leicester 
who had been thrown on the streets by a lockout it is stated Twenty years ago the Leicester shoe 
trade was revolutionised by the introduction of riveting in the place of stitching At that time good 
wages could be earned Great competition was shown between the different firms as to which could 
turn  out  the  neatest  article  Shortly  afterwards  however  a  worse  kind  of  competition  sprang  up 
namely that of underselling one another in the market The injurious consequences soon manifested 
themselves in reductions of wages and so sweepingly quick was the fall in the price of labour that 
many firms now pay only one half of the original wages And yet though wages sink lower and lower 
profits appear with each alteration in the scale of wages to increase Even bad times are utilised by 
the  manufacturers  for  making  exceptional  profits  by  excessive  lowering  of  wages  ie  by  a  direct 
robbery  of  the  labourers  means  of  subsistence  One  example  it  has  reference  to  the  crisis  in  the 
Coventry silk weaving From information I have received from manufacturers as well as workmen 
there  seems  to  be  no  doubt  that  wages  have  been  reduced  to  a  greater  extent  than  either  the 
competition of the foreign producers or other circumstances have rendered necessary  the majority 
of  weavers  are  working  at  a  reduction  of    to    per  cent  in  their  wages  A  piece  of  ribbon  for 
making which the weaver got s or s five years back now only brings them s d or s d other 
work is now priced at s and s d which was formerly priced at s and s d The reduction in 
wage seems to have been carried to a greater extent than is necessary for increasing demand Indeed 
the  reduction  in  the  cost  of  weaving  in  the  case  of  many  descriptions  of  ribbons  has  not  been 
accompanied by any corresponding reduction in the selling price of the manufactured article Mr F

 but the real or marketable value was only  being a tenfold quantity sold 
for  little  more  than  double  the  former  price  To  produce  results  so  disadvantageous  to  the  country 
generally  and  to  the  factory  workers  in  particular  several  causes  have  cooperated  which  had 
circumstances permitted we should have brought more prominently under your notice suffice it for 
the present to say that the most obvious one is the constant redundancy of labour without which a 
trade  so  ruinous  in  its  effects  never  could  have  been  carried  on  and  which  requires  a  constantly 
extending  market  to  save  it  from  annihilation  Our  cotton  mills  may  be  brought  to  a  stand  by  the 
periodical stagnations of trade which under present arrangements are as inevitable as death itself but 
the human mind is constantly at work and although we believe we are under the mark in stating that 
six millions of persons have left these shores during the last  years yet from the natural increase of 
population  and  the  displacement  of  labour  to  cheapen  production  a  large  percentage  of  the  male

 Textile Mills Here everything remains about as it was children more than  years of age may 
work  hours a day or  hours and Saturday off young persons and women  hours on  days and 
at most  on Saturday  
 NonTextile Factories Here the regulations are brought closer than before to those of No  but 
there  are  still  several  exceptions  which  favour  the  capitalists  and  which  in  certain  cases  may  be 
expanded by special permission of the Home Secretary  
 Workshops defined approximately as in the former Act as for the children young workers and 
women  employed  there  the  workshops  are  about  on  a par  with  the  nontextile  factories  but  again 
conditions are easier in details  
 Workshops in which no children or young workers are employed but only persons of both sexes 
above the age of  this category enjoy still easier conditions  
 Domestic Workshops where only members of the family are employed in the family dwelling 
still more elastic regulations and simultaneously the restriction that the inspector may without special 
permission of the ministry or a court enter only rooms not used also for dwelling purposes and lastly 
unrestricted freedom for strawplaiting and lace and glovemaking by members of the family With all 
its defects this Act together with the Swiss Federal Factory Law of March   is still by far the 
best piece of legislation in this field A comparison of it with the said Swiss federal law is of particular 
interest because it clearly demonstrates the merits and demerits of the two legislative methods  the 
English historical method which intervenes when occasion requires and the continental method 
which is built up on the traditions of the French Revolution and generalises more Unfortunately due 
to insufficient inspection personnel the English code is still largely a dead letter with regard to its 
application to workshops  F E

although not free from gross errors contains flashes of light It is however to be regretted that he 
ventures on such haphazard assertions as the following By greater pulverising and more frequent 
ploughing the circulation of air in the interior of porous soil is aided and the surface exposed to the 
action of the atmosphere is increased and renewed but it is easily seen that the increased yield of the 
land  cannot  be  proportional  to  the  labour  spent  on  that  land  but  increases  in  a  much  smaller 
proportion This law adds Liebig was first enunciated by John Stuart Mill in his Principles of Pol 
Econ  Vol    p    as  follows  That  the  produce  of  land  increases  caeteris  paribus  in  a 
diminishing  ratio  to  the  increase  of  the  labourers  employed  Mill  here  introduces  in  an  erroneous 
form the law enunciated by Ricardos school for since the decrease of the labourers employed kept 
even pace in England with the advance of agriculture the law discovered in and applied to England 
could have no application to that country at all events is the universal law of agricultural industry 
This is very remarkable since Mill was ignorant of the reason for this law Liebig lc Bd I p

understands  something  quite  different  from  what  Political  Economy  does  it  is  in  any  case  very 
remarkable that he should make Mr John Stuart Mill the first propounder of a theory which was first 
published  by  James  Anderson  in  A  Smiths  days  and  was  repeated  in  various  works  down  to  the 
beginning of the th century a theory which Malthus that master in plagiarism the whole of his 
population theory is a shameless plagiarism appropriated to himself in  which West developed

Chapter  Absolute and Relative Surplus

Value 

In considering the labourprocess we began see Chapter VII by treating it in the abstract apart 
from its historical forms as a process between man and Nature We there stated If we examine 
the whole labourprocess from the point of view of its result it is plain that both the instruments 
and the subject of labour are means of production and that the labour itself is productive labour 
And in Note  same page we further added This method of determining from the standpoint of 
the labourprocess alone what is productive labour is by no means directly applicable to the case 
of  the  capitalist  process  of  production  We  now  proceed  to  the  further  development  of  this 
subject 
So far as the labourprocess is purely individual one and the same labourer unites in himself all 
the functions that later on become separated When an individual appropriates natural objects for 
his livelihood no one controls him but himself Afterwards he is controlled by others A single 
man cannot operate upon Nature without calling his own muscles into play under the control of 
his own brain As in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other so the labourprocess 
unites the labour of the hand with that of the head Later on they part company and even become 
deadly foes The product ceases to be the direct product of the individual and becomes a social 
product produced in common by a collective labourer ie by a combination of workmen each 
of whom takes only a part greater or less in the manipulation of the subject of their labour As 
the  cooperative  character  of  the  labourprocess  becomes  more  and  more  marked  so  as  a 
necessary  consequence  does  our  notion  of  productive  labour  and  of  its  agent  the  productive 
labourer become extended In order to labour productively it is no longer necessary for you to do 
manual work yourself enough if you are an organ of the collective labourer and perform one of 
its  subordinate  functions  The  first  definition  given  above  of  productive  labour  a  definition 
deduced from the very nature of the production of material objects still remains correct for the 
collective labourer considered as a whole But it no longer holds good for each member taken 
individually 
On  the  other  hand  however  our  notion  of  productive  labour  becomes  narrowed  Capitalist 
production  is  not  merely  the  production  of  commodities  it  is  essentially  the  production  of 
surplusvalue  The  labourer  produces  not  for  himself  but  for  capital  It  no  longer  suffices 
therefore that he should simply produce He must produce surplusvalue That labourer alone is 
productive who produces surplusvalue for the capitalist and thus works for the selfexpansion 
of capital If we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects a 
schoolmaster is a productive labourer when in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars 
he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor That the latter has laid out his capital in a 
teaching factory instead of in a sausage factory does not alter the relation Hence the notion of a 
productive  labourer  implies  not  merely  a  relation  between  work  and  useful  effect  between 
labourer and product of labour but also a specific social relation of production a relation that 
has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of creating surplusvalue 
To be a productive labourer is therefore not a piece of luck but a misfortune In Book IV which 
treats of the history of the theory it will be more clearly seen that the production of surplusvalue 
has at all times been made by classical political economists the distinguishing characteristic of 
the  productive  labourer  Hence  their  definition  of  a  productive  labourer  changes  with  their 
comprehension of the nature of surplusvalue Thus the Physiocrats insist that only agricultural 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labour is productive since that alone they say yields a surplusvalue And they say so because 
with them surplusvalue has no existence except in the form of rent 
The  prolongation  of  the  working  day  beyond  the  point  at  which  the  labourer  would  have 
produced  just  an  equivalent  for  the  value  of  his  labourpower  and  the  appropriation  of  that 
surplus  labour  by  capital  this  is  production  of  absolute  surplusvalue  It  forms  the  general 
groundwork of the capitalist system and the startingpoint for the production of relative surplus
value The latter presupposes that the working day is already divided into two parts necessary 
labour  and  surplus  labour  In  order  to  prolong  the  surplus  labour  the  necessary  labour  is 
shortened  by  methods  whereby  the  equivalent  for  the  wages  is  produced  in  less  time  The 
production of absolute surplusvalue turns exclusively upon the length of the working day the 
production of relative surplusvalue revolutionises out and out the technical processes of labour 
and the composition of society It therefore presupposes a specific mode the capitalist mode of 
production a mode which along with its methods means and conditions arises and develops 
itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to capital In 
the course of this development the formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labour 
to capital 
It  will  suffice  merely  to  refer  to  certain  intermediate  forms  in  which  surplus  labour  is  not 
extorted by direct compulsion from the producer nor the producer himself yet formally subjected 
to capital In such forms capital has not yet acquired the direct control of the labourprocess By 
the side of independent producers who carry on their handicrafts and agriculture in the traditional 
oldfashioned way there stands the usurer or the merchant with his usurers capital or merchants 
capital  feeding  on  them  like  a  parasite  The  predominance  in  a  society  of  this  form  of 
exploitation excludes the capitalist mode of production to which mode however this form may 
serve  as  a  transition  as  it  did  towards  the  close  of  the  Middle  Ages  Finally  as  is  shown  by 
modern  domestic  industry  some  intermediate  forms  are  here  and  there  reproduced  in  the 
background of Modern Industry though their physiognomy is totally changed 
If on the one hand the mere formal subjection of labour to capital suffices for the production of 
absolute surplusvalue if eg it is sufficient that handicraftsmen who previously worked on their 
own  account  or  as  apprentices  of  a  master  should  become  wage  labourers  under  the  direct 
control of a capitalist so on the other hand we have seen how the methods of producing relative 
surplusvalue are at the same time methods of producing absolute surplusvalue Nay more the 
excessive  prolongation  of  the  working  day  turned  out  to  be  the  peculiar  product  of  Modern 
Industry Generally speaking the specifically capitalist mode of production ceases to be a mere 
means of producing relative surplusvalue so soon as that mode has conquered an entire branch 
of production and still more so so soon as it has conquered all the important branches It then 
becomes the general socially predominant form of production As a special method of producing 
relative surplusvalue it remains effective only first in so far as it seizes upon industries that 
previously were only formally subject to capital that is so far as it is propagandist secondly in 
so far as the industries that have been taken over by it continue to be revolutionised by changes 
in the methods of production 
From  one  standpoint  any  distinction  between  absolute  and  relative  surplusvalue  appears 
illusory  Relative  surplusvalue  is  absolute  since  it  compels  the  absolute  prolongation  of  the 
working day beyond the labourtime necessary to the existence of the labourer himself Absolute 
surplusvalue is relative since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness of 
labour as will allow of the necessary labourtime being confined to a portion of the working day 
But if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplusvalue this appearance of identity vanishes Once 
the  capitalist  mode  of  production  is  established  and  become  general  the  difference  between 

 

 

Chapter  
 
absolute and relative surplusvalue makes itself felt whenever there is a question of raising the 
rate of surplusvalue Assuming that labourpower is paid for at its value we are confronted by 
this alternative given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity the rate of surplus
value can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the working day on the other hand given 
the  length  of  the  working  day  that  rise  can  be  effected  only  by  a  change  in  the  relative 
magnitudes of the components of the working day viz necessary labour and surplus labour a 
change which if the wages are not to fall below the value of labourpower presupposes a change 
either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour  
If the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means of subsistence for himself and 
his  race  he  has  no  time  left  in  which  to  work  gratis  for  others  Without  a  certain  degree  of 
productiveness  in  his  labour  he  has  no  such  superfluous  time  at  his  disposal  without  such 
superfluous time no surplus labour and therefore no capitalists no slaveowners no feudal lords 
in one word no class of large proprietors  
Thus we may say that surplusvalue rests on a natural basis but this is permissible only in the 
very  general  sense  that  there  is  no  natural  obstacle  absolutely  preventing  one  man  from 
disburdening himself of the labour requisite for his own existence and burdening another with it 
any  more  for  instance  than  unconquerable  natural  obstacle  prevent  one  man  from  eating  the 
flesh of another No mystical ideas must in any way be connected as sometimes happens with 
this historically developed productiveness of labour It is only after men have raised themselves 
above the rank of animals when therefore their labour has been to some extent socialised that a 
state of things arises in which the surplus labour of the one becomes a condition of existence for 
the other At the dawn of civilisation the productiveness acquired by labour is small but so too 
are  the  wants  which  develop  with  and  by  the  means  of  satisfying  them  Further  at  that  early 
period the portion of society that lives on the labour of others is infinitely small compared with 
the mass of direct producers Along with the progress in the productiveness of labour that small 
portion  of  society  increases  both  absolutely  and  relatively  Besides  capital  with  its 
accompanying relations springs up from an economic soil that is the product of a long process of 
development The productiveness of labour that serves as its foundation and startingpoint is a 
gift not of nature but of a history embracing thousands of centuries 
Apart  from  the  degree  of  development  greater  or  less  in  the  form  of  social  production  the 
productiveness  of  labour  is  fettered  by  physical  conditions  These  are  all  referable  to  the 
constitution  of  man  himself  race  c  and  to  surrounding  nature  The  external  physical 
conditions fall into two great economic classes  Natural wealth in means of subsistence ie a 
fruitful soil waters teeming with fish c and  natural wealth in the instruments of labour 
such as waterfalls navigable rivers wood metal coal c At the dawn of civilisation it is the 
first class that turns the scale at a higher stage of development it is the second Compare for 
example England with India or in ancient times Athens and Corinth with the shores of the Black 
Sea  
The fewer the number of natural wants imperatively calling for satisfaction and the greater the 
natural fertility of the soil and the favourableness of the climate so much less is the labourtime 
necessary for the maintenance and reproduction of the producer So much greater therefore can be 
the excess of his labours for others over his labour for himself Diodorus long ago remarked this 
in relation to the ancient Egyptians 

It is altogether incredible how little trouble and expense the bringing up of their 
children causes them They cook for them the first simple food at hand they also 
give them the lower part of the papyrus stem to eat so far as it can be roasted in 
the fire and the roots and stalks of marsh plants some raw some boiled and 

 

 

 

Chapter  

roasted Most of the children go without shoes and unclothed for the air is so 
mild Hence a child until he is grown up costs his parents not more on the 
whole than twenty drachmas It is this chiefly which explains why the 
population of Egypt is so numerous and therefore why so many great works can 
be undertaken  

Nevertheless the grand structures of ancient Egypt are less due to the extent of its population than 
to the large proportion of it that was freely disposable Just as the individual labourer can do more 
surplus labour in proportion as his necessary labourtime is less so with regard to the working 
population The smaller the part of it which is required for the production of the necessary means 
of subsistence so much the greater is the part that can be set to do other work  
Capitalist production once assumed then all other circumstances remaining the same and given 
the  length  of  the  working  day  the  quantity  of  surplus  labour  will  vary  with  the  physical 
conditions of labour especially with the fertility of the soil But it by no means follows from this 
that the most fruitful soil is the most fitted for the growth of the capitalist mode of production 
This mode is based on the dominion of man over nature Where nature is too lavish she keeps 
him  in  hand  like  a  child  in  leadingstrings  She  does  not  impose  upon  him  any  necessity  to 
develop himself It is not the tropics with their luxuriant vegetation but the temperate zone that 
is the mothercountry of capital It is not the mere fertility of the soil but the differentiation of the 
soil the variety of its natural products the changes of the seasons which form the physical basis 
for the social division of labour and which by changes in the natural surroundings spur man on 
to  the  multiplication  of  his  wants  his  capabilities  his  means  and  modes  of  labour  It  is  the 
necessity  of  bringing  a  natural  force  under  the  control  of  society  of  economising  of 
appropriating  or  subduing  it  on  a  large  scale  by  the  work  of  mans  hand  that  first  plays  the 
decisive part in the history of industry Examples are the irrigation works in Egypt Lombardy 
Holland or in India and Persia where irrigation by means of artificial canals not only supplies the 
soil with the water indispensable to it but also carries down to it in the shape of sediment from 
the  hills  mineral fertilisers  The  secret  of  the  flourishing  state  of  industry  in  Spain  and  Sicily 
under the dominion of the Arabs lay in their irrigation works  
Favourable  natural  conditions  alone  give  us  only  the  possibility  never  the  reality  of  surplus 
labour nor consequently of surplusvalue and a surplusproduct The result of difference in the 
natural  conditions  of  labour  is  this  that  the  same  quantity  of  labour  satisfies  in  different 
countries  a  different  mass  of  requirements  consequently  that  under  circumstances  in  other 
respects analogous the necessary labourtime is different These conditions affect surplus labour 
only as natural limits ie by fixing the points at which labour for others can begin In proportion 
as  industry  advances  these  natural  limits  recede  In  the  midst  of  our  West  European  society 
where the labourer purchases the right to work for his own livelihood only by paying for it in 
surplus labour the idea easily takes root that it is an inherent quality of human labour to furnish a 
surplusproduct But consider for example an inhabitant of the eastern islands of the Asiatic 
Archipelago where sago grows wild in the forests 

When the inhabitants have convinced themselves by boring a hole in the tree 
that the pith is ripe the trunk is cut down and divided into several pieces the pith 
is extracted mixed with water and filtered it is then quite fit for use as sago One 
tree commonly yields  lbs and occasionally  to  lbs There then 
people go into the forests and cut bread for themselves just as with us they cut 
firewood  

Suppose now such an eastern breadcutter requires  working hours a week for the satisfaction 
of all his wants Natures direct gift to him is plenty of leisure time Before he can apply this 
 

 

Chapter  
 
leisure time productively for himself a whole series of historical events is required before he 
spends it in surplus labour for strangers compulsion is necessary If capitalist production were 
introduced the honest fellow would perhaps have to work six days a week in order to appropriate 
to himself the product of one working day The bounty of Nature does not explain why he would 
then have to work  days a week or why he must furnish  days of surplus labour It explains 
only why his necessary labourtime would be limited to one day a week But in no case would his 
surplusproduct arise from some occult quality inherent in human labour  
Thus not only does the historically developed social productiveness of labour but also its natural 
productiveness appear to be productiveness of the capital with which that labour is incorporated  
Ricardo never concerns himself about the origin of surplusvalue He treats it as a thing inherent 
in  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  which  mode  in  his  eyes  is  the  natural  form  of  social 
production Whenever he discusses the productiveness of labour he seeks in it not the cause of 
surplusvalue but the cause that determines the magnitude of that value On the other hand his 
school has openly proclaimed the productiveness of labour to be the originating cause of profit 
read Surplusvalue This at all events is a progress as against the mercantilists who on their 
side derived the excess of the price over the cost of production of the product from the act of 
exchange  from  the  product  being  sold  above  its  value  Nevertheless  Ricardos  school  simply 
shirked the problem they did not solve it In fact these bourgeois economists instinctively saw 
and rightly so that it is very dangerous to stir too deeply the burning question of the origin of 
surplusvalue But what are we to think of John Stuart Mill who half a century after Ricardo 
solemnly claims superiority over the mercantilists by clumsily repeating the wretched evasions 
of Ricardos earliest vulgarisers  
Mill says 

The cause of profit is that labour produces more than is required for its support  
So far nothing but the old story but Mill wishing to add something of his own proceeds 

To vary the form of the theorem the reason why capital yields a profit is 
because food clothing materials and tools last longer than the time which was 
required to produce them  

He here confounds the duration of labourtime with the duration of its products According to this 
view a baker whose product lasts only a day could never extract from his workpeople the same 
profit as a machine maker whose products endure for  years and more Of course it is very 
true that if a birds nest did not last longer than the time it takes in building birds would have to 
do without nests  
This  fundamental  truth  once  established  Mill  establishes  his  own  superiority  over  the 
mercantilists 

We thus see he proceeds that profit arises not from the incident of exchange 
but from the productive power of labour and the general profit of the country is 
always what the productive power of labour makes it whether any exchange takes 
place or not If there were no division of employments there would be no buying 
or selling but there would still be profit  

For Mill then exchange buying and selling those general conditions of capitalist production are 
but an incident and there would always be profits even without the purchase and sale of labour
power 
If he continues the labourers of the country collectively produce twenty per cent more than 
their wages profits will be twenty per cent whatever prices may or may not be This is on the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
one  hand  a  rare  bit  of  tautology  for  if  labourers  produce  a  surplusvalue  of    for  the 
capitalist his profit will be to the total wages of the labourers as  On the other hand it is 
absolutely  false  to  say  that  profits  will  be    They  will  always  be  less  because  they  are 
calculated  upon  the  sum  total  of  the  capital  advanced  If  for  example  the  capitalist  have 
advanced  of which OO is laid out in means of production and  in wages and if the 
rate of surplusvalue be  the rate of profit will be  ie  and not   
Then follows a splendid example of Mills method of handling the different historical forms of 
social production 

I assume throughout the state of things which where the labourers and 
capitalists are separate classes prevails with few exceptions universally namely 
that the capitalist advances the whole expenses including the entire remuneration 
of the labourer  

Strange optical illusion to see everywhere a state of things which as yet exists only exceptionally 
on our earth But let us finish  Mill is willing to concede 

that he should do so is not a matter of inherent necessity On the contrary the 
labourer might wait until the production is complete for all that part of his wages 
which exceeds mere necessaries and even for the whole if he has funds in hand 
sufficient for his temporary support But in the latter case the labourer is to that 
extent really a capitalist in the concern by supplying a portion of the funds 
necessary for carrying it on  

Mill might have gone further and have added that the labourer who advances to himself not only 
the necessaries of life but also the means of production is in reality nothing but his own wage
labourer He might also have said that the American peasant proprietor is but a serf who does 
enforced labour for himself instead of for his lord  
After  thus  proving  clearly  that  even  if  capitalist  production  had  no  existence  still  it  would 
always exist Mill is consistent enough to show on the contrary that it has no existence even 
when it does exist 

And even in the former case when the workman is a wage labourer to whom 
the capitalist advances all the necessaries of life he the labourer may be looked 
upon in the same light ie as a capitalist since contributing his labour at less 
than the marketprice  he may be regarded as lending the difference  to his 
employer and receiving it back with interest c  

In reality the labourer advances his labour gratuitously to the capitalist during say one week in 
order to receive the market price at the end of the week c and it is this which according to 
Mill transforms him into a capitalist On the level plain simple mounds look like hills and the 
imbecile flatness of the present bourgeoisie is to be measured by the altitude of its great intellects

Chapter  Changes of Magnitude in the Price 

of LabourPower and in SurplusValue 

The  value  of  labourpower  is  determined  by  the  value  of  the  necessaries  of  life  habitually 
required by the average labourer The quantity of these necessaries is known at any given epoch 
of a given society and can therefore be treated as a constant magnitude What changes is the 
value of this quantity There are besides two other factors that enter into the determination of the 
value of labourpower One the expenses of developing that power which expenses vary with the 
mode of production the other its natural diversity the difference between the labourpower of 
men  and  women  of  children  and  adults  The  employment  of  these  different  sorts  of  labour
power an employment which is in its turn made necessary by the mode of production makes a 
great  difference  in  the  cost  of  maintaining  the  family  of  the  labourer  and  in  the  value  of  the 
labourpower  of  the  adult  male  Both  these  factors  however  are  excluded  in  the  following 
investigation  
I  assume    that  commodities  are  sold  at their  value    that  the  price  of  labourpower  rises 
occasionally above its value but never sinks below it  
On this assumption we have seen that the relative magnitudes of surplusvalue and of price of 
labourpower are determined by three circumstances  the length of the working day or the 
extensive  magnitude  of  labour    the  normal  intensity  of  labour  its  intensive  magnitude 
whereby a given quantity of labour is expended in a given time  the productiveness of labour 
whereby the same quantum of labour yields in a given time a greater or less quantum of product 
dependent  on  the  degree  of  development  in  the  conditions  of  production  Very  different 
combinations  are  clearly  possible  according  as  one  of  the  three  factors  is  constant  and  two 
variable or two constant and one variable or lastly all three simultaneously variable And the 
number of these combinations is augmented by the fact that when these factors simultaneously 
vary the amount and direction of their respective variations may differ In what follows the chief 
combinations alone are considered  
Section  Length of the Working day and Intensity of Labour 

Constant Productiveness of Labour Variable 

On  these  assumptions  the  value  of  labourpower  and  the  magnitude  of  surplusvalue  are 
determined by three laws  
 A working day of given length always creates the same amount of value no matter how the 
productiveness  of  labour  and  with  it  the  mass  of  the  product  and  the  price  of  each  single 
commodity produced may vary  
If the value created by a working day of  hours be say six shillings then although the mass of 
the articles produced varies with the productiveness of labour the only result is that the value 
represented by six shillings is spread over a greater or less number of articles  
 Surplusvalue and the value of labourpower vary in opposite directions A variation in the 
productiveness of labour its increase or diminution causes a variation in the opposite direction in 
the value of labourpower and in the same direction in surplusvalue  
The value created by a working day of  hours is a constant quantity say six shillings This 
constant quantity is the sum of the surplusvalue plus the value of the labourpower which latter 

 

 

Chapter  
 
value the labourer replaces by an equivalent It is selfevident that if a constant quantity consists 
of  two  parts  neither  of  them  can  increase  without  the  other  diminishing  Let  the  two  parts  at 
starting be equal  shillings value of labourpower  shillings surplusvalue Then the value of 
the labourpower cannot rise from three shillings to four without the surplusvalue falling from 
three shillings to two and the surplusvalue cannot rise from three shillings to four without the 
value of labourpower falling from three shillings to two Under these circumstances therefore 
no change can take place in the absolute magnitude either of the surplusvalue or of the value of 
labourpower without a simultaneous change in their relative magnitudes ie relatively to each 
other It is impossible for them to rise or fall simultaneously  
Further  the  value  of  labourpower  cannot  fall  and  consequently  surplusvalue  cannot  rise 
without a rise in the productiveness of labour For instance in the above case the value of the 
labourpower cannot sink from three shillings to two unless an increase in the productiveness of 
labour  makes  it  possible to  produce  in    hours the same  quantity  of  necessaries  as  previously 
required  hours to produce On the other hand the value of the labourpower cannot rise from 
three shillings to four without a decrease in the productiveness of labour whereby eight hours 
become  requisite to produce the  same  quantity  of  necessaries  for the  production  of  which six 
hours previously sufficed It follows from this that an increase in the productiveness of labour 
causes a fall in the value of labourpower and a consequent rise in surplusvalue while on the 
other hand a decrease in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of labourpower and a 
fall in surplusvalue  
In  formulating  this  law  Ricardo  overlooked  one  circumstance  although  a  change  in  the 
magnitude of the surplusvalue or surplus labour causes a change in the opposite direction in the 
magnitude of the value of labourpower or in the quantity of necessary labour it by no means 
follows that they vary in the same proportion They do increase or diminish by the same quantity 
But  their  proportional  increase  or  diminution  depends  on  their  original  magnitudes  before  the 
change in the productiveness of labour took place If the value of the labourpower be  shillings 
or the necessary labour time  hours and the surplusvalue be  shillings or the surplus labour  
hours  and  if  in  consequence  of  an  increase  in  the  productiveness  of  labour  the  value  of  the 
labourpower fall to  shillings or the necessary labour to  hours the surplusvalue will rise to  
shillings or the surplus labour to  hours The same quantity  shilling or  hours is added in 
one case and subtracted in the other But the proportional change of magnitude is different in each 
case While the  value  of  the  labourpower  falls  from    shillings  to   ie by    or    the 
surplusvalue  rises  from    shillings  to    ie  by    or    It  therefore  follows  that  the 
proportional  increase  or  diminution  in  surplusvalue  consequent  on  a  given  change  in  the 
productiveness of labour depends on the original magnitude of that portion of the working day 
which embodies itself in surplusvalue the smaller that portion the greater is the proportional 
change the greater that portion the less is the proportional change  
 Increase or diminution in surplusvalue is always consequent on and never the cause of the 
corresponding diminution or increase in the value of labourpower  
Since  the  working  day  is  constant  in  magnitude  and  is  represented  by  a  value  of  constant 
magnitude  since  to  every  variation  in  the  magnitude  of  surplusvalue  there  corresponds  an 
inverse  variation  in  the  value  of  labourpower  and  since  the  value  of  labourpower  cannot 
change  except in consequence  of  a change in  the  productiveness  of labour it clearly follows 
under these conditions that every change of magnitude in surplusvalue arises from an inverse 
change of magnitude in the value of labourpower If then as we have already seen there can be 
no  change  of  absolute  magnitude  in  the  value  of  labourpower  and  in  surplusvalue 
unaccompanied by a change in their relative magnitudes so now it follows that no change in their 

 

 

Chapter  
 
relative magnitudes is possible without a previous change in the absolute magnitude of the value 
of labourpower  
According to the third law a change in the magnitude of surplusvalue presupposes a movement 
in  the  value  of  labourpower  which  movement  is  brought  about  by  a  variation  in  the 
productiveness of labour The limit of this change is given by the altered value of labourpower 
Nevertheless  even  when  circumstances  allow  the  law  to  operate  subsidiary  movements  may 
occur  For  example  if  in consequence  of  the increased  productiveness  of  labour  the  value  of 
labourpower falls from  shillings to  or the necessary labour time from  hours to  the price 
of labourpower may possibly not fall below s d s d or s d and the surplusvalue 
consequently not rise above s d s d or s d The amount of this fall the lowest limit of 
which is  shillings the new value of labourpower depends on the relative weight which the 
pressure of capital on the one side and the resistance of the labourer on the other throws into the 
scale  
The value of labourpower is determined by the value of a given quantity of necessaries It is the 
value and not the mass of these necessaries that varies with the productiveness of labour It is 
however  possible  that  owing  to  an  increase  of  productiveness  both  the  labourer  and  the 
capitalist  may  simultaneously  be  able  to  appropriate  a  greater  quantity  of  these  necessaries 
without any change in the price of labourpower or in surplusvalue If the value of labourpower 
be  shillings and the necessary labour time amount to  hours if the surplusvalue likewise be  
shillings  and  the  surplus  labour    hours  then  if  the  productiveness  of  labour  were  doubled 
without  altering  the  ratio  of  necessary  labour  to  surplus  labour  there  would  be  no  change  of 
magnitude in surplusvalue and price of labourpower The only result would be that each of them 
would represent twice as many usevalues as before these usevalues being twice as cheap as 
before  Although  labourpower  would  be  unchanged  in  price  it  would  be  above  its  value  If 
however the price of labourpower had fallen not to s d the lowest possible point consistent 
with its new value but to s d or s d still this lower price would represent an increased 
mass of necessaries In this way it is possible with an increasing productiveness of labour for the 
price of labourpower to keep on falling and yet this fall to be accompanied by a constant growth 
in the mass of the labourers means of subsistence But even in such case the fall in the value of 
labourpower would cause a corresponding rise of surplusvalue and thus the abyss between the 
labourers position and that of the capitalist would keep widening 
Ricardo was the first who accurately formulated the three laws we have above stated But he falls 
into the following errors  he looks upon the special conditions under which these laws hold 
good as the general and sole conditions of capitalist production He knows no change either in 
the length of the working day or in the intensity of labour consequently with him there can be 
only one variable factor viz the productiveness of labour  and this error vitiates his analysis 
much more than  he has not any more than have the other economists investigated surplus
value as such ie independently of its particular forms such as profit rent c He therefore 
confounds together the laws of the rate of surplusvalue and the laws of the rate of profit The rate 
of profit is as we have already said the ratio of the surplusvalue to the total capital advanced 
the  rate  of  surplusvalue  is  the  ratio  of  the  surplusvalue  to  the  variable  part  of  that  capital 
Assume that a capital C of  is made up of raw material instruments of labour c c to the 
amount of  and of wages v to the amount of  and further that the surplusvalue s  
 Then we have rate of surplusvalue sv     But the rate of profit sc  
   It is besides obvious that the rate of profit may depend on circumstances that 
in no way affect the rate of surplusvalue I shall show in Book  III that with a given rate of 

 

Chapter  
 
surplusvalue we may have any number of rates of profit and that various rates of surplusvalue 
may under given conditions express themselves in a single rate of profit  

 

Section  Working day Constant Productiveness of Labour 

Constant Intensity of Labour Variable 

Increased  intensity  of  labour  means  increased  expenditure  of  labour  in  a  given  time  Hence  a 
working  day  of  more  intense  labour is  embodied  in  more  products than  is  one  of  less  intense 
labour the length of each day being the same Increased productiveness of labour also it is true 
will supply more products in a given working day But in this latter case the value of each single 
product  falls  for  it  costs  less  labour  than  before  in  the  former  case  that  value  remains 
unchanged  for  each  article  costs  the  same  labour  as  before  Here  we  have  an  increase  in  the 
number of products unaccompanied by a fall in their individual prices as their number increases 
so  does  the  sum  of  their  prices  But  in  the  case  of  increased  productiveness  a  given  value  is 
spread over a greater mass of products Hence the length of the working day being constant a 
days labour of increased intensity will be incorporated in an increased value and the value of 
money remaining unchanged in more money The value created varies with the extent to which 
the intensity of labour deviates from its normal intensity in the society A given working day 
therefore  no longer  creates  a  constant  but  a  variable  value  in  a  day  of    hours  of  ordinary 
intensity the value created is say  shillings but with increased intensity the value created may 
be   or more shillings It is clear that if the value created by a days labour increases from 
say  to  shillings then the two parts into which this value is divided viz price of labourpower 
and surplusvalue may both of them increase simultaneously and either equally or unequally 
They may both simultaneously increase from  shillings to  Here the rise in the price of labour
power does not necessarily imply that the price has risen above the value of labourpower On the 
contrary the rise in price may be accompanied by a fall in value This occurs whenever the rise in 
the price of labourpower does not compensate for its increased wear and tear  
We know that with transitory exceptions a change in the productiveness of labour does not cause 
any  change  in  the  value  of  labourpower  nor consequently  in the  magnitude of  surplusvalue 
unless the products of the industries affected are articles habitually consumed by the labourers In 
the present case this condition no longer applies For when the variation is either in the duration 
or in the intensity of labour there is always a corresponding change in the magnitude of the value 
created independently of the nature of the article in which that value is embodied  
If the intensity of labour were to increase simultaneously and equally in every branch of industry 
then the new and higher degree of intensity would become the normal degree for the society and 
would therefore cease to be taken account of But still even then the intensity of labour would be 
different  in  different  countries  and  would  modify  the  international  application  of  the  law  of 
value The more intense working day of one nation would be represented by a greater sum of 
money than would the less intense day of another nation 

Section   Productiveness and Intensity of Labour Constant 

Length of the Working day Variable 

The  working  day  may  vary  in  two  ways  It  may  be  made  either  longer  or  shorter  From  our 
present data and within the limits of the assumptions made above we obtain the following laws 
 The working day creates a greater or less amount of value in proportion to its length  thus a 
variable and not a constant quantity of value 

 

 

Chapter  
 
 Every change in the relation between the magnitudes of surplusvalue and of the value of 
labourpower  arises  from  a  change  in  the  absolute  magnitude  of  the  surplus  labour  and 
consequently of the surplusvalue 
 The absolute value of labourpower can change only in consequence of the reaction exercised 
by the prolongation of surplus labour upon the wear and tear of labourpower Every change in 
this absolute value is therefore the effect but never the cause of a change in the magnitude of 
surplusvalue 
We begin with the case in which the working day is shortened 
  A  shortening  of  the  working  day  under  the  conditions  given  above  leaves  the  value  of 
labourpower and with it the necessary labour time unaltered It reduces the surplus labour and 
surplusvalue Along with the absolute magnitude of the latter its relative magnitude also falls 
ie its magnitude relatively to the value of labourpower whose magnitude remains unaltered 
Only  by  lowering  the  price  of  labourpower  below  its  value  could  the  capitalist  save  himself 
harmless  
All  the  usual  arguments  against  the  shortening  of  the  working  day  assume  that  it  takes  place 
under the conditions we have here supposed to exist but in reality the very contrary is the case a 
change in the productiveness and intensity of labour either precedes or immediately follows a 
shortening of the working day 
 Lengthening of the working day Let the necessary labour time be  hours or the value of 
labourpower  shillings also let the surplus labour be  hours or the surplusvalue  shillings 
The whole working day then amounts to  hours and is embodied in a value of  shillings If 
now the working day be lengthened by  hours and the price of labourpower remain unaltered 
the surplusvalue increases both absolutely and relatively Although there is no absolute change in 
the value of labourpower it suffers a relative fall Under the conditions assumed in  there could 
not  be  a  change  of  relative  magnitude  in  the  value  of  labourpower  without  a  change  in  its 
absolute  magnitude  Here  on  the  contrary  the  change  of  relative  magnitude  in  the  value  of 
labourpower is the result of the change of absolute magnitude in surplusvalue 
Since the value in which a days labour is embodied increases with the length of that day it is 
evident that the surplusvalue and the price of labourpower may simultaneously increase either 
by equal or unequal quantities This simultaneous increase is therefore possible in two cases one 
the  actual  lengthening  of  the  working  day  the  other  an  increase  in  the  intensity  of  labour 
unaccompanied by such lengthening  
When the working day is prolonged the price of labourpower may fall below its value although 
that price be nominally unchanged or even rise The value of a days labourpower is as will be 
remembered  estimated  from  its  normal  average  duration  or  from  the  normal  duration  of  life 
among the labourers and from corresponding normal transformations of organised bodily matter 
into motion in conformity with the nature of man Up to a certain point the increased wear and 
tear of labourpower inseparable from a lengthened working day may be compensated by higher 
wages But beyond this point the wear and tear increases in geometrical progression and every 
condition  suitable  for  the  normal  reproduction  and  functioning  of  labourpower  is  suppressed 
The  price  of  labourpower  and  the  degree  of  its  exploitation  cease  to  be  commensurable 
quantities 

 

 

 

Chapter  

Section  Simultaneous Variations in the Duration 

Productiveness and Intensity of Labour 

It is obvious that a large number of combinations are here possible Any two of the factors may 
vary and the third remain constant or all three may vary at once They may vary either in the 
same  or  in  different  degrees  in  the  same  or  in  opposite  directions  with  the  result  that  the 
variations  counteract  one  another  either  wholly  or  in  part  Nevertheless  the  analysis  of  every 
possible case is easy in view of the results given in I II and III The effect of every possible 
combination may be found by treating each factor in turn as variable and the other two constant 
for the time being We shall therefore notice and that briefly but two important cases 

A Diminishing Productiveness of Labour with a 
Simultaneous Lengthening of the Working day 

In  speaking  of  diminishing  productiveness  of  labour  we  here  refer  to  diminution  in  those 
industries whose products determine the value of labourpower such a diminution for example 
as  results  from  decreasing  fertility  of  the  soil  and  from  the  corresponding  dearness  of  its 
products Take the working day at  hours and the value created by it at  shillings of which one 
half  replaces  the  value  of  the  labourpower  the  other  forms  the  surplusvalue  Suppose  in 
consequence of the increased dearness of the products of the soil that the value of labourpower 
rises from  shillings to  and therefore the necessary labour time from  hours to  If there be 
no change in the length of the working day the surplus labour would fall from  hours to  the 
surplusvalue from  shillings to  If the day be lengthened by  hours ie from  hours to  
the  surplus  labour  remains  at    hours  the  surplusvalue  at    shillings  but  the  surplusvalue 
decreases compared with the value of labourpower as measured by the necessary labour time If 
the  day  be  lengthened  by    hours  viz  from    hours  to    the  proportional  magnitudes  of 
surplusvalue  and  value  of  labourpower  of  surplus  labour  and  necessary  labour  continue 
unchanged but the absolute magnitude of surplusvalue rises from  shillings to  that of the 
surplus  labour  from    hours  to    an  increment  of      Therefore  with  diminishing 
productiveness  of  labour  and  a  simultaneous  lengthening  of  the  working  day  the  absolute 
magnitude of surplusvalue may continue unaltered at the same time that its relative magnitude 
diminishes  its  relative  magnitude  may  continue  unchanged  at  the  same  time  that  its  absolute 
magnitude increases and provided the lengthening of the day be sufficient both may increase  
In  the  period  between    and    the  increasing  price  of  provisions  led  in  England  to  a 
nominal rise in wages although the real wages expressed in the necessaries of life fell From this 
fact  West  and  Ricardo  drew  the  conclusion  that  the  diminution  in  the  productiveness  of 
agricultural  labour  had  brought  about  a  fall  in  the  rate  of  surplusvalue  and  they  made  this 
assumption  of  a  fact  that  existed  only  in  their  imaginations  the  startingpoint  of  important 
investigations into the relative magnitudes of wages profits and rent But as a matter of fact 
surplusvalue had at that time thanks to the increased intensity of labour and to the prolongation 
of the working day increased both in absolute and relative magnitude This was the period in 
which  the  right  to  prolong  the  hours  of  labour  to  an  outrageous  extent  was  established    the 
period  that  was  especially  characterised  by  an  accelerated  accumulation  of  capital  here  by 
pauperism there  

                                                      
 Earlier English translations have  sh instead of  shillings This error was pointed out to us by a reader we have 
investigated and checked with the  German Edition and duly corrected an obvious error 
 

 

 

Chapter  

B Increasing Intensity and Productiveness of Labour with 

Simultaneous Shortening of the Working day 

Increased  productiveness  and  greater  intensity  of  labour  both  have  a  like  effect  They  both 
augment the mass of articles produced in a given time Both therefore shorten that portion of the 
working day which the labourer needs to produce his means of subsistence or their equivalent 
The minimum length of the working day is fixed by this necessary but contractile portion of it If 
the whole working day were to shrink to the length of this portion surplus labour would vanish a 
consummation utterly impossible under the rgime of capital Only by suppressing the capitalist 
form of production could the length of the working day be reduced to the necessary labour time 
But even in that case the latter would extend its limits On the one hand because the notion of 
means  of  subsistence  would  considerably  expand  and  the  labourer  would  lay  claim  to  an 
altogether different standard of life On the other hand because a part of what is now surplus 
labour would then count as necessary labour I mean the labour of forming a fund for reserve and 
accumulation 
The more the productiveness of labour increases the more can the working day be shortened and 
the  more  the  working  day  is  shortened  the  more  can  the  intensity  of  labour  increase  From  a 
social point of view the productiveness increases in the same ratio as the economy of labour 
which in its turn includes not only economy of the means of production but also the avoidance 
of  all  useless  labour  The  capitalist  mode  of  production  while  on  the  one  hand  enforcing 
economy  in  each  individual  business  on  the  other  hand  begets  by  its  anarchical  system  of 
competition  the  most  outrageous  squandering  of  labourpower  and  of  the  social  means  of 
production  not  to  mention  the  creation  of  a  vast  number  of  employments  at  present 
indispensable but in themselves superfluous 
The intensity and productiveness of labour being given the time which society is bound to devote 
to  material  production  is  shorter  and  as  a  consequence  the  time  at  its  disposal  for  the  free 
development intellectual and social of the individual is greater in proportion as the work is more 
and more evenly divided among all the ablebodied members of society and as a particular class 
is  more  and  more  deprived  of  the  power  to  shift  the  natural  burden  of  labour  from  its  own 
shoulders to those of another layer of society In this direction the shortening of the working day 
finds at last a limit in the generalisation of labour In capitalist society spare time is acquired for 
one  class  by  converting 
time 
                                                      
 Note in the rd German edition  The case considered at pages  is here of course omitted 
 F E 
 To this third law MacCulloch has made amongst others this absurd addition that a rise in surplus
value unaccompanied by a fall in the value of labourpower can occur through the abolition of taxes 
payable by the capitalist The abolition of such taxes makes no change whatever in the quantity of 
surplusvalue that the capitalist extorts at firsthand from the labourer It alters only the proportion in 
which  that  surplusvalue  is  divided  between  himself  and  third  persons  It  consequently  makes  no 
alteration  whatever  in  the  relation  between  surplusvalue  and  value  of  labourpower  MacCullochs 
exception therefore proves only his misapprehension of the rule a misfortune that as often happens to 
him in the vulgarisation of Ricardo as it does to J B Say in the vulgarisation of Adam Smith 
 When an alteration takes place in the productiveness of industry and that either more or  less is 
produced  by  a  given  quantity  of  labour  and  capital  the  proportion  of  wages  may  obviously  vary 
whilst  the  quantity  which  that  proportion  represents  remains  the  same  or  the  quantity  may  vary

 All things being equal the English manufacturer can turn out a considerably larger amount of work 
in  a  given  time  than  a  foreign  manufacturer  so  much  as  to  counterbalance  the  difference  of  the 
working days between  hours a week here and  or  elsewhere Rep of Insp of Fact for st

honour to Malthus that he lays stress on the lengthening of the hours of labour a fact to which he 
elsewhere in his pamphlet draws attention while Ricardo and others in face of the most notorious 
facts make invariability in the length of the working day the groundwork of all their investigations 
But  the  conservative  interests  which  Malthus  served  prevented  him  from  seeing  that  an unlimited 
prolongation of the working day combined with an extraordinary development of machinery and the 
exploitation of women and children must inevitably have made a great portion of the workingclass 
supernumerary particularly whenever the war should have ceased and the monopoly of England in 
the markets of the  world should have come to an end  It was of course far  more  convenient and 
much more in conformity with the interests of the ruling classes whom Malthus adored like a true 
priest to explain this overpopulation by the eternal  laws of Nature rather than by the historical 
laws of capitalist production 
 A principal cause of the increase of capital during the war proceeded from the greater exertions 
and perhaps the greater privations of the labouring classes the most numerous in every society More 
women  and  children  were  compelled  by  necessitous  circumstances  to  enter  upon  laborious 
occupations and former workmen were from the same cause obliged to devote a greater portion of 
their time to increase production Essays on Pol Econ in which are illustrated the principal causes

Chapter  Various Formula for the rate of 

SurplusValue 

We have seen that the rate of surplusvalue is represented by the following formulae 

I 

Surplusvalue   s   

Variable Capital 

v 

Surplusvalue 

Surpluslabour 
Value of labourpower  Necessary labour 

 

Working day 

 

Surplusvalue 

Value of the Product 

  Surplusproduct 
Total Product 

The  two  first  of  these  formulae  represent  as  a  ratio  of  values  that  which  in  the  third  is 
represented  as  a  ratio  of  the  times  during  which  those  values  are  produced  These  formulae 
supplementary the one to the other are rigorously definite and correct We therefore find them 
substantially but not consciously worked out in classical Political Economy There we meet with 
the following derivative formulae 
II  Surpluslabour         
One and the same ratio is here expressed as a ratio of labourtimes of the values in which those 
labourtimes  are  embodied  and  of  the  products  in  which  those  values  exist  It  is  of  course 
understood that by Value of the Product is meant only the value newly created in a working 
day the constant part of the value of the product being excluded  
In all of these formulae II the actual degree of exploitation of labour or the rate of surplus
value is falsely expressed Let the working day be  hours Then making the same assumptions 
as  in  former  instances  the  real  degree  of  exploitation  of  labour  will  be  represented  in  the 
following proportions  
 hours surpluslabour   
 hours necessary labour 
From formulae II we get very differently 

Surplusvalue of  sh    
Variable Capital of  sh 

Value created of  sh 

  Surplusvalue of  sh    

 hours surpluslabour 
Working day of  hours 
These derivative formulae express in reality only the proportion in which the working day or 
the value produced by it is divided between capitalist and labourer If they are to be treated as 
direct expressions of the degree of selfexpansion of capital the following erroneous law would 
hold good Surpluslabour or surplusvalue can never reach  Since the surpluslabour is 
only an aliquot part of the working day or since surplusvalue is only an aliquot part of the value 
created the surpluslabour must necessarily be always less than the working day or the surplus
value always less than the total value created In order however to attain the ratio of  
they must be equal In order that the surpluslabour may absorb the whole day ie an average 
day of any week or  year the necessary labour must sink to zero But if the necessary labour 
vanish so too does the surpluslabour since it is only a function of the former The ratio 
Surpluslabour or  Surplusvalue 
Working day 
  Value created 
can therefore never reach the limit  still less rise to   x But not so the rate of 
surplusvalue the real degree of exploitation of labour Take eg the estimate of L de Lavergne 
according to which the English agricultural labourer gets only  the capitalist farmer on the 
other  hand    of  the  product    or  its  value  apart  from  the  question  of  how  the  booty  is 
 

 

Chapter  
 
subsequently  divided  between  the  capitalist  the  landlord  and  others  According  to  this  this 
surpluslabour of the English agricultural labourer is to his necessary labour as  which gives a 
rate of exploitation of   
The favorite method of treating the working day as constant in magnitude became through the 
use  of  formulae  II  a  fixed  usage  because  in  them  surpluslabour  is  always  compared  with  a 
working day of given length The same holds good when the repartition of the value produced is 
exclusively kept in sight The working day that has already been realized in given value must 
necessarily be a day of given length  
The  habit  of  representing  surplusvalue  and  value  of  labourpower  as  fractions  of  the  value 
created  a habit that originates in the capitalist mode of production itself and whose import will 
hereafter  be  disclosed    conceals  the  very  transaction  that  characterizes  capital  namely  the 
exchange of variable capital for living labourpower and the consequent exclusion of the labourer 
from the product Instead of the real fact we have false semblance of an association in which 
labourer  and  capitalist  divide  the  product  in  proportion  to  the  different  elements  which  they 
respectively contribute towards its formation  
Moreover the formulae II can at any time be reconverted into formulae I If for instance we 
have 

Surpluslabour of  hours 
Working day of  hours 

then  the  necessary  labourtime  being    hours  less  the  surpluslabour  of    hours  we  get  the 
following result  
Surpluslabour of  hours     
Necessary labour of  hours 
 
There is a third formula which I have occasionally already anticipated it is 
Surpluslabour    Unpaid labour 
Necessary labour 
Paid labour 

Value of labourpower 

III 

Surplusvalue 

 

After the investigations we have given above it is no longer possible to be misled by the formula 

Unpaid labour 

Paid labour 

into concluding that the capitalist pays for labour and not for labourpower This formula is only 
a popular expression for 

Surpluslabour 
Necessary labour 

The  capitalist  pays  the  value  so  far  as  price  coincides  with  value  of  the  labourpower  and 
receives in exchange the disposal of the living labourpower itself His usufruct is spread over 
two  periods  During  one  the  labourer  produces  a  value  that  is  only  equal  to  the  value  of  his 
labourpower he produces its equivalent This the capitalist receives in return for his advance of 
the price of the labourpower a product ready made in the market During the other period the 
period of surpluslabour the usufruct of the labourpower creates a value for the capitalist that 
costs him no equivalent This expenditure of labourpower comes to him gratis In this sense it is 
that surpluslabour can be called unpaid labour  
Capital therefore it not only as Adam Smith says the command over labour It is essentially the 
command  over  unpaid  labour  All  surplusvalue  whatever  particular  form  profit  interest  or

acknowledgement by Marx wants restricting to some extent In those letters this passage occurs  
Capital must be rescued not only from labor but from itself and that will be best effected by treating 
the acts of the industrial capitalist as economic and political functions that have been delegated to him 
with his capital and by treating his profit as a form of salary because we still know no other social 
organisation  But  salaries  may  be  regulated  and  may  also  be  reduced  if  they  take  too  much  from 
wages The irruption of Marx into Society as I may call his book must be warded off Altogether

Chapter  The Transformation of the Value 
and Respective Price of LabourPower into 

Wages 

On the surface of bourgeois society the wage of the labourer appears as the price of labour a 
certain quantity of money that is paid for a certain quantity of labour Thus people speak of the 
value of labour and call its expression in money its necessary or natural price On the other hand 
they speak of the marketprices of labour ie prices oscillating above or below its natural price  
But what is the value of a commodity The objective form of the social labour expended in its 
production And how do we measure the quantity of this value By the quantity of the labour 
contained in it How then is the value eg of a  hour workingday to be determined By the  
workinghours contained in a working day of  hours which is an absurd tautology  
In order to be sold as a commodity in the market labour must at all events exist before it is sold 
But could the labourer give it an independent objective existence he would sell a commodity and 
not labour  
Apart from these contradictions a direct exchange of money ie of realized labour with living 
labour would either do away with the law of value which only begins to develop itself freely on 
the basis of capitalist production or do away with capitalist production itself which rests directly 
on wagelabour The working day of  hours embodies itself eg in a moneyvalue of s Either 
equivalents are exchanged and then the labourer receives s for  hours labour the price of his 
labour would be equal to the price of his product In this case he produces no surplusvalue for 
the buyer of his labour the s are not transformed into capital the basis of capitalist production 
vanishes But it is on this very basis that he sells his labour and that his labour is wagelabour Or 
else he receives for  hours labour less than s ie less than  hours labour Twelve hours 
labour are exchanged against   c hours labour This equalisation of unequal quantities not 
merely does away with the determination of value Such a selfdestructive contradiction cannot be 
in any way even enunciated or formulated as a law 
It is of no avail to deduce the exchange of more labour against less from their difference of form 
the one being realized the other living This is the more absurd as the value of a commodity is 
determined  not  by  the  quantity  of  labour  actually  realized  in  it  but  by  the  quantity  of  living 
labour  necessary  for  its  production  A  commodity  represents  say    workinghours  If  an 
invention  is  made  by  which  it  can  be  produced in    hours the  value  even  of the  commodity 
already  produced  falls  by  half  It  represents  now    hours  of  social  labour  instead  of  the   
formerly necessary It is the quantity of labour required for its production not the realized form of 
that labour by which the amount of the value of a commodity is determined  
That which comes directly face to face with the possessor of money on the market is in fact not 
labour but the labourer What the latter sells is his labourpower As soon as his labour actually 
begins it has already ceased to belong to him it can therefore no longer be sold by him Labour 
is the substance and the immanent measure of value but has itself no value 
In  the  expression  value  of  labour  the  idea  of  value  is  not  only  completely  obliterated  but 
actually  reversed  It  is  an  expression  as  imaginary  as  the  value  of  the  earth  These  imaginary 
expressions arise however from the relations of production themselves They are categories for 
the  phenomenal  forms  of  essential  relations  That  in  their  appearance  things  often  represent 
themselves in inverted form is pretty well known in every science except Political Economy  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Classical Political Economy borrowed from everyday life the category price of labour without 
further  criticism  and  then  simply  asked  the  question  how  is  this  price  determined  It  soon 
recognized that the change in the relations of demand and supply explained in regard to the price 
of  labour  as  of  all  other  commodities  nothing  except  its  changes  ie  the  oscillations  of  the 
marketprice  above  or  below  a  certain  mean  If  demand  and  supply  balance the  oscillation  of 
prices ceases all other conditions remaining the same But then demand and supply also cease to 
explain anything The price of labour at the moment when demand and supply are in equilibrium 
is its natural price determined independently of the relation of demand and supply And how this 
price is determined is just the question Or a larger period of oscillations in the marketprice is 
taken eg a year and they are found to cancel one the other leaving a mean average quantity a 
relatively  constant  magnitude  This  had  naturally  to  be  determined  otherwise  than  by  its  own 
compensating  variations  This  price  which  always  finally  predominates  over  the  accidental 
marketprices of labour and regulates them this necessary price Physiocrats or natural price 
of  labour  Adam  Smith  can  as  with  all  other  commodities  be  nothing  else  than  its  value 
expressed in money In this way Political Economy expected to penetrate athwart the accidental 
prices of labour to the value of labour As with other commodities this value was determined by 
the  cost  of  production  But  what  is  the  cost  of  production    of  the  labourer  ie  the  cost  of 
producing or reproducing the labourer himself This question unconsciously substituted itself in 
Political Economy for the original one for the search after the cost of production of labour as 
such turned in a circle and never left the spot What economists therefore call value of labour is 
in  fact  the  value  of  labourpower  as  it  exists  in  the  personality  of  the  labourer  which  is  as 
different from its function labour as a machine is from the work it performs Occupied with the 
difference  between the  marketprice  of labour  and  its  socalled  value  with  the  relation  of this 
value to the rate of profit and to the values of the commodities produced by means of labour 
c they never discovered that the course of the analysis had led not only from the marketprices 
of labour to its presumed value but had led to the resolution of this value of labour itself into the 
value of labourpower Classical economy never arrived at a consciousness of the results of its 
own analysis it accepted uncritically the categories value of labour natural price of labour 
c as final and as adequate expressions for the valuerelation under consideration and was thus 
led  as  will  be seen later into  inextricable  confusion  and  contradiction  while it  offered  to the 
vulgar economists a secure basis of operations for their shallowness which on principle worships 
appearances only  
Let us next see how value and price of labourpower present themselves in this transformed 
condition as wages  
We know that the daily value of labourpower is calculated upon a certain length of the labourers 
life to which again corresponds a certain length of working day Assume the habitual working 
day as  hours the daily value of labourpower as s the expression in money of a value that 
embodies  hours of labour If the labourer receives s then he receives the value of his labour
power functioning through  hours If now this value of a days labourpower is expressed as 
the value of a days labour itself we have the formula Twelve hours labour has a value of s 
The  value  of  labourpower  thus  determines  the  value  of  labour  or  expressed  in  money  its 
necessary price If on the other hand the price of labourpower differs from its value in like 
manner the price of labour differs from its socalled value  
As the value of labour is only an irrational expression for the value of labourpower it follows of 
course that the value of labour must always be less than the value it produces for the capitalist 
always makes labourpower work longer than is necessary for the reproduction of its own value 
In  the  above  example  the  value  of  the  labourpower  that  functions  through    hours is  s a 

 

 

Chapter  
 
value  for  the  reproduction  of  which    hours  are  required  The  value  which  the  labourpower 
produces is on the other hand s because it in fact functions during  hours and the value it 
produces depends not on its own value but on the length of time it is in action Thus we have a 
result absurd at first sight that labour which creates a value of s possesses a value of s  
We see further The value of s by which a part only of the working day  ie  hours labouris 
paid for appears as the value or price of the whole working day of  hours which thus includes 
 hours unpaid for The wage form thus extinguishes every trace of the division of the working 
day into necessary labour and surplus labour into paid and unpaid labour All labour appears as 
paid labour In the corve the labour of the worker for himself and his compulsory labour for his 
lord differ in space and time in the clearest possible way In slave labour even that part of the 
working  day  in  which  the slave is only  replacing  the  value of  his  own  means of  existence  in 
which therefore in fact he works for himself alone appears as labour for his master All the 
slaves labour appears as unpaid labour In wage labour on the contrary even surplus labour or 
unpaid labour appears as paid There the propertyrelation conceals the labour of the slave for 
himself here the moneyrelation conceals the unrequited labour of the wage labourer  
Hence we may understand the decisive importance of the transformation of value and price of 
labourpower into the form of wages or into the value and price of labour itself This phenomenal 
form which makes the actual relation invisible and indeed shows the direct opposite of that 
relation  forms  the  basis  of  all  the  juridical  notions  of  both  labourer  and  capitalist  of  all  the 
mystifications of the capitalistic mode of production of all its illusions as to liberty of all the 
apologetic shifts of the vulgar economists  
If history took a long time to get at the bottom of the mystery of wages nothing on the other 
hand is more easy to understand than the necessity the raison detre of this phenomenon  
The exchange between capital and labour at first presents itself to the mind in the same guise as 
the buying and selling of all other commodities The buyer gives a certain sum of money the 
seller an article of a nature different from money The jurists consciousness recognizes in this at 
most  a  material  difference  expressed  in  the  juridically  equivalent  formula  Do  ut  des  do  ut 
facias facio ut des facio ut facias  
Furthermore exchangevalue and usevalue being intrinsically incommensurable magnitudes the 
expressions value of labour price of labour do not seem more irrational than the expressions 
value of cotton price of cotton Moreover the labourer is paid after he has given his labour 
In its function of means of payment money realizes subsequently the value or price of the article 
supplied  ie in this particular case the value or price of the labour supplied Finally the use
value supplied by the labourer to the capitalist is not in fact his labourpower but its function 
some  definite  useful  labour  the  work  of  tailoring  shoemaking  spinning  c  That  this  same 
labour is on the other hand the universal valuecreating element and thus possesses a property 
by which it differs from all other commodities is beyond the cognizance of the ordinary mind  
Let us put ourselves in the place of the labourer who receives for  hours labour say the value 
produced by  hours labour say s For him in fact his  hours labour is the means of buying 
the s The value of his labourpower may vary with the value of his usual means of subsistence 
from    to    shillings  or  from    to    shillings  or  if  the  value  of  his  labourpower  remains 
constant its price may in consequence of changing relations of demand and supply rise to s or 
fall to s He always gives  hours of labour Every change in the amount of the equivalent that 
he  receives  appears  to  him  therefore  necessarily  as  a  change  in  the  value  or  price  of  his   
hours work This circumstance misled Adam Smith who treated the working day as a constant 
quantity to the assertion that the value of labour is constant although the value of the means of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
subsistence may vary and the same working day therefore may represent itself in more or less 
money for the labourer  
Let us consider on the other hand the capitalist He wishes to receive as much labour as possible 
for  as  little  money  as  possible  Practically  therefore  the  only  thing  that  interests  him  is  the 
difference between the price of labourpower and the value which its function creates But then 
he  tries  to  buy  all  commodities  as  cheaply  as  possible  and  always  accounts  for  his  profit  by 
simple cheating by buying under and selling over the value Hence he never comes to see that 
if such a thing as the value of labour really existed and he really paid this value no capital would 
exist his money would not be turned into capital  
Moreover the actual movement of wages presents phenomena which seem to prove that not the 
value of labourpower is paid but the value of its function of labour itself We may reduce these 
phenomena to two great classes  Change of wages with the changing length of the working 
day One might as well conclude that not the value of a machine is paid but that of its working 
because it costs more to hire a machine for a week than for a day  The individual difference in 
the  wages  of  different  labourers  who  do  the  same  kind  of  work  We  find  this  individual 
difference but are not deceived by it in the system of slavery where frankly and openly without 
any  circumlocution  labourpower  itself  is  sold  Only  in  the  slave  system  the  advantage  of  a 
labourpower  above  the  average  and  the  disadvantage  of  a  labourpower  below  the  average 
affects the slaveowner in the wagelabour system it affects the labourer himself because his 
labourpower is in the one case sold by himself in the other by a third person  
For  the  rest  in  respect  to  the  phenomenal  form  value  and  price  of  labour  or  wages  as 
contrasted  with  the  essential  relation  manifested  therein  viz  the  value  and  price  of  labour
power  the  same  difference  holds  that  holds  in  respect  to  all  phenomena  and  their  hidden 
substratum The former appear directly and spontaneously as current modes of thought the latter 
must first be discovered by science Classical Political Economy nearly touches the true relation 
of things without however consciously formulating it This it cannot so long as it sticks in its 
bourgeois 
skin 
                                                      
 MrRicardo ingeniously enough avoids a difficulty which on a first view threatens to encumber his 
doctrine  that value depends on the quantity of labour employed in production If this principle is 
rigidly adhered to it follows that the value of labour depends on the quantity of labour employed in 
producing  it    which  is  evidently  absurd  By  a  dexterous  turn  therefore  Mr  Ricardo  makes  the 
value of labour depend on the quantity of labour required to produce wages or to give him the benefit 
of his own language he maintains that the value of labour is to be estimated by the quantity of labour 
required to produce wages by which he means the quantity of labour required to produce the money 
or commodities given to the labourer This is similar to saying that the value of cloth is estimated not 
by the quantity of labour bestowed on its production but by the quantity of labour bestowed on the 
production of the silver for which the cloth is exchanged  A Critical Dissertation on the Nature 
c of Value pp

 Treating labour as a commodity and capital the produce of labour as another then if the values of

 On the other hand the attempt to explain such expressions as merely poetic license only shows the 
impotence  of  the  analysis  Hence  in  answer  to Proudhons  phrase  Labour  is  called  value  not  as 
being a commodity itself but in view of the values supposed to be potentially embodied in it The 
value of labour is a figurative expression c I have remarked In labour commodity which is a 
frightful reality he Proudhon sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis The whole of existing society 
then  based  upon  labour  commodity  is  henceforth  based  upon  a  poetic  license  on  a  figurative 
expression  Does  society  desire  to  eliminate  all  the  inconveniences  which  trouble  it  it  has  only  to 
eliminate all the illsounding terms Let it change the language and for that it has only to address itself

in money And why has agriculture a value Answer Because one sets a price on it Therefore 
value is what a thing is worth and the land has its value because its value is expressed in money

Chapter  TimeWages 

Wages  themselves  again  take  many  forms  a  fact  not  recognizable  in  the  ordinary  economic 
treatises  which  exclusively  interested  in  the  material  side  of  the  question  neglect  every 
difference  of  form  An  exposition  of  all  these  forms  however  belongs  to  the  special  study  of 
wage labour not therefore to this work Still the two fundamental forms must be briefly worked 
out here  
The sale of labourpower as will be remembered takes place for a definite period of time The 
converted  form  under  which  the  daily  weekly  c  value  of  labourpower  presents  itself  is 
hence that of time wages therefore daywages c  
Next it is to be noted that the laws set forth in the th chapter on the changes in the relative 
magnitudes of price of labourpower and surplusvalue pass by a simple transformation of form 
into laws of wages Similarly the distinction between the exchangevalue of labour power and the 
sum of the necessaries of life into which this value is converted now reappears as the distinction 
between  nominal  and  real  wages  It  would  be  useless  to  repeat  here  with  regard  to  the 
phenomenal form what has been already worked out in the substantial form We limit ourselves 
therefore to a few points characteristic of timewages  
The sum of money  which the labourer receives for his daily or weekly labour forms the amount 
of his nominal wages or of his wages estimated in value But it is clear that according to the 
length of the working day that is according to the amount of actual labour daily supplied the 
same daily or weekly wage may represent very different prices of labour ie very different sums 
of money for the same quantity of labour We must therefore in considering timewages again 
distinguish between the sumtotal of the daily or weekly wages c and the price of labour How 
then to find this price ie the moneyvalue of a given quantity of labour The average price of 
labour  is  found  when  the  average  daily  value  of  the  labourpower  is  divided  by  the  average 
number of hours in the working day If eg the daily value of labourpower is  shillings the 
value  of  the  product  of    workinghours  and  if  the  working  day  is    hours  the  price  of   
working hour is  shillings  d The price of the workinghour thus found serves as the unit 
measure for the price of labour  
It follows therefore that the daily and weekly wages c  may remain the same although the 
price of labour falls constantly If eg the habitual working day is  hours and the daily value 
of  the  labourpower  s  the  price of the  workinghour  is    d  It  falls to  s  as soon  as  the 
working day rises to  hours to  d as soon as it rises to  hours Daily or weekly wages 
remain despite all this unchanged On the contrary the daily or weekly wages may rise although 
the price of labour remains constant or even falls If eg the working day is  hours and the 
daily value of labourpower  shillings the price of one workinghour is  d If the labourer in 
consequence of increase of trade works  hours the price of labour remaining the same his 
daily wage now rises to  shillings   d without any variation in the price of labour The same 
result might follow if instead of the extensive amount of labour its intensive amount increased 
The  rise  of  the  nominal  daily  or  weekly  wages  may  therefore  be  accompanied  by  a  price  of 
labour that remains stationary or falls The same holds as to the income of the labourers family 
as soon as the quantity of labour expended by the head of the family is increased by the labour of 
the  members  of  his  family  There  are  therefore  methods  of  lowering  the  price  of  labour 
independent of the reduction of the nominal daily or weekly wages  

 

 

Chapter  
 
As a general law it follows that given the amount of daily or weekly labour c the daily or 
weekly wages depend on the price of labour which itself varies either with the value of labour
power or with the difference between its price and its value Given on the other hand the price 
of labour the daily or weekly wages depend on the quantity of the daily or weekly labour  
The unitmeasure for timewages the price of the workinghour is the quotient of the value of a 
days labourpower divided by the number of hours of the average working day Let the latter be 
 hours and the daily value of labourpower  shillings the value of the product of  hours of 
labour Under these circumstances the price of a working hour is d the value produced in it is 
d If the labourer is now employed less than  hours or less than  days in the week eg only 
 or  hours he receives with this price of labour only s or s d a day As on our hypothesis 
he  must  work  on  the  average    hours  daily  in  order  to  produce  a  days  wage  corresponding 
merely to the value of his labour power as according to the same hypothesis he works only half 
of every hour for himself and half for the capitalist it is clear that he cannot obtain for himself 
the value of the product of  hours if he is employed less than  hours In previous chapters we 
saw the destructive consequences of overwork here we find the sources of the sufferings that 
result to the labourer from his insufficient employment  
If the hours wage is fixed so that the capitalist does not bind himself to pay a days or a weeks 
wage but only to pay wages for the hours during which he chooses to employ the labourer he 
can employ him for a shorter time than that which is originally the basis of the calculation of the 
hourwage or the unitmeasure of the price of labour Since this unit is determined by the ratio  

daily value of labourpower 

working day of a given number of hours 
it of course loses all meaning as soon as the working day ceases to contain a definite number of 
hours The connection between the paid and the unpaid labour is destroyed The capitalist can 
now wring from the labour a certain quantity of surplus labour without allowing him the labour
time  necessary  for  his  own  subsistence  He  can  annihilate  all  regularity  of  employment  and 
according  to  his  own  convenience  caprice  and  the  interest  of  the  moment  make  the  most 
enormous  overwork  alternate  with  relative  or  absolute  cessation  of  work  He  can  under  the 
pretense of paying the normal price of labour abnormally lengthen the working day without 
any corresponding compensation to the labourer Hence the perfectly rational revolt in  of 
the London labourers employed in the building trades against the attempt of the capitalists to 
impose on them this sort of wage by the hour The legal limitation of the working day puts an end 
to  such  mischief  although  not  of  course  to  the  diminution  of  employment  caused  by  the 
competition  of  machinery  by  changes  in  the  quality  of  the  labourers employed  and  by  crises 
partial or general  
With an increasing daily or weekly wage the price of labour may remain nominally constant and 
yet may fall below its normal level This occurs every time that the price of labour reckoned per 
workinghour remaining constant the working day is prolonged beyond its customary length If 
in the fraction  

daily value of labour power 

working day 

the denominator increases the numerator increases yet more rapidly The value of labourpower 
as dependent on its wear and tear increases with the duration of its functioning and in more rapid 
proportion than the increase of that duration In many branches of industry where timewage is 
the general rule without legal limits to the workingtime the habit has therefore spontaneously 
grown  up  of  regarding  the  working  day  as  normal  only  up  to  a  certain  point  eg  up  to  the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
expiration  of  the  tenth  hour  normal  working  day  the  days  work  the  regular  hours  of 
work Beyond this limit the workingtime is overtime and is taking the hour as unitmeasure 
paid better extra pay although often in a proportion ridiculously small The normal working 
day exists here as a fraction of the actual working day and the latter often during the whole year 
lasts  longer  than  the  former  The  increase  in  the  price  of  labour  with  the  extension  of  the 
working day beyond a certain normal limit takes such a shape in various British industries that 
the low price of labour during the socalled normal time compels the labourer to work during the 
better  paid  overtime  if  he  wishes  to  obtain  a  sufficient  wage  at  all  Legal  limitation  of  the 
working day puts an end to these amenities  
It is a fact generally known that the longer the working days in any branch of industry the lower 
are the wages A Redgrave factory inspector illustrates this by a comparative review of the  
years from  according to which wages rose in the factories under the  Hours Law 
whilst they fell in the factories in which the work lasted  to  hours daily  
From the law the price of labour being given the daily or weekly wage depends on the quantity 
of labour expended it follows first of all that the lower the price of labour the greater must be 
the quantity of labour or the longer must be the working day for the labourer to secure even a 
miserable  average  wage  The  lowness  of  the  price  of  labour  acts  here  as  a  stimulus  to  the 
extension of the labourtime  
On the other hand the extension of the workingtime produces in its turn a fall in the price of 
labour and with this a fall in the days or weeks wages  
The determination of the price of labour by 

daily value of labour power 

working day of a given number of hours 

shows that a mere prolongation of the working day lowers the price of labour if no compensation 
steps in But the same circumstances which allow the capitalist in the long run to prolong the 
working day also allow him first and compel him finally to nominally lower the price of labour 
until  the  total  price  of  the  increased  number  of  hours  is  lowered  and  therefore  the  daily  or 
weekly wage Reference to two circumstances is sufficient here If one man does the work of  
or    men  the  supply  of  labour  increases  although  the  supply  of  labourpower  on  the  market 
remains constant The competition thus created between the labourers allows the capitalist to beat 
down the price of labour whilst the falling price of labour allows him on the other hand to screw 
up  still  further  the  workingtime  Soon  however  this  command  over  abnormal  quantities  of 
unpaid  labour  ie  quantities  in  excess  of  the  average  social  amount  becomes  a  source  of 
competition amongst the capitalists themselves A part of the price of the commodity consists of 
the price of labour The unpaid part of the labourprice need not be reckoned in the price of the 
commodity It may be presented to the buyer This is the first step to which competition leads 
The second step to which it drives is to exclude also from the selling price of the commodity at 
least a part of the abnormal surplusvalue created by the extension of the working day In this 
way an abnormally low selling price of the commodity arises at first sporadically and becomes 
fixed  by  degrees  a  lower  selling  price  which  henceforward  becomes  the  constant  basis  of  a 
miserable  wage  for  an  excessive  workingtime  as  originally  it  was  the  product  of  these  very 
circumstances This movement is simply indicated here as the analysis of competition does not 
belong  to  this  part  of  our  subject  Nevertheless  the  capitalist  may  for  a  moment  speak  for 
himself In Birmingham there is so much competition of masters one against another that many 
are obliged to do things as employers that they would otherwise be ashamed of and yet no more 
money is made but only the public gets the benefit The reader will remember the two sorts of

so to this day The competition among the master bakers is the cause of the difficulty in getting 
rid of nightwork An underseller who sells his bread below the costprice according to the price 
of flour must make it up by getting more out of the labour of the men If I got only  hours 
work out of my men and my neighbor got  or  he must beat me in the selling price If the 
men could insist on payment for overwork this would be set right A large number of those 
employed by the undersellers are foreigners and youths who are obliged to accept almost any 
wages they can obtain  
This jeremiad is also interesting because it shows how the appearance only of the relations of 
production  mirrors  itself  in  the  brain  of  the  capitalist  The  capitalist  does  not  know  that  the 
normal price of labour also includes a definite quantity of unpaid labour and that this very unpaid 
labour is the normal source of his gain The category of surplus labourtime does not exist at all 
for him since it is included in the normal working day which he thinks he has paid for in the 
days wages But overtime does exist for him the prolongation of the working day beyond the 
limits corresponding with the usual price of labour Face to face with his underselling competitor 
he  even  insists  upon extra  pay  for  this  overtime  He  again  does  not  know  that  this  extra  pay 
includes  unpaid  labour  just  as  well  as  does  the  price  of  the  customary  hour  of  labour  For 
example the price of one hour of the  hours working day is d say the valueproduct of half a 
workinghour whilst the price of the overtime workinghour is d or the valueproduct of  
of a working hour In the first case the capitalist appropriates to himself onehalf in the second

An epochmaking work in the history of Political Economy 
 The wages of labour depend upon the price of labour and the quantity of labour performed An 
increase  in  the  wages of  labour  does  not  necessarily  imply  an  enhancement  of  the  price  of  labour 
From fuller employment and greater exertions the wages of labour may be considerably increased 
while the price of labour may continue the same West op cit pp    The main question 
How is the price of labour determined West however dismisses with mere banalities 
 This is perceived by the fanatical representative of the industrial bourgeoisie of the th century the 
author of the Essay on Trade and Commerce often quoted by us although he puts the matter in a 
confused way It is the quantity of labour and not the price of it he means by this the nominal daily 
or weekly wages that is determined by the price of provisions and other necessaries reduce the price 
of  necessaries  very  low  and  of  course  you  reduce  the  quantity  of  labour  in  proportion  Master 
manufacturers know that there are various ways of raising and felling the price of labour besides that 
of altering its nominal amount op cit pp   In his Three Lectures on the Rate of Wages 
London  in which N W Senior uses Wests work without mentioning it he says The labourer 
is  principally  interested  in  the  amount  of  wages  p    that  is  to  say  the  labourer  is  principally 
interested in what he receives the nominal sum of his wages not in that which he gives the amount of

 The effect of such an abnormal lessening of employment is quite different from that of a general 
reduction of the working day enforced by law The former has nothing to do with the absolute length 
of the working day and may occur just as well in a working day of  as of  hours The normal price 
of labour is in the first case calculated on the labourer working  hours in the second case on his 
working    hours  a  day  on  the  average  The  result  is  therefore  the  same  if  he  in  the  one  case  is

Chapter  Piece Wages 

Wages by the piece are nothing else than a converted form of wages by time just as wages by 
time are a converted form of the value or price of labourpower  
In piece wages it seems at first sight as if the usevalue bought from the labourer was not 
the function of his labourpower living labour but labour already realized in the product 
and as if the price of this labour was determined not as with timewages by the fraction  

daily value of labourpower 

the working day of a given number of hours 
but by the capacity for work of the producer 
The confidence that trusts in this appearance ought to receive a first severe shock from 
the fact that both forms of wages exist side by side simultaneously in the same branches 
of industry eg 

the compositors of London as a general rule work by the piece timework being 
the exception while those in the country work by the day the exception being 
work by the piece The shipwrights of the port of London work by the job or 
piece while those of all other parts work by the day  

In  the  same  saddlery  shops  of  London  often  for  the  same  work  piece  wages  are  paid  to  the 
French  timewages  to  the  English  In  the  regular  factories  in  which  throughout  piece  wages 
predominate particular kinds of work are unsuitable to this form of wage and are therefore paid 
by time But it is moreover selfevident that the difference of form in the payment of wages 
alters  in  no  way  their  essential  nature  although  the  one  form  may  be  more  favorable  to  the 
development of capitalist production than the other  
Let  the  ordinary  working  day  contain    hours  of  which    are  paid    unpaid  Let  its  value
product be  shillings that of one hours labour therefore d Let us suppose that as the result of 
experience a labourer who works with the average amount of intensity and skill who therefore 
gives in fact only the time socially necessary to the production of an article supplies in  hours 
 pieces either distinct products or measurable parts of a continuous whole Then the value of 
these    pieces  after  subtraction  of  the  portion  of  constant  capital  contained  in  them  is   
shillings and the value of a single piece d The labourer receives  d per piece and thus earns 
in  hours  shillings Just as with timewages it does not matter whether we assume that the 
labourer works  hours for himself and  hours for the capitalist or half of every hour for himself 
and the other half for the capitalist so here it does not matter whether we say that each individual 
piece is half paid and half unpaid for or that the price of  pieces is the equivalent only of the 
value of the labourpower whilst in the other  pieces surplusvalue is incorporated  
The form of piece wages is just as irrational as that of timewages Whilst in our example two 
pieces of a commodity after subtraction of the value of the means of production consumed in 
them are worth d as being the product of one hour the labourer receives for them a price of d 
Piece wages do not in fact distinctly express any relation of value It is not therefore a question 
of measuring the value of the piece by the workingtime incorporated in it but on the contrary of 
measuring the workingtime the labourer has expended by the number of pieces he has produced 
In timewages the labour is measured by its immediate duration in piece wages by the quantity 
of products in which the labour has embodied itself during a given time The price of labour time 

 

 

Chapter  
 
itself is finally determined by the equation value of a days labour  daily value of labourpower 
Piecewage is therefore only a modified form of timewage  
Let us now consider a little more closely the characteristic peculiarities of piece wages  
The  quality  of  the  labour  is  here  controlled  by  the  work  itself  which  must  be  of  average 
perfection if the pieceprice is to be paid in full piece wages become from this point of view the 
most fruitful source of reductions of wages and capitalistic cheating  
They furnish to the capitalist an exact measure for the intensity of labour Only the workingtime 
which  is  embodied  in  a  quantum  of  commodities  determined  beforehand  and  experimentally 
fixed counts as socially necessary workingtime and is paid as such In the larger workshops of 
the London tailors therefore a certain piece of work a waistcoat eg is called an hour or half 
an hour the hour at d By practice it is known how much is the average product of one hour 
With new fashions repairs c a contest arises between master and labourer as to whether a 
particular piece of work is one hour and so on until here also experience decides Similarly in 
the London furniture workshops c If the labourer does not possess the average capacity if he 
cannot in consequence supply a certain minimum of work per day he is dismissed 
Since  the  quality  and  intensity  of  the  work  are  here  controlled  by  the  form  of  wage  itself 
superintendence  of  labour  becomes  in  great  part  superfluous  Piece  wages  therefore  lay  the 
foundation  of  the  modern  domestic  labour  described  above  as  well  as  of  a  hierarchically 
organized system of exploitation and oppression The latter has two fundamental forms On the 
one hand piece wages facilitate the interposition of parasites between the capitalist and the wage
labourer  the  subletting  of  labour  The  gain  of  these  middlemen  comes  entirely  from  the 
difference  between the labourprice  which  the capitalist  pays and the  part  of  that price  which 
they actually allow to reach the labourer In England this system is characteristically called the 
sweating system On the other hand piecewage allows the capitalist to make a contract for so 
much per piece with the head labourer  in manufactures with the chief of some group in mines 
with the extractor of the coal in the factory with the actual machineworker  at a price for which 
the head labourer himself undertakes the enlisting and payment of his assistant work people The 
exploitation of the labourer by capital is here effected through the exploitation of the labourer by 
the labourer 
Given piecewage it is naturally the personal interest of the labourer to strain his labourpower as 
intensely as possible this enables the capitalist to raise more easily the normal degree of intensity 
of labour It is moreover now the personal interest of the labourer to lengthen the working day 
since with it his daily or weekly wages rise This gradually brings on a reaction like that already 
described in timewages without reckoning that the prolongation of the working day even if the 
piece wage remains constant includes of necessity a fall in the price of the labour  
In timewages with few exceptions the same wage holds for the same kind of work whilst in 
piece wages though the price of the working time is measured by a certain quantity of product 
the days or weeks wage will vary with the individual differences of the labourers of whom one 
supplies in a given time the minimum of product only another the average a third more than the 
average With regard to actual receipts there is therefore great variety according to the different 
skill strength energy stayingpower c of the individual labourers Of course this does not 
alter  the  general  relations  between  capital  and  wagelabour  First  the  individual  differences 
balance one another in the workshop as a whole which thus supplies in a given workingtime the 
average product and the total wages paid will be the average wages of that particular branch of 
industry Second the proportion between wages and surplusvalue remains unaltered since the 
mass of surplus labour supplied by each particular labourer corresponds with the wage received 
by him But the wider scope that piecewage gives to individuality tends to develop on the one 
 

 

Chapter  
 
hand  that  individuality  and  with  it  the  sense  of  liberty  independence  and  selfcontrol  of  the 
labourers  and  on  the  other  their  competition  one  with  another  Piecework  has  therefore  a 
tendency  while  raising  individual  wages  above  the  average  to  lower  this  average  itself  But 
where a particular rate of piecewage has for a long time been fixed by tradition and its lowering 
therefore presented especial difficulties the masters in such exceptional cases sometimes had 
recourse  to  its  compulsory  transformation  into  timewages  Hence  eg  in    a  great  strike 
among the ribbonweavers of Coventry Piecewage is finally one of the chief supports of the 
hoursystem described in the preceding chapter  
From  what  has  been  shown  so  far  it  follows  that  piecewage  is  the  form  of  wages  most  in 
harmony with the capitalist mode of production Although by no means new  it figures side by 
side with timewages officially in the French and English labour statutes of the th century  it 
only conquers a larger field for action during the period of manufacture properly socalled In the 
stormy  youth  of  modern  industry  especially  from    to    it  served  as  a  lever  for  the 
lengthening  of  the  working  day  and  the  lowering  of  wages  Very  important  materials  for  the 
fluctuation of wages during that period are to be found in the Blue books Report and Evidence 
from  the  Select  Committee  on  Petitions  respecting  the  Corn  Laws  Parliamentary  Session  of 
 and Report from the Lords Committee on the State of the Growth Commerce and 
Consumption  of  Grain  and  all  Laws  relating  thereto  Session  of    Here  we  find 
documentary evidence of the constant lowering of the price of labour from the beginning of the 
antiJacobin War In the weaving industry eg piece wages had fallen so low that in spite of the 
very great lengthening of the working day the daily wages were then lower than before 

The real earnings of the cotton weaver are now far less than they were his 
superiority over the common labourer which at first was very great has now 
almost entirely ceased Indeed the difference in the wages of skillful and 
common labour is far less now than at any former period  

How  little  the  increased  intensity  and  extension  of  labour  through  piece  wages  benefited  the 
agricultural proletariat the following passage borrowed from a work on the side of the landlords 
and farmers shows 

By far the greater part of agricultural operations is done by people who are hired 
for the day or on piecework Their weekly wages are about s and although it 
may be assumed that a man earns on piecework under the greater stimulus to 
labour s or perhaps s more than on weekly wages yet it is found on 
calculating his total income that his loss of employment during the year 
outweighs this gainFurther it will generally be found that the wages of these 
men bear a certain proportion to the price of the necessary means of subsistence 
so that a man with two children is able to bring up his family without recourse to 
parish relief  

Malthus at that time remarked with reference to the facts published by Parliament 

I confess that I see with misgiving the great extension of the practice of piece
wage Really hard work during  or  hours of the day or for any longer time 
is too much for any human being  

In the workshops under the Factory Acts piece wages become the general rule because capital 
can there only increase the efficacy of the working day by intensifying labour 
With the changing productiveness of labour the same quantum of product represents a varying 
workingtime Therefore piecewage also varies for it is the money expression of a determined 
workingtime In our example above  pieces were produced in  hours whilst the value of the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
product of the  hours was s the daily value of the labourpower s the price of the labour
hour d and the wage for one piece d In one piece halfanhours labour was absorbed If the 
same  working  day  now  supplies  in  consequence  of  the  doubled  productiveness  of  labour   
pieces  instead  of    and  all  other  circumstances  remain  unchanged  then  the  piecewage  falls 
from  d to d as every piece now only represents  instead of  of a workinghour  
by d  s and in like manner  by d  s In other words piecewage is lowered in the 
same proportion as the number of the pieces produced in the same time rises and therefore as 
the working time spent on the same piece falls This change in piecewage so far purely nominal 
leads to constant battles between capitalist and labour Either because the capitalist uses it as a 
pretext for actually lowering the price of labour or because increased productive power of labour 
is accompanied by an increased intensity of the same Or because the labourer takes seriously the 
appearance  of  piece  wages  viz  that  his  product  is  paid  for  and  not  his  labourpower  and 
therefore revolts against a lowering of wages unaccompanied by a lowering in the selling price of 
the commodity 

The operativescarefully watch the price of the raw material and the price of 
manufactured goods and are thus enabled to form an accurate estimate of their 
masters profits  

The  capitalist  rightly  knocks  on  the  head  such  pretensions  as  gross  errors  as  to  the  nature  of 
wagelabour He cries out against this usurping attempt to lay taxes on the advance of industry 
and declares roundly that the productiveness of labour does not concern the labourer at all  
                                                      
  The  system  of  piecework  illustrates  an  epoch  in  the  history  of  the  workingman  it  is  halfway 
between the position of the mere daylabourer depending upon the will of the capitalist and the co
operative artisan who in the not distant future promises to combine the artisan and the capitalist in his 
own person Pieceworkers are in fact their own masters even whilst working upon the capital of the

 This spontaneous result is often artificially helped along eg in the Engineering Trade of London a

Weavers Trades Union Brights partners had introduced new machinery which would turn out  
yards  of  carpet  in  the  time  and  with  the  labour    previously  required  to  produce    yards  The 
workmen had no claim whatever to share in the profits made by the investment of their employers

from d per yard to d leaving the earnings of the men exactly the same as before for the same 
labour But there was a nominal reduction of which the operatives it is asserted had not fair warning 
beforehand

Chapter  National Differences of Wages 

In the th chapter we were occupied with the manifold combinations which may bring about a 
change  in  magnitude  of  the  value  of  labourpower    this  magnitude  being  considered  either 
absolutely  or  relatively  ie  as  compared  with  surplusvalue  whilst  on  the  other  hand  the 
quantum of the means of subsistence in which the price of labour is realized might again undergo 
fluctuations independent  of  or  different  from  the  changes  of this  price  As  has  been  already 
said  the  simple  translation  of  the  value  or  respectively  of  the  price  of  labourpower  into the 
exoteric  form  of  wages  transforms  all  these  laws  into  laws  of  the  fluctuations  of  wages  That 
which  appears  in  these  fluctuations  of  wages  within  a  single  country  as  a  series  of  varying 
combinations  may  appear  in  different  countries  as  contemporaneous  difference  of  national 
wages In the comparison of the wages in different nations we must therefore take into account 
all the factors that determine changes in the amount of the value of labourpower the price and 
the  extent  of  the  prime  necessaries  of  life  as  naturally  and  historically  developed  the  cost  of 
training the labourers the part played by the labour of women and children the productiveness of 
labour its extensive and intensive magnitude Even the most superficial comparison requires the 
reduction first of the average daywage for the same trades in different countries to a uniform 
working day After this reduction to the same terms of the daywages timewage must again be 
translated into piecewage as the latter only can be a measure both of the productivity and the 
intensity of labour  
In  every  country  there  is a  certain  average  intensity  of  labour  below  which  the  labour  for  the 
production of a commodity requires more than the socially necessary time and therefore does not 
reckon as labour of normal quality Only a degree of intensity above the national average affects 
in a given country the measure of value by the mere duration of the workingtime This is not the 
case  on  the  universal  market  whose  integral  parts  are  the  individual  countries  The  average 
intensity of labour changes from country to country here it is greater there less These national 
averages form a scale whose unit of measure is the average unit of universal labour The more 
intense national labour therefore as compared with the less intense produces in the same time 
more value which expresses itself in more money  
But the law of value in its international application is yet more modified by the fact that on the 
worldmarket the more productive national labour reckons also as the more intense so long as the 
more  productive  nation  is  not  compelled  by  competition  to  lower  the  selling  price  of  its 
commodities to the level of their value  
In proportion as capitalist production is developed in a country in the same proportion do the 
national  intensity  and  productivity  of  labour  there  rise  above  the  international  level  The 
different quantities of commodities of the same kind produced in different countries in the same 
workingtime  have  therefore  unequal  international  values  which  are  expressed  in  different 
prices  ie  in  sums  of  money  varying  according  to  international  values  The  relative  value  of 
money will therefore be less in the nation with more developed capitalist mode of production 
than in the nation with less developed It follows then that the nominal wages the equivalent of 
labourpower expressed in money will also be higher in the first nation than in the second which 
does  not at  all  prove  that this  holds  also for  the  real  wages  ie for the  means  of subsistence 
placed at the disposal of the labourer  
But even apart from these relative differences of the value of money in different countries it will 
be found frequently that the daily or weekly tc wage in the first nation is higher than in the

second whilst the relative price of labour ie the price of labour as compared both with surplus
value and with the value of the product stands higher in the second than in the first  
J  W  Cowell  member  of  the  Factory  Commission  of    after  careful  investigation  of  the 
spinning trade came to the conclusion that 

 

in England wages are virtually lower to the capitalist though higher to the 
operative than on the Continent of Europe  

The English Factory Inspector Alexander Redgrave in his report of Oct st  proves by 
comparative  statistics  with  continental  states  that  in  spite  of  lower  wages  and  much  longer 
workingtime continental labour is in proportion to the product dearer than English An English 
manager of a cotton factory in Oldenburg declares that the working time there lasted from  
am  to    pm  Saturdays  included  and  that  the  workpeople  there  when  under  English 
overlookers did not supply during this time quite so much product as the English in  hours but 
under  German  overlookers  much  less  Wages  are  much  lower than  in  England  in  many  cases 
  but  the  number  of  hands  in  proportion  to  the  machinery  was  much  greater  in  certain 
departments in the proportion of   
Mr Redgrave gives very full details as to the Russian cotton factories The data were given him 
by  an  English  manager  until  recently  employed  there  On  this  Russian  soil  so  fruitful  of  all 
infamies the old horrors of the early days of English factories are in full swing The managers 
are of course English as the native Russian capitalist is of no use in factory business Despite all 
overwork  continued  day  and  night  despite  the  most  shameful  underpayment  of  the 
workpeople  Russian  manufacture  manages  to  vegetate  only  by  prohibition  of  foreign 
competition  
I give in conclusion a comparative table of Mr Redgraves on the average number of spindles 
per factory and per spinner in the different countries of Europe He himself remarks that he had 
collected these figures a few years ago and that since that time the size of the factories and the 
number  of  spindles  per  labourer  in  England  has  increased  He  supposes  however  an 
approximately equal progress in the continental countries mentioned so that the numbers given 
would still have their value for purposes of comparison  
AVERAGE NUMBER OF SPINDLES PER FACTORY  
England average of spindles per factory  
 
France average of spindles per factory

This comparison says Mr Redgrave is yet more unfavorable to Great Britain inasmuch as 
there is so large a number of factories in which weaving by power is carried on in conjunction 
with spinning whilst in the table the weavers are not deducted and the factories abroad are 
chiefly spinning factories if it were possible to compare like with like strictly I could find many 
cotton spinning factories in my district in which mules containing  spindles are minded by 
one man the minder and two assistants only turning off daily  lbs of yarn measuring  
miles in length  
It is well known that in Eastern Europe as well as in Asia English companies have undertaken 
the construction of railways and have in making them employed side by side with the native 
labourers a certain number of English workingmen Compelled by practical necessity they thus 
have  had  to  take  into  account  the  national  difference  in  the  intensity  of  labour  but  this  has 
brought them no loss Their experience shows that even if the height of wages corresponds more 
or less with the average intensity of labour the relative price of labour varies generally in the 
inverse direction  
In an Essay on the Rate of Wages one of his first economic writings H Carey tries to prove 
that the wages of the different nations are directly proportional to the degree of productiveness of 
the national working days in order to draw from this international relation the conclusion that 
wages everywhere rise and fall in proportion to the productiveness of labour The whole of our 
analysis of the production of surplusvalue shows the absurdity of this conclusion even if Carey 
himself  had  proved  his  premises  instead  of  after  his  usual  uncritical  and  superficial  fashion 
shuffling to and fro a confused mass of statistical materials The best of it is that he does not 
assert that things actually are as they ought to be according to his theory For State intervention 
has  falsified  the  natural  economic  relations  The  different  national  wages  must  be  reckoned 
therefore as if that part of each that goes to the State in the form of taxes came to the labourer 
himself  Ought  not  Mr  Carey  to  consider  further  whether  those  State  expenses  are  not  the 
natural fruits of capitalistic development The reasoning is quite worthy of the man who first 
declared the relations of capitalist production to be eternal laws of nature and reason whose free 
harmonious  working  is  only  disturbed  by  the  intervention  of  the  State  in  order  afterwards  to 
discover  that  the  diabolical  influence  of  England  on  the  world  market  an  influence  which  it 
appears  does  not  spring  from  the  natural  laws  of  capitalist  production  necessitates  State 
intervention ie the protection of those laws of nature and reason by the State alias the System 
of Protection He discovered further that the theorems of Ricardo and others in which existing 
social  antagonisms  and  contradictions  are  formulated  are  not  the  ideal  product  of  the  real 
economic  movement  but on  the  contrary  that  the real antagonisms  of capitalist  production in 
England and elsewhere are the result of the theories of Ricardo and others Finally he discovered 
that  it  is  in  the  last  resort  commerce  that  destroys  the  inborn  beauties  and  harmonies  of  the 
capitalist mode of production A step further and he will perhaps discover that the one evil in 
capitalist production is capital itself Only a man with such atrocious want of the critical faculty 
and such spurious erudition deserved in spite of his Protectionist heresy to become the secret 
source of the harmonious wisdom of a Bastiat and of all the other Freetrade optimists of today

Part  The Accumulation of Capital 

The conversion of a sum of money into means of production and labourpower is the first step 
taken by the quantum of value that is going to function as capital This conversion takes place in 
the  market  within  the  sphere  of  circulation  The  second  step  the  process  of  production  is 
complete so soon as the means of production have been converted into commodities whose value 
exceeds that of their component parts and therefore contains the capital originally advanced 
plus a surplusvalue These commodities must then be thrown into circulation They must be sold 
their  value  realised  in  money  this  money  afresh  converted  into  capital  and  so  over  and  over 
again  This  circular  movement  in  which  the  same  phases  are  continually  gone  through  in 
succession forms the circulation of capital  
The  first  condition  of  accumulation  is  that  the  capitalist  must  have  contrived  to  sell  his 
commodities  and  to  reconvert  into  capital  the  greater  part  of  the  money  so  received  In  the 
following pages we shall assume that capital circulates in its normal way The detailed analysis of 
the process will be found in Book II  
The  capitalist  who  produces  surplusvalue    ie  who  extracts unpaid  labour  directly  from  the 
labourers  and  fixes  it  in  commodities  is  indeed  the  first  appropriator  but  by  no  means  the 
ultimate owner of this surplusvalue He has to share it with capitalists with landowners c 
who fulfil other functions in the complex of social production Surplusvalue therefore splits up 
into  various  parts  Its  fragments  fall  to  various  categories  of  persons  and  take  various  forms 
independent the one of the other such as profit interest merchants profit rent c It is only in 
Book III that we can take in hand these modified forms of surplusvalue  
On the one hand then we assume that the capitalist sells at their value the commodities he has 
produced without concerning ourselves either about the new forms that capital assumes while in 
the  sphere  of  circulation  or  about  the  concrete  conditions  of  reproduction  hidden  under  these 
forms On the other hand we treat the capitalist producer as owner of the entire surplusvalue or 
better perhaps as the representative of all the sharers with him in the booty We therefore first of 
all  consider  accumulation from  an  abstract  point  of  view    ie  as  a  mere  phase  in  the  actual 
process of production  
So far as accumulation takes place the capitalist must have succeeded in selling his commodities 
and in reconverting the salemoney into capital Moreover the breakingup of surplusvalue into 
fragments  neither  alters  its  nature  nor  the  conditions  under  which  it  becomes  an  element  of 
accumulation Whatever be the proportion of surplusvalue which the industrial capitalist retains 
for himself or yields up to others he is the one who in the first instance appropriates it We 
therefore  assume  no  more  than  what  actually  takes  place  On  the  other  hand  the  simple 
fundamental form of the process of accumulation is obscured by the incident of the circulation 
which brings it about and by the splitting up of surplusvalue An exact analysis of the process 
therefore demands that we should for a time disregard all phenomena that hide the play of its 
inner mechanism 

 

 

 

Chapter  

Chapter  Simple Reproduction 

Whatever the form of the process of production in a society it must be a continuous process 
must  continue  to  go  periodically  through  the  same  phases  A  society  can  no  more  cease  to 
produce  than  it  can  cease  to  consume  When  viewed  therefore  as  a  connected  whole  and  as 
flowing  on  with  incessant  renewal  every  social  process  of  production  is  at  the  same  time  a 
process of reproduction  
The conditions of production are also those of reproduction No society can go on producing in 
other words no society can reproduce unless it constantly reconverts a part of its products into 
means of production or elements of fresh products All other circumstances remaining the same 
the only mode by which it can reproduce its wealth and maintain it at one level is by replacing 
the  means  of  production    ie  the  instruments  of  labour  the  raw  material  and  the  auxiliary 
substances consumed in the course of the year  by an equal quantity of the same kind of articles 
these must be separated from the mass of the yearly products and thrown afresh into the process 
of  production  Hence  a  definite  portion  of  each  years  product  belongs  to  the  domain  of 
production Destined for productive consumption from the very first this portion exists for the 
most part in the shape of articles totally unfitted for individual consumption  
If production be capitalistic in form so too will be reproduction Just as in the former the labour 
process figures but as a means towards the selfexpansion of capital so in the latter it figures but 
as a means of reproducing as capital  ie as selfexpanding value  the value advanced It is 
only  because  his  money  constantly  functions  as  capital that  the  economic  guise  of  a  capitalist 
attaches to a man If for instance a sum of  has this year been converted into capital and 
produced  a  surplusvalue  of    it  must  continue  during  next  year  and  subsequent  years  to 
repeat the same operation As a periodic increment of the capital advanced or periodic fruit of 
capital in process surplusvalue acquires the form of a revenue flowing out of capital  
If this revenue serve the capitalist only as a fund to provide for his consumption and be spent as 
periodically  as  it  is  gained  then  caeteris  paribus  simple  reproduction  will  take  place  And 
although this reproduction is a mere repetition of the process of production on the old scale yet 
this  mere  repetition  or  continuity  gives  a  new  character  to  the  process  or  rather  causes  the 
disappearance of some apparent characteristics which it possessed as an isolated discontinuous 
process  
The purchase of labourpower for a fixed period is the prelude to the process of production and 
this  prelude is  constantly  repeated  when the  stipulated  term  comes  to  an  end when  a  definite 
period of production such as a week or a month has elapsed But the labourer is not paid until 
after  he  has  expended  his  labourpower  and  realised  in  commodities  not  only  its  value  but 
surplusvalue  He  has  therefore  produced  not  only  surplusvalue  which  we  for  the  present 
regard  as  a  fund  to  meet  the  private  consumption  of  the  capitalist  but  he  has  also  produced 
before it flows back to him in the shape of wages the fund out of which he himself is paid the 
variable capital and his employment lasts only so long as he continues to reproduce this fund 
Hence that formula of the economists referred to in Chapter XVIII which represents wages as a 
share in the product itself What flows back to the labourer in the shape of wages is a portion of 
the product that is continuously reproduced by him The capitalist it is true pays him in money 
but this money is merely the transmuted form of the product of his labour While he is converting 
a portion of the means of production into products a portion of his former product is being turned 
into money It is his labour of last week or of last year that pays for his labourpower this week 

 

 

Chapter  
 
or this year The illusion begotten by the intervention of money vanishes immediately if instead 
of taking a single capitalist and a single labourer we take the class of capitalists and the class of 
labourers as a whole The capitalist class is constantly giving to the labouring class ordernotes in 
the form of money on a portion of the commodities produced by the latter and appropriated by 
the former The labourers give these ordernotes back just as constantly to the capitalist class and 
in this way get their share of their own product The transaction is veiled by the commodity form 
of the product and the money form of the commodity  
Variable  capital  is  therefore  only  a  particular  historical  form  of  appearance  of  the  fund  for 
providing  the  necessaries  of  life  or  the  labourfund  which  the  labourer  requires  for  the 
maintenance of himself and family and which whatever be the system of social production he 
must himself produce and reproduce If the labourfund constantly flows to him in the form of 
money that pays for his labour it is because the product he has created moves constantly away 
from him in the form of capital But all this does not alter the fact that it is the labourers own 
labour realised in a product which is advanced to him by the capitalist Let us take a peasant 
liable to do compulsory service for his lord He works on his own land with his own means of 
production for say  days a week The  other days he does forced work on the lords domain 
He  constantly  reproduces  his  own  labourfund  which  never  in  his  case  takes  the  form  of  a 
money  payment  for  his  labour  advanced  by  another  person  But  in  return  his  unpaid  forced 
labour for the lord on its side never acquires the character of voluntary paid labour If one fine 
morning the lord appropriates to himself the land the cattle the seed in a word the means of 
production of this peasant the latter will thenceforth be obliged to sell his labourpower to the 
lord He will ceteris paribus labour  days a week as before  for himself  for his lord who 
thenceforth becomes a wagespaying capitalist As before he will use up the means of production 
as means of production and transfer their value to the product As before a definite portion of the 
product will be devoted to reproduction But from the moment that the forced labour is changed 
into  wage  labour  from  that  moment  the  labourfund  which  the  peasant  himself  continues  as 
before to produce and reproduce takes the form of a capital advanced in the form of wages by the 
lord The bourgeois economist whose narrow mind is unable to separate the form of appearance 
from the thing that appears shuts his eyes to the fact that it is but here and there on the face of 
the earth that even nowadays the labour fund crops up in the form of capital  
Variable capital it is true only then loses its character of a value advanced out of the capitalists 
funds  when we view the process of capitalist production in the flow of its constant renewal But 
that process must have had a beginning of some kind From our present standpoint it therefore 
seems  likely  that  the  capitalist  once  upon  a  time  became  possessed  of  money  by  some 
accumulation  that  took  place  independently  of  the  unpaid  labour  of  others  and  that  this  was 
therefore how he was enabled to frequent the market as a buyer of labourpower However this 
may  be  the  mere  continuity  of  the  process  the  simple  reproduction  brings  about  some  other 
wonderful changes which affect not only the variable but the total capital  
If a capital of  beget yearly a surplusvalue of  and if this surplusvalue be consumed 
every year it is clear that at the end of  years the surplusvalue consumed will amount to   
 or the  originally advanced If only a part say one half were consumed the same 
result would follow at the end of  years since     General Rule The value of 
the capital advanced divided by the surplusvalue annually consumed gives the number of years 
or  reproduction  periods  at  the  expiration  of  which  the  capital  originally  advanced  has  been 
consumed by the capitalist and has disappeared The capitalist thinks that he is consuming the 
produce of the unpaid labour of others ie the surplusvalue and is keeping intact his original 
capital but what he thinks cannot alter facts After the lapse of a certain number of years the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
capital value he then possesses is equal to the sum total of the surplusvalue appropriated by him 
during those years and the total value he has consumed is equal to that of his original capital It is 
true  he  has  in  hand  a  capital  whose  amount  has  not  changed  and  of  which  a  part  viz  the 
buildings machinery c were already there when the work of his business began But what we 
have to do with here is not the material elements but the value of that capital When a person 
gets through all his property by taking upon himself debts equal to the value of that property it is 
clear that  his  property  represents  nothing  but  the  sum  total  of  his  debts  And so  it  is  with the 
capitalist when he has consumed the equivalent of his original capital the value of his present 
capital represents nothing but the total amount of the surplusvalue appropriated by him without 
payment Not a single atom of the value of his old capital continues to exist  
Apart  then  from  all  accumulation  the  mere  continuity  of  the  process  of  production  in  other 
words  simple  reproduction  sooner  or  later  and  of  necessity  converts  every  capital  into 
accumulated capital or capitalised surplusvalue Even if that capital was originally acquired by 
the  personal  labour  of  its  employer  it  sooner  or  later  becomes  value  appropriated  without  an 
equivalent the unpaid labour of others materialised either in money or in some other object We 
saw in Chapt IVVI that in order to convert money into capital something more is required than 
the  production  and  circulation  of  commodities  We  saw  that  on  the  one  side  the  possessor  of 
value or money on the other the possessor of the valuecreating substance on the one side the 
possessor of the means of production and subsistence on the other the possessor of nothing but 
labourpower must confront one another as buyer and seller The separation of labour from its 
product of subjective  labourpower  from  the  objective  conditions  of labour  was  therefore the 
real foundation in fact and the startingpoint of capitalist production  
But that which at first was but a startingpoint becomes by the mere continuity of the process by 
simple  reproduction  the  peculiar  result  constantly  renewed  and  perpetuated  of  capitalist 
production On the one hand the process of production incessantly converts material wealth into 
capital into means of creating more wealth and means of enjoyment for the capitalist On the 
other hand the labourer on quitting the process is what he was on entering it a source of wealth 
but devoid of all means of making that wealth his own Since before entering on the process his 
own labour has already been alienated from himself by the sale of his labourpower has been 
appropriated  by  the  capitalist  and  incorporated  with  capital  it  must  during  the  process  be 
realised  in  a  product  that  does  not  belong  to  him  Since  the  process  of  production  is  also  the 
process by which the capitalist consumes labourpower the product of the labourer is incessantly 
converted not only into commodities but into capital into value that sucks up the valuecreating 
power into means of subsistence that buy the person of the labourer into means of production 
that  command  the  producers  The  labourer  therefore  constantly  produces  material  objective 
wealth but in the form of capital of an alien power that dominates and exploits him and the 
capitalist as constantly produces labourpower but in the form of a subjective source of wealth 
separated  from  the  objects  in  and  by  which  it  can  alone  be  realised  in  short  he  produces  the 
labourer but as a wage labourer This incessant reproduction this perpetuation of the labourer is 
the sine qu non of capitalist production  
The labourer consumes in a twofold way While producing he consumes by his labour the means 
of  production  and  converts  them  into  products  with  a  higher  value  than  that  of  the  capital 
advanced This is his productive consumption It is at the same time consumption of his labour
power by the capitalist who bought it On the other hand the labourer turns the money paid to 
him  for  his  labourpower  into  means  of  subsistence  this  is  his  individual  consumption  The 
labourers productive consumption and his individual consumption are therefore totally distinct 
In the former he acts as the motive power of capital and belongs to the capitalist In the latter he 

 

 

Chapter  
 
belongs to himself and performs his necessary vital functions outside the process of production 
The result of the one is that the capitalist lives of the other that the labourer lives  
When  treating  of  the  working  day  we  saw  that  the  labourer  is  often  compelled  to  make  his 
individual consumption a mere incident of production In such a case he supplies himself with 
necessaries  in  order  to  maintain  his  labourpower  just  as  coal  and  water  are  supplied  to  the 
steamengine and oil to the wheel His means of consumption in that case are the mere means of 
consumption  required  by  a  means  of  production  his  individual  consumption  is  directly 
productive consumption This however appears to be an abuse not essentially appertaining to 
capitalist production 
The  matter  takes  quite  another  aspect  when  we  contemplate  not  the  single  capitalist  and the 
single  labourer  but  the  capitalist  class  and  the  labouring  class  not  an  isolated  process  of 
production but capitalist production in full swing and on its actual social scale By converting 
part of his capital into labourpower the capitalist augments the value of his entire capital He 
kills two birds with one stone He profits not only by what he receives from but by what he gives 
to the labourer The capital given in exchange for labourpower is converted into necessaries by 
the  consumption  of  which  the  muscles  nerves  bones  and  brains  of  existing  labourers  are 
reproduced and new labourers are begotten Within the limits of what is strictly necessary the 
individual  consumption  of  the  working  class  is  therefore  the  reconversion  of  the  means  of 
subsistence given by capital in exchange for labourpower into fresh labourpower at the disposal 
of capital for exploitation It is the production and reproduction of that means of production so 
indispensable to the capitalist the labourer himself The individual consumption of the labourer 
whether  it  proceed  within  the  workshop  or  outside  it  whether  it  be  part  of  the  process  of 
production or not forms therefore a factor of the production and reproduction of capital just as 
cleaning  machinery  does  whether  it  be  done  while  the  machinery  is  working  or  while  it  is 
standing The fact that the labourer consumes his means of subsistence for his own purposes and 
not to please the capitalist has no bearing on the matter The consumption of food by a beast of 
burden is none the less a necessary factor in the process of production because the beast enjoys 
what  it  eats  The  maintenance  and  reproduction  of  the  working  class  is  and  must  ever  be  a 
necessary  condition  to  the  reproduction  of  capital  But  the  capitalist  may  safely  leave  its 
fulfilment  to  the  labourers  instincts  of  selfpreservation  and  of  propagation  All  the  capitalist 
cares for is to reduce the labourers individual consumption as far as possible to what is strictly 
necessary  and  he  is  far  away  from  imitating  those  brutal  South  Americans  who  force  their 
labourers to take the more substantial rather than the less substantial kind of food 
Hence both the capitalist and his ideological representative the political economist consider that 
part alone of the labourers individual consumption to be productive which is requisite for the 
perpetuation  of  the  class and  which  therefore  must take  place in  order  that the  capitalist  may 
have  labourpower  to  consume  what  the labourer  consumes  for  his  own  pleasure  beyond  that 
part is unproductive consumption If the accumulation of capital were to cause a rise of wages 
and an increase in the labourers consumption unaccompanied by increase in the consumption of 
labourpower by capital the additional capital would be consumed unproductively In reality 
the individual consumption of the labourer is unproductive as regards himself for it reproduces 
nothing but the needy individual it is productive to the capitalist and to the State since it is the 
production of the power that creates their wealth 
From a social point of view therefore the working class even when not directly engaged in the 
labour  process  is just  as much  an  appendage  of  capital as the  ordinary  instruments  of labour 
Even  its  individual  consumption  is  within  certain  limits  a  mere  factor  in  the  process  of 
production That process however takes good care to prevent these selfconscious instruments

from leaving it in the lurch for it removes their product as fast as it is made from their pole to 
the opposite pole of capital Individual consumption provides on the one hand the means for 
their  maintenance  and  reproduction  on  the  other  hand  it  secures  by  the  annihilation  of  the 
necessaries of life the continued reappearance of the workman in the labourmarket The Roman 
slave  was  held  by  fetters  the  wage  labourer  is  bound  to  his  owner  by  invisible  threads  The 
appearance of independence is kept up by means of a constant change of employers and by the

In  former  times  capital  resorted  to  legislation  whenever  necessary  to  enforce  its  proprietary 
rights over the free labourer For instance down to  the emigration of mechanics employed 
in machine making was in England forbidden under grievous pains and penalties  
The  reproduction  of the  working  class carries  with it  the  accumulation  of  skill  that  is  handed 
down  from  one  generation  to  another  To  what  extent  the  capitalist  reckons  the  existence  of 
such  a  skilled  class  among  the  factors  of  production  that  belong  to  him  by  right  and  to  what 
extent  he  actually  regards  it  as  the  reality  of  his  variable  capital  is  seen  so  soon  as  a  crisis 
threatens  him  with  its  loss  In  consequence  of  the  civil  war  in  the  United  States  and  of  the 
accompanying cotton famine the majority of the cotton operatives in Lancashire were as is well 
known thrown out of work Both from the working class itself and from other ranks of society 
there  arose  a  cry  for  State  aid  or  for  voluntary  national  subscriptions  in  order  to  enable  the 
superfluous hands to emigrate to the colonies or to the United States Thereupon The Times 
published  on  the  th  March    a  letter  from  Edmund  Potter  a  former  president  of  the 
Manchester Chamber of Commerce This letter was rightly called in the House of Commons the 
manufacturers manifesto We cull here a few characteristic passages in which the proprietary 
rights of capital over labourpower are unblushingly asserted  

He the man out of work may be told the supply of cottonworkers is too large 
 and  must  in fact be reduced by a third perhaps and that then there will be 
a healthy demand for the remaining twothirds Public opinion urges 
emigration The master cannot willingly see his labour supply being removed 
he may think and perhaps justly that it is both wrong and unsound But if the 
public funds are to be devoted to assist emigration he bas a right to be heard and 
perhaps to protest  

Mr Potter then shows how useful the cotton trade is how the trade has undoubtedly drawn the 
surpluspopulation from Ireland and from the agricultural districts how immense is its extent 
how in the year  it yielded  ths of the total English exports how after a few years it will 
again expand by the extension of the market particularly of the Indian market and by calling 
forth a plentiful supply of cotton at d per lb He then continues 

Some time one two or three years it may be will produce the quantity The 
question I would put then is this  Is the trade worth retaining Is it worth while to 
keep the machinery he means the living labour machines in order and is it not 
the greatest folly to think of parting with that I think it is I allow that the workers 
are not a property not the property of Lancashire and the masters but they are the 
strength of both they are the mental and trained power which cannot be replaced 
for a generation the mere machinery which they work might much of it be 
beneficially replaced nay improved in a twelvemonth  Encourage or allow  
the workingpower to emigrate and what of the capitalist Take away the cream 
of the workers and fixed capital will depreciate in a great degree and the floating 
will not subject itself to a struggle with the short supply of inferior labour We 
are told the workers wish it emigration Very natural it is that they should do

so Reduce compress the cotton trade by taking away its working power and 
reducing their wages expenditure say onefifth or five millions and what then 
would happen to the class above the small shopkeepers and what of the rents the 
cottage rents Trace out the effects upwards to the small farmer the better 
householder and  the landowner and say if there could be any suggestion more 
suicidal to all classes of the country than by enfeebling a nation by exporting the 
best of its manufacturing population and destroying the value of some of its most 
productive capital and enrichment  I advise a loan of five or six millions 
sterling  extending it may be over two or three years administered by special 
commissioners added to the Boards of Guardians in the cotton districts under 
special legislative regulations enforcing some occupation or labour as a means of 
keeping up at least the moral standard of the recipients of the loan can anything 
be worse for landowners or masters than parting with the best of the workers and 
demoralising and disappointing the rest by an extended depletive emigration a 
depletion of capital and value in an entire province  

Potter the chosen mouthpiece of the manufacturers distinguishes two sorts of machinery each 
of which belongs to the capitalist and of which one stands in his factory the other at nighttime 
and on Sundays is housed outside the factory in cottages The one is inanimate the other living 
The inanimate machinery not only wears out and depreciates from day to day but a great part of 
it becomes so quickly superannuated by constant technical progress that it can be replaced with 
advantage  by  new  machinery  after  a  few  months  The  living  machinery  on  the  contrary  gets 
better the longer it lasts and in proportion as the skill handed from one generation to another 
accumulates The Times answered the cotton lord as follows 

Mr Edmund Potter is so impressed with the exceptional and supreme importance 
of the cotton masters that in order to preserve this class and perpetuate their 
profession he would keep half a million of the labouring class confined in a great 
moral workhouse against their will Is the trade worth retaining asks Mr Potter 
Certainly by all honest means it is we answer Is it worth while keeping the 
machinery in order again asks Mr Potter Here we hesitate By the machinery 
Mr Potter means the human machinery for he goes on to protest that he does not 
mean to use them as an absolute property We must confess that we do not think it 
worth while or even possible to keep the human machinery in order  that is to 
shut it up and keep it oiled till it is wanted Human machinery will rust under 
inaction oil and rub it as you may Moreover the human machinery will as we 
have just seen get the steam up of its own accord and burst or run amuck in our 
great towns It might as Mr Potter says require some time to reproduce the 
workers but having machinists and capitalists at hand we could always find 
thrifty hard industrious men wherewith to improvise more master manufacturers 
than we can ever want Mr Potter talks of the trade reviving in one two or three 
years and he asks us not to encourage or allow  the working power to 
emigrate He says that it is very natural the workers should wish to emigrate 
but he thinks that in spite of their desire the nation ought to keep this half million 
of workers with their  dependents shut up in the cotton districts and as a 
necessary consequence he must of course think that the nation ought to keep 
down their discontent by force and sustain them by alms  and upon the chance 
that the cotton masters may some day want them The time is come when the 
great public opinion of these islands must operate to save this working power

from those who would deal with it as they would deal with iron and coal and 
cotton  

The Times article was only a jeu desprit The great public opinion was in fact of Mr Potters 
opinion that the factory operatives are part of the movable fittings of a factory Their emigration 
was  prevented They  were  locked  up in  that  moral workhouse  the  cotton districts and they 
form as before the strength of the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire  
Capitalist production therefore of itself reproduces the separation between labourpower and the 
means of labour It thereby reproduces and perpetuates the condition for exploiting the labourer 
It incessantly forces him to sell his labourpower in order to live and enables the capitalist to 
purchase labourpower in order that he may enrich himself It is no longer a mere accident that 
capitalist and labourer confront each other in the market as buyer and seller It is the process itself 
that incessantly hurls back the labourer on to the market as a vendor of his labourpower and that 
incessantly converts his own product into a means by which another man can purchase him In 
reality  the  labourer  belongs  to  capital  before  he  has  sold  himself  to  capital  His  economic 
bondage  is both brought about and concealed by the periodic sale of himself by his change of 
masters and by the oscillations in the marketprice of labourpower 
Capitalist production therefore under its aspect of a continuous connected process of a process 
of reproduction produces not only commodities not only surplusvalue but it also produces and 
reproduces the capitalist relation on the one side the capitalist on the other the wage labourer

labourers  in  consideration  of  certain  feudal  services  under  a  contract  called  bondage  which

Chapter  Conversion of SurplusValue into 

Capital 

Section   Capitalist Production on a Progressively Increasing 
Scale Transition of the Laws of Property that Characterise 

Production of Commodities into Laws of Capitalist 

Appropriation 

Hitherto we have investigated how surplusvalue emanates from capital we have now to see how 
capital arises from surplusvalue Employing surplusvalue as capital reconverting it into capital 
is called accumulation of capital  
First let us consider this transaction from the standpoint of the individual capitalist Suppose a 
spinner to have advanced a capital of  of which fourfifths  are laid out in cotton 
machinery c and onefifth  in wages Let him produce  lbs of yarn annually 
having  a  value  of    The  rate  of  surplusvalue  being    the  surplusvalue  lies  in  the 
surplus  or  net  product  of    lbs  of  yarn  onesixth  of  the  gross  product  with  a  value  of 
 which will be realised by a sale  is  We can neither see nor smell in this 
sum of money a trace of surplusvalue When we know that a given value is surplusvalue we 
know how its owner came by it but that does not alter the nature either of value or of money  
In  order  to  convert  this  additional  sum  of    into  capital  the  masterspinner  will  all 
circumstances remaining as before advance fourfifths of it  in the purchase of cotton 
c and onefifth  in the purchase of additional spinners who will find in the market the 
necessaries of life whose value the master has advanced to them  
Then the new capital of  functions in the spinning mill and brings in in its turn a surplus
value of   
The capital value was originally advanced in the money form The surplusvalue on the contrary 
is originally the value of a definite portion of the gross product If this gross product be sold 
converted into money the capital value regains its original form From this moment the capital 
value and the surplusvalue are both of them sums of money and their reconversion into capital 
takes place in precisely the same way The one as well as the other is laid out by the capitalist in 
the purchase of commodities that place him in a position to begin afresh the fabrication of his 
goods and this time on an extended scale But in order to be able to buy those commodities he 
must find them ready in the market  
His  own  yarns  circulate  only  because  he  brings  his  annual  product  to  market  as  all  other 
capitalists likewise do with their commodities But these commodities before coming to market 
were part of the general annual product part of the total mass of objects of every kind into which 
the  sum  of  the  individual  capitals  ie  the  total  capital  of  society  had  been  converted  in  the 
course of the year and of which each capitalist had in hand only an aliquot part The transactions 
in the market effectuate only the interchange of the individual components of this annual product 
transfer them from one hand to another but can neither augment the total annual production nor 
alter  the  nature  of  the  objects  produced  Hence  the  use  that  can  be  made  of  the  total  annual 
product depends entirely upon its own composition but in no way upon circulation  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The annual production must in the first place furnish all those objects use values from which the 
material components of capital used up in the course of the year have to be replaced Deducting 
these there remains the net or surplusproduct in which the surplusvalue lies And of what does 
this  surplusproduct  consist  Only  of  things  destined  to  satisfy  the  wants  and  desires  of  the 
capitalist class things which consequently enter into the consumption fund of the capitalists 
Were that the case the cup of surplusvalue would be drained to the very dregs and nothing but 
simple reproduction would ever take place  
To  accumulate  it  is  necessary  to  convert  a  portion  of  the  surplusproduct  into  capital  But  we 
cannot except by a miracle convert into capital anything but such articles as can be employed in 
the  labour  process  ie  means  of  production  and  such  further  articles  as  are  suitable  for  the 
sustenance of the labourer ie means of subsistence Consequently a part of the annual surplus 
labour  must  have  been  applied  to  the  production  of  additional  means  of  production  and 
subsistence over and above the quantity of these things required to replace the capital advanced 
In one word surplusvalue is convertible into capital solely because the surplusproduct whose 
value it is already comprises the material elements of new capital  
Now  in  order  to  allow  of  these  elements  actually  functioning  as  capital  the  capitalist  class 
requires additional labour If the exploitation of the labourers already employed do not increase 
either  extensively  or  intensively  then  additional  labourpower  must  be  found  For  this  the 
mechanism of capitalist production provides beforehand by converting the working class into a 
class dependent on wages a class whose ordinary wages suffice not only for its maintenance but 
for  its  increase  It  is  only  necessary  for  capital  to  incorporate  this  additional  labourpower 
annually  supplied  by  the  working  class  in  the  shape  of  labourers  of  all  ages  with  the  surplus 
means of production comprised in the annual produce and the conversion of surplusvalue into 
capital  is  complete  From  a  concrete  point  of  view  accumulation  resolves  itself  into  the 
reproduction  of  capital  on  a  progressively  increasing  scale  The  circle  in  which  simple 
reproduction moves alters its form and to use Sismondis expression changes into a spiral  
Let us now return to our illustration It is the old story Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob 
and  so  on  The  original  capital  of    brings  in  a  surplusvalue  of    which  is 
capitalised  The  new  capital  of    brings  in  a  surplusvalue  of    and  this  too  is 
capitalised  converted  into  a  second  additional  capital  which  in  its  turn  produces  a  further 
surplusvalue of  And so the ball rolls on  
We here leave out of consideration the portion of the surplusvalue consumed by the capitalist 
Just as little does it concern us for the moment whether the additional capital is joined on to the 
original  capital  or is separated from  it  to  function independently  whether the  same  capitalist 
who accumulated it employs it or whether he hands it over to another This only we must not 
forget that by the side of the newlyformed capital the original capital continues to reproduce 
itself and to produce surplusvalue and that this is also true of all accumulated capital and the 
additional capital engendered by it  
The  original  capital  was  formed  by  the  advance  of    How  did  the  owner  become 
possessed  of  it  By  his  own  labour  and  that  of  his  forefathers  answer  unanimously  the 
spokesmen of Political Economy And in fact their supposition appears the only one consonant 
with the laws of the production of commodities  
But it is quite otherwise with regard to the additional capital of  How that originated we 
know perfectly well There is not one single atom of its value that does not owe its existence to 
unpaid labour The means of production with which the additional labourpower is incorporated 
as well as the necessaries with which the labourers are sustained are nothing but component parts 
of the surplusproduct of the tribute annually exacted from the working class by the capitalist 
 

 

Chapter  
 
class Though the latter with a portion of that tribute purchases the additional labourpower even 
at its full price so that equivalent is exchanged for equivalent yet the transaction is for all that 
only  the  old  dodge  of  every  conqueror  who  buys  commodities  from  the  conquered  with  the 
money he has robbed them of  
If the additional capital employs the person who produced it this producer must not only continue 
to augment the value of the original capital but must buy back the fruits of his previous labour 
with more labour than they cost When viewed as a transaction between the capitalist class and 
the working class it makes no difference that additional labourers are employed by means of the 
unpaid  labour  of  the  previously  employed  labourers  The  capitalist  may  even  convert  the 
additional capital into a machine that throws the producers of that capital out of work and that 
replaces them by a few children In every case the working class creates by the surplus labour of 
one year the capital destined to employ additional labour in the following year And this is what 
is called creating capital out of capital  
The  accumulation  of  the  first  additional  capital  of    presupposes  a  value  of   
belonging to the capitalist by virtue of his primitive labour and advanced by him The second 
additional capital of  presupposes on the contrary only the previous accumulation of the 
 of which the  is the surplusvalue capitalised The ownership of past unpaid labour is 
thenceforth  the  sole  condition  for  the  appropriation  of  living  unpaid  labour  on  a  constantly 
increasing scale The more the capitalist has accumulated the more is he able to accumulate  
In so far as the surplusvalue of which the additional capital No  consists is the result of the 
purchase of labourpower with part of the original capital a purchase that conformed to the laws 
of the exchange of commodities and that from a legal standpoint presupposes nothing beyond 
the free disposal on the part of the labourer of his own capacities and on the part of the owner of 
money or commodities of the values that belong to him in so far as the additional capital No  
c is the mere result of No  and therefore a consequence of the above conditions in so far as 
each  single  transaction  invariably  conforms  to  the  laws  of  the  exchange  of  commodities  the 
capitalist buying labourpower the labourer selling it and we will assume at its real value in so 
far as all this is true it is evident that the laws of appropriation or of private property laws that 
are  based  on  the  production  and  circulation  of  commodities  become  by  their  own  inner  and 
inexorable dialectic changed into their very opposite The exchange of equivalents the original 
operation with which we started has now become turned round in such a way that there is only an 
apparent exchange This is owing to the fact first that the capital which is exchanged for labour
power is itself but a portion of the product of others labour appropriated without an equivalent 
and secondly that this capital must not only be replaced by its producer but replaced together 
with  an  added  surplus  The  relation  of  exchange  subsisting  between  capitalist  and  labourer 
becomes a mere semblance appertaining to the process of circulation a mere form foreign to the 
real  nature  of  the  transaction  and  only  mystifying  it  The  ever  repeated  purchase  and  sale  of 
labourpower is now the mere form what really takes place is this  the capitalist again and again 
appropriates without equivalent a portion of the previously materialised labour of others and 
exchanges it for a greater quantity of living labour At first the rights of property seemed to us to 
be  based  on  a  mans  own  labour  At  least  some  such  assumption  was  necessary  since  only 
commodityowners with equal rights confronted each other and the sole means by which a man 
could become possessed of the commodities of others was by alienating his own commodities 
and these could be replaced by labour alone Now however property turns out to be the right on 
the part of the capitalist to appropriate the unpaid labour of others or its product and to be the 
impossibility  on  the  part of  the  labourer  of  appropriating  his  own  product The  separation  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
property from labour has become the necessary consequence of a law that apparently originated 
in their identity  
Therefore however much the capitalist mode of appropriation may seem to fly in the face of the 
original laws of commodity production it nevertheless arises not from a violation but on the 
contrary  from  the  application  of  these  laws  Let  us  make  this  clear  once  more  by  briefly 
reviewing the consecutive phases of motion whose culminating point is capitalist accumulation  
We  saw  in  the  first  place  that  the  original  conversion  of  a  sum  of  values  into  capital  was 
achieved in complete accordance with the laws of exchange One party to the contract sells his 
labourpower the other buys it The former receives the value of his commodity whose use value 
 labour  is thereby alienated to the buyer Means of production which already belong to the 
latter are then transformed by him with the aid of labour equally belonging to him into a new 
product which is likewise lawfully his  
The value of this product includes first the value of the usedup means of production Useful 
labour  cannot  consume  these  means  of  production  without  transferring  their  value  to  the  new 
product  but  to  be  saleable  labourpower  must  be  capable  of  supplying  useful  labour  in  the 
branch of industry in which it is to be employed  
The value of the new product further includes the equivalent of the value of the labourpower 
together  with  a  surplusvalue  This  is  so  because  the  value  of  the  labourpower    sold  for  a 
definite length of time say a day a week etc  is less than the value created by its use during 
that time But the worker has received payment for the exchangevalue of his labourpower and 
by so doing has alienated its use value  this being the case in every sale and purchase  
The  fact  that  this  particular  commodity  labourpower  possesses  the  peculiar  use  value  of 
supplying  labour  and  therefore  of  creating  value  cannot affect the  general  law  of  commodity 
production If therefore the magnitude of value advanced in wages is not merely found again in 
the product but is found there augmented by a surplusvalue this is not because the seller has 
been defrauded for he has really received the value of his commodity it is due solely to the fact 
that this commodity has been used up by the buyer  
The  law  of  exchange  requires  equality  only  between  the  exchangevalues  of  the  commodities 
given in exchange for one another From the very outset it presupposes even a difference between 
their use values and it has nothing whatever to do with their consumption which only begins after 
the deal is closed and executed  
Thus the original conversion of money into capital is achieved in the most exact accordance with 
the economic laws of commodity production and with the right of property derived from them 
Nevertheless its result is  
 that the product belongs to the capitalist and not to the worker  
 that the value of this product includes besides the value of the capital advanced a surplus
value which costs the worker labour but the capitalist nothing and which none the less becomes 
the legitimate property of the capitalist  
 that the worker has retained his labourpower and can sell it anew if he can find a buyer  
Simple reproduction is only the periodical repetition of this first operation each time money is 
converted afresh into capital Thus the law is not broken on the contrary it is merely enabled to 
operate continuously Several successive acts of exchange have only made the last represent the 
first Sismondi Nouveaux Principes etc p   
And yet we have seen that simple reproduction suffices to stamp this first operation in so far as it 
is conceived as an isolated process with a totally changed character Of those who share the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
national income among themselves the one side the workers acquire every year a fresh right to 
their  share  by  fresh  work  the  others  the  capitalists  have  already  acquired  by  work  done 
originally a permanent right to their share Sismondi l c pp   It is indeed notorious 
that the sphere of labour is not the only one in which primogeniture works miracles  
Nor does it matter if simple reproduction is replaced by reproduction on an extended scale by 
accumulation In the former case the capitalist squanders the whole surplusvalue in dissipation 
in  the  latter  he  demonstrates  his  bourgeois  virtue  by  consuming  only  a  portion  of  it  and 
converting the rest into money  
The surplusvalue is his property it has never belonged to anyone else If he advances it for the 
purposes of production the advances made come from his own funds exactly as on the day when 
he first entered the market The fact that on this occasion the funds are derived from the unpaid 
labour of his workers makes absolutely no difference If worker B is paid out of the surplusvalue 
which worker A produced then in the first place A furnished that surplusvalue without having 
the just price of his commodity cut by a halfpenny and in the second place the transaction is no 
concern of Bs whatever What B claims and has a right to claim is that the capitalist should pay 
him the value of his labourpower Both were still gainers the worker because he was advanced 
the fruits of his labour should read of the unpaid labour of other workers before the work was 
done should read before his own labour had borne fruit the employer le matre because the 
labour of this worker was worth more than his wages should read produced more value than 
the value of his wages Sismondi l c p   
To  be  sure  the  matter  looks  quite  different  if  we  consider  capitalist  production  in  the 
uninterrupted flow of its renewal and if in place of the individual capitalist and the individual 
worker we view in their totality the capitalist class and the working class confronting each other 
But in so doing we should be applying standards entirely foreign to commodity production  
Only  buyer  and  seller  mutually  independent  face  each  other  in  commodity  production  The 
relations between them cease on the day when the term stipulated in the contract they concluded 
expires If the transaction is repeated it is repeated as the result of a new agreement which has 
nothing to do with the previous one and which only by chance brings the same seller together 
again with the same buyer  
If therefore commodity production or one of its associated processes is to be judged according 
to  its  own  economic  laws  we  must  consider  each  act  of  exchange  by  itself  apart  from  any 
connexion  with  the  act  of  exchange  preceding  it  and  that  following  it  And  since  sales  and 
purchases are negotiated solely between particular individuals it is not admissible to seek here 
for relations between whole social classes  
However  long  a  series  of  periodical  reproductions  and  preceding  accumulations  the  capital 
functioning today may have passed through it always preserves its original virginity So long as 
the laws of exchange are observed in every single act of exchange the mode of appropriation can 
be completely revolutionised without in any way affecting the property rights which correspond 
to commodity production These same rights remain in force both at the outset when the product 
belongs to its producer who exchanging equivalent for equivalent can enrich himself only by 
his  own  labour  and  also  in  the  period  of  capitalism  when  social  wealth  becomes  to  an  ever
increasing degree the property of those who are in a position to appropriate continually and ever 
afresh the unpaid labour of others  
This result becomes inevitable from the moment there is a free sale by the labourer himself of 
labourpower as a commodity But it is also only from then onwards that commodity production 
is generalised and becomes the typical form of production it is only from then onwards that from 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the first every product is produced for sale and all wealth produced goes through the sphere of 
circulation Only when and where wage labour is its basis does commodity production impose 
itself  upon  society  as  a  whole  but  only  then  and  there  also  does  it  unfold  all  its  hidden 
potentialities To say that the supervention of wage labour adulterates commodity production is to 
say that commodity production must not develop if it is to remain unadulterated To the extent 
that  commodity  production  in  accordance  with  its  own  inherent  laws  develops  further  into 
capitalist  production  the  property  laws  of  commodity  production  change  into  the  laws  of 
capitalist appropriation  
We  have  seen  that  even  in  the  case  of  simple  reproduction  all  capital  whatever  its  original 
source becomes converted into accumulated capital capitalised surplusvalue But in the flood of 
production  all  the  capital  originally  advanced  becomes  a  vanishing  quantity  magnitudo 
evanescens in the mathematical sense compared with the directly accumulated capital ie with 
the surplusvalue or surplusproduct that is reconverted into capital whether it functions in the 
hands  of  its  accumulator  or  in  those  of  others  Hence  Political  Economy  describes  capital  in 
general as  accumulated wealth  converted  surplusvalue  or  revenue  that  is  employed  over 
again in the production of surplusvalue and the capitalist as the owner of surplusvalue It 
is merely another way of expressing the same thing to say that all existing capital is accumulated 
or capitalised interest for interest is a mere fragment of surplusvalue  

Section  Erroneous Conception by Political Economy of 

Reproduction on a Progressively Increasing Scale 

Before we further investigate accumulation or the reconversion of surplusvalue into capital we 
must brush on one side an ambiguity introduced by the classical economists  
Just as little as the commodities that the capitalist buys with a part of the surplusvalue for his 
own consumption serve the purpose of production and of creation of value so little is the labour 
that he buys for the satisfaction of his natural and social requirements productive labour Instead 
of  converting  surplusvalue  into  capital  he  on  the  contrary  by  the  purchase  of  those 
commodities and that labour consumes or expends it as revenue In the face of the habitual mode 
of life of the old feudal nobility which as Hegel rightly says consists in consuming what is in 
hand and more especially displays itself in the luxury of personal retainers it was extremely 
important for bourgeois economy to promulgate the doctrine that accumulation of capital is the 
first duty of every citizen and to preach without ceasing that a man cannot accumulate if he eats 
up all his revenue instead of spending a good part of it in the acquisition of additional productive 
labourers who bring in more than they cost On the other hand the economists had to contend 
against the popular prejudice that confuses capitalist production with hoarding and fancies that 
accumulated wealth is either wealth that is rescued from being destroyed in its existing form ie 
from being consumed or wealth that is withdrawn from circulation Exclusion of money from 
circulation would also exclude absolutely its selfexpansion as capital while accumulation of a 
hoard  in  the  shape  of  commodities  would  be  sheer  tomfoolery  The  accumulation  of 
commodities  in  great  masses  is  the  result  either  of  overproduction  or  of  a  stoppage  of 
circulation It is true that the popular mind is impressed by the sight on the one hand of the 
mass of goods that are stored up for gradual consumption by the rich and on the other hand by 
the  formation  of  reserve  stocks  the  latter  a  phenomenon  that  is  common  to  all  modes  of 
production and on which we shall dwell for a moment when we come to analyse circulation 
Classical economy is therefore quite right when it maintains that the consumption of surplus
products  by  productive  instead  of  by  unproductive  labourers is  a characteristic  feature  of the 

 

Chapter  
 
process of accumulation But at this point the mistakes also begin Adam Smith has made it the 
fashion  to  represent  accumulation  as  nothing  more  than  consumption  of  surplus  products  by 
productive labourers which amounts to saying that the capitalising of surplusvalue consists in 
merely turning surplusvalue into labourpower 
Let us see what Ricardo eg says 

 

It must be understood that all the productions of a country are consumed but it 
makes the greatest difference imaginable whether they are consumed by those 
who reproduce or by those who do not reproduce another value When we say 
that revenue is saved and added to capital what we mean is that the portion of 
revenue so said to be added to capital is consumed by productive instead of 
unproductive labourers There can be no greater error than in supposing that 
capital is increased by nonconsumption  

There can be no greater error than that which Ricardo and all subsequent economists repeat after 
A Smith viz that 

the part of revenue of which it is said it has been added to capital is consumed 
by productive labourers  

According to this all surplusvalue that is changed into capital becomes variable capital So far 
from this being the case the surplusvalue like the original capital divides itself into constant 
capital  and  variable  capital  into  means  of  production  and  labourpower  Labourpower  is  the 
form  under  which  variable  capital  exists  during  the  process  of  production  In  this  process  the 
labourpower is itself consumed by the capitalist while the means of production are consumed by 
the labourpower in the exercise of its function labour At the same time the money paid for the 
purchase  of  the  labourpower  is  converted  into  necessaries  that  are  consumed  not  by 
productive  labour  but  by  the  productive  labourer  Adam  Smith  by  a  fundamentally 
perverted analysis arrives at the absurd conclusion that even though each individual capital is 
divided into a constant and a variable part the capital of society resolves itself only into variable 
capital  ie  is  laid  out  exclusively  in  payment  of  wages  For  instance  suppose  a  cloth 
manufacturer converts  into capital One portion he lays out in buying weavers the other in 
woollen yarn machinery c But the people from whom he buys the yarn and the machinery 
pay for labour with a part of the purchase money and so on until the whole  are spent in 
the payment of wages ie until the entire product represented by the  has been consumed 
by productive labourers It is evident that the whole gist of this argument lies in the words and so 
on which send us from pillar to post In truth Adam Smith breaks his investigation off just 
where its difficulties begin  
The annual process of reproduction is easily understood so long as we keep in view merely the 
sum total of the years production But every single component of this product must be brought 
into the market as a commodity and there the difficulty begins The movements of the individual 
capitals and of the personal revenues cross and intermingle and are lost in the general change of 
places  in  the  circulation  of  the  wealth  of  society  this  dazes  the  sight  and  propounds  very 
complicated problems for solution In the third part of Book II I shall give the analysis of the real 
bearings  of  the  facts  It  is  one  of  the  great  merits  of  the  Physiocrats  that  in  their  Tableau 
conomique they were the first to attempt to depict the annual production in the shape in which it 
is presented to us after passing through the process of circulation  
For the rest it is a matter of course that Political Economy acting in the interests of the capitalist 
class has not failed to exploit the doctrine of Adam Smith viz that the whole of that part of the 
surplusproduct which is converted into capital is consumed by the working class  

 

 

 

Chapter  

Section   Separation of SurplusValue into Capital and 

Revenue The Abstinence Theory 

In the last preceding chapter we treated surplusvalue or the surplusproduct solely as a fund for 
supplying the individual consumption of the capitalist In this chapter we have so far treated it 
solely  as  a  fund  for  accumulation  It  is  however  neither  the  one  nor  the  other  but  is  both 
together One portion is consumed by the capitalist as revenue the other is employed as capital 
is accumulated  
Given the mass of surplusvalue then the larger the one of these parts the smaller is the other 
Caeteris paribus the ratio of these parts determines the magnitude of the accumulation But it is 
by  the  owner  of  the  surplusvalue  by  the  capitalist  alone  that  the  division  is  made  It  is  his 
deliberate act That part of the tribute exacted by him which he accumulates is said to be saved 
by  him  because  he  does  not  eat  it  ie  because  he  performs  the  function  of  a  capitalist  and 
enriches himself  
Except as personified capital the capitalist has no historical value and no right to that historical 
existence which to use an expression of the witty Lichnowsky hasnt got no date And so far 
only is the necessity for his own transitory existence implied in the transitory necessity for the 
capitalist mode of production But so far as he is personified capital it is not values in use and 
the  enjoyment  of  them  but  exchangevalue  and  its  augmentation  that  spur  him  into  action 
Fanatically bent on making value expand itself he ruthlessly forces the human race to produce for 
productions  sake  he  thus  forces  the  development  of  the  productive  powers  of  society  and 
creates those material conditions which alone can form the real basis of a higher form of society 
a society in which the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle 
Only  as  personified  capital  is  the  capitalist  respectable  As  such  he  shares  with  the  miser  the 
passion  for  wealth  as  wealth  But  that  which  in  the  miser  is  a  mere  idiosyncrasy  is  in  the 
capitalist the effect of the social mechanism of which he is but one of the wheels Moreover the 
development of capitalist production makes it constantly necessary to keep increasing the amount 
of  the  capital  laid  out  in  a  given  industrial  undertaking  and  competition  makes  the  immanent 
laws of capitalist production to be felt by each individual capitalist as external coercive laws It 
compels  him  to  keep  constantly  extending  his  capital  in  order  to  preserve  it but  extend  it  he 
cannot except by means of progressive accumulation  
So  far  therefore  as  his  actions  are  a  mere  function  of  capital    endowed  as  capital  is  in  his 
person with consciousness and a will  his own private consumption is a robbery perpetrated on 
accumulation just as in bookkeeping by double entry the private expenditure of the capitalist is 
placed  on  the  debtor  side  of  his  account  against  his  capital  To  accumulate  is  to  conquer  the 
world of social wealth to increase the mass of human beings exploited by him and thus to extend 
both the direct and the indirect sway of the capitalist  
But  original  sin  is  at  work  everywhere  As  capitalist  production  accumulation  and  wealth 
become developed the capitalist ceases to be the mere incarnation of capital He has a fellow
feeling  for  his  own  Adam  and  his  education  gradually  enables  him  to  smile  at  the  rage  for 
asceticism as a mere prejudice of the oldfashioned miser While the capitalist of the classical 
type  brands  individual  consumption  as  a  sin  against  his  function  and  as  abstinence  from 
accumulating the modernised capitalist is capable of looking upon accumulation as abstinence 
from pleasure  

Two souls alas do dwell with in his breast 
The one is ever parting from the other  

 

 

Chapter  
 
At the historical dawn of capitalist production  and every capitalist upstart has personally to go 
through  this  historical  stage    avarice  and  desire  to  get  rich  are  the  ruling  passions  But  the 
progress of capitalist production not only creates a world of delights it lays open in speculation 
and  the  credit  system  a  thousand  sources  of  sudden  enrichment  When  a  certain  stage  of 
development has been reached a conventional degree of prodigality which is also an exhibition 
of wealth and consequently a source of credit becomes a business necessity to the unfortunate 
capitalist Luxury enters into capitals expenses of representation Moreover the capitalist gets 
rich not like the miser in proportion to his personal labour and restricted consumption but at the 
same rate as he squeezes out the labourpower of others and enforces on the labourer abstinence 
from all lifes enjoyments Although therefore the prodigality of the capitalist never possesses 
the  bona  fide  character  of  the  openhanded  feudal  lords  prodigality  but  on  the  contrary  has 
always  lurking  behind  it  the  most  sordid  avarice  and  the  most  anxious  calculation  yet  his 
expenditure grows with his accumulation without the one necessarily restricting the other But 
along  with  this  growth  there  is  at  the  same  time  developed  in  his  breast  a  Faustian  conflict 
between the passion for accumulation and the desire for enjoyment  
Dr Aikin says in a work published in  

The trade of Manchester may be divided into four periods First when 
manufacturers were obliged to work hard for their livelihood  

They  enriched  themselves  chiefly  by  robbing  the  parents  whose  children  were  bound  as 
apprentices to them the parents paid a high premium while the apprentices were starved On the 
other hand the average profits were low and to accumulate extreme parsimony was requisite 
They lived like misers and were far from consuming even the interest on their capital 

The second period when they had begun to acquire little fortunes but worked as 
hard as before  for direct exploitation of labour costs labour as every slave
driver knows  and lived in as plain a manner as before The third when luxury 
began and the trade was pushed by sending out riders for orders into every market 
town in the Kingdom It is probable that few or no capitals of  to  
acquired by trade existed here before  However about that time or a little 
later the traders had got money beforehand and began to build modern brick 
houses instead of those of wood and plaster  

Even  in  the  early  part  of  the  th  century  a  Manchester  manufacturer  who  placed  a  pint  of 
foreign  wine  before  his  guests  exposed  himself  to  the  remarks  and  headshakings  of  all  his 
neighbours  Before  the  rise  of  machinery  a  manufacturers  evening  expenditure  at  the  public 
house where they all met never exceeded sixpence for a glass of punch and a penny for a screw 
of  tobacco  It  was  not  till    and  this  marks  an  epoch  that  a  person  actually  engaged  in 
business was seen with an equipage of his own 

The fourth period the last  years of the th century is that in which 
expense and luxury have made great progress and was supported by a trade 
extended by means of riders and factors through every part of Europe  

What would the good Dr Aikin say if he could rise from his grave and see the Manchester of 
today  
Accumulate accumulate That is Moses and the prophets Industry furnishes the material which 
saving  accumulates  Therefore  save  save  ie  reconvert  the  greatest  possible  portion  of 
surplusvalue or surplusproduct into capital Accumulation for accumulations sake production 
for productions sake by this formula classical economy expressed the historical mission of the 
bourgeoisie and did not for a single instant deceive itself over the birththroes of wealth But 

 

 

Chapter  
 
what avails lamentation in the face of historical necessity If to classical economy the proletarian 
is but a machine for the production of surplusvalue on the other hand the capitalist is in its eyes 
only a machine for the conversion of this surplusvalue into additional capital Political Economy 
takes the historical function of the capitalist in bitter earnest In order to charm out of his bosom 
the awful conflict between the desire for enjoyment and the chase after riches Malthus about the 
year    advocated  a  division  of  labour  which  assigns  to  the  capitalist  actually  engaged  in 
production  the  business  of  accumulating  and  to  the  other  sharers  in  surplusvalue  to  the 
landlords the placemen the beneficed clergy c the business of spending It is of the highest 
importance he says 

to keep separate the passion for expenditure and the passion for accumulation  

The  capitalists  having  long  been  good  livers  and  men  of  the  world  uttered  loud  cries  What 
exclaimed one of their spokesmen a disciple of Ricardo Mr Malthus preaches high rents heavy 
taxes  c  so  that  the  pressure  of  the  spur  may  constantly  be  kept  on  the  industrious  by 
unproductive consumers By all means production production on a constantly increasing scale 
runs the shibboleth but 

production will by such a process be far more curbed in than spurred on Nor is 
it quite fair thus to maintain in idleness a number of persons only to pinch others 
who are likely from their characters if you can force them to work to work with 
success  

Unfair as he finds it to spur on the industrial capitalist by depriving his bread of its butter yet he 
thinks it necessary to reduce the labourers wages to a minimum to keep him industrious Nor 
does he for a moment conceal the fact that the appropriation of unpaid labour is the secret of 
surplusvalue  

Increased demand on the part of the labourers means nothing more than their 
willingness to take less of their own product for themselves and leave a greater 
part of it to their employers and if it be said that this begets glut by lessening 
consumption on the part of the labourers I can only reply that glut is 
synonymous with large profits  

The learned disputation how the booty pumped out of the labourer may be divided with most 
advantage to accumulation between the industrial capitalist and the rich idler was hushed in face 
of the revolution of July Shortly afterwards the town proletariat at Lyons sounded the tocsin of 
revolution and the country proletariat in England began to set fire to farmyards and cornstacks 
On  this  side  of  the  Channel  Owenism  began  to  spread  on  the  other  side  St  Simonism  and 
Fourierism  The  hour  of  vulgar  economy  had  struck  Exactly  a  year  before  Nassau  W  Senior 
discovered at Manchester that the profit including interest of capital is the product of the last 
hour of the twelve he had announced to the world another discovery 

I substitute he proudly says for the word capital considered as an instrument 
of production the word abstinence  

An unparalleled sample this of the discoveries of vulgar economy It substitutes for an economic 
category a sycophantic phrase  voil tout thats all 

When the savage says Senior makes bows he exercises an industry but he 
does not practise abstinence  

This  explains  how  and  why  in  the  earlier  states  of  society  the  implements  of  labour  were 
fabricated without abstinence on the part of the capitalist 

The more society progresses the more abstinence is demanded  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Namely from those who ply the industry of appropriating the fruits of others industry All the 
conditions  for  carrying  on  the  labour  process  are  suddenly  converted  into  so  many  acts  of 
abstinence  on  the  part  of  the  capitalist  If  the  corn  is  not  all  eaten  but  part  of it  also  sown   
abstinence of the capitalist If the wine gets time to mature  abstinence of the capitalist The 
capitalist robs his own self whenever he lends  the instruments of production to the labourer 
that is whenever by incorporating labourpower with them he uses them to extract surplusvalue 
out  of  that  labourpower  instead  of  eating  them  up  steamengines  cotton  railways  manure 
horses and all or as the vulgar economist childishly puts it instead of dissipating their value in 
luxuries and other articles of consumption How the capitalists as a class are to perform that 
feat is a secret that vulgar economy has hitherto obstinately refused to divulge Enough that the 
world still jogs on solely through the selfchastisement of this modern penitent of Vishnu the 
capitalist Not only accumulation but the simple conservation of a capital requires a constant 
effort  to  resist  the  temptation  of  consuming  it  The  simple  dictates  of  humanity  therefore 
plainly enjoin the release of the capitalist from this martyrdom and temptation in the same way 
that the Georgian slaveowner was lately delivered by the abolition of slavery from the painful 
dilemma  whether  to  squander  the  surplusproduct  lashed  out  of  his  niggers  entirely  in 
champagne or whether to reconvert a part of it into more niggers and more land  
In  economic  forms  of  society  of  the  most  different  kinds  there  occurs  not  only  simple 
reproduction  but  in  varying  degrees  reproduction  on  a  progressively  increasing  scale  By 
degrees  more  is  produced  and  more  consumed  and  consequently  more  products  have  to  be 
converted  into  means  of  production  This  process  however  does  not  present  itself  as 
accumulation of capital nor as the function of a capitalist so long as the labourers means of 
production  and  with  them  his  product  and  means  of  subsistence  do  not  confront  him  in  the 
shape of capital Richard Jones who died a few years ago and was the successor of Malthus in 
the chair of Political Economy at Haileybury College discusses this point well in the light of two 
important facts Since the great mass of the Hindu population are peasants cultivating their land 
themselves their products their instruments of labour and means of subsistence never take the 
shape of a fund saved from revenue which fund has therefore gone through a previous process 
of accumulation On the other hand the nonagricultural labourers in those provinces where 
the English rule has least disturbed the old system are directly employed by the magnates to 
whom a portion of the agricultural surplusproduct is rendered in the shape of tribute or rent One 
portion of this product is consumed by the magnates in kind another is converted for their use 
by the labourers into articles of luxury and such like things while the rest forms the wages of the 
labourers  who  own  their  implements  of  labour  Here  production  and  reproduction  on  a 
progressively increasing scale go on their way without any intervention from that queer saint 
that knight of the woeful countenance the capitalist abstainer

The  proportion  in  which  surplusvalue  breaks  up  into  capital  and  revenue  being  given  the 
magnitude of the capital accumulated clearly depends on the absolute magnitude of the surplus
value  Suppose  that    per  cent  were  capitalised  and    per  cent  eaten  up  the  accumulated 
capital will be  or  according as the total surplusvalue has amounted to  or 
 Hence all the circumstances that determine the mass of surplusvalue operate to determine 
the magnitude of the accumulation We sum them up once again but only in so far as they afford 
new points of view in regard to accumulation  
It will be remembered that the rate of surplusvalue depends in the first place on the degree of 
exploitation of labourpower Political Economy  values this fact so highly that it occasionally 
identifies  the  acceleration  of  accumulation  due  to  increased  productiveness  of  labour  with  its 
acceleration due to increased exploitation of the labourer In the chapters on the production of 
surplusvalue it was constantly presupposed that wages are at least equal to the value of labour
power Forcible reduction of wages below this value plays however in practice too important a 
part for us not to pause upon it for a moment It in fact transforms within certain limits the 
labourers necessary consumption fund into a fund for the accumulation of capital  

Wages says John Stuart Mill have no productive power they are the price of 
a productive power Wages do not contribute along with labour to the production 
of commodities no more than the price of tools contributes along with the tools 
themselves If labour could be had without purchase wages might be dispensed 
with  

But if the labourers could live on air they could not be bought at any price The zero of their cost 
is  therefore  a  limit  in  a  mathematical  sense  always  beyond  reach  although  we  can  always 
approximate more and more nearly to it The constant tendency of capital is to force the cost of 
labour back towards this zero A writer of the th century often quoted already the author of the 
Essay on Trade and Commerce only betrays the innermost secret soul of English capitalism 
when he declares the historic mission of England to be the forcing down of English wages to the 
level of the French and the Dutch With other things he says naively 

But if our poor technical term for labourers will live luxuriously  then 
labour must of course be dear  When it is considered what luxuries the 
manufacturing populace consume such as brandy gin tea sugar foreign fruit 
strong beer printed linens snuff tobacco c  

He quotes the work of a Northamptonshire manufacturer who with eyes squinting heavenward 
moans 

Labour is onethird cheaper in France than in England for their poor work hard 
and fare hard as to their food and clothing Their chief diet is bread fruit herbs 
roots and dried fish for they very seldom eat flesh and when wheat is dear they 

 

 

 

Chapter  

eat very little bread To which may be added our essayist goes on that their 
drink is either water or other small liquors so that they spend very little money 
These things are very difficult to be brought about but they are not impracticable 
since they have been effected both in France and in Holland  

Twenty  years  later  an  American  humbug  the  baronised  Yankee  Benjamin  Thompson  alias 
Count Rumford followed the same line of philanthropy to the great satisfaction of God and man 
His Essays are a cookery book with receipts of all kinds for replacing by some succedaneum 
the ordinary dear food of the labourer The following is a particularly successful receipt of this 
wonderful philosopher

d salt d vinegar d pepper and sweet herbs in all  make a soup for  
men and at the medium price of barley and of Indian corn  this soup may be 
provided at d the portion of  ounces  

With the advance of capitalistic production the adulteration of food rendered Thompsons ideal 
superfluous At the end of the th and during the first ten years of the th century the English 
farmers  and  landlords  enforced  the  absolute  minimum  of  wage  by  paying  the  agricultural 
labourers  less  than  the  minimum  in  the  form  of  wages  and  the  remainder  in  the  shape  of 
parochial relief An example of the waggish way in which the English Dogberries acted in their 
legal fixing of a wages tariff 

The squires of Norfolk had dined says Mr Burke when they fixed the rate of 
wages the squires of Berks evidently thought the labourers ought not to do so 
when they fixed the rate of wages at Speenhamland  There they decide 
that income weekly should be s for a man when the gallon or halfpeck loaf 
of  lbs  oz is at s and increase regularly till bread is s d when it is 
above that sum decrease regularly till it be at s and then his food should be  
th less  

Before  the  Committee  of  Inquiry  of  the  House  of  Lords    a  certain  A  Bennett  a  large

Has any proportion of the value of daily labour been made up to the labourers out 
of the poors rate Answer Yes it has the weekly income of every family is 
made up to the gallon loaf  lbs  oz and d per head The gallon loaf per 
week is what we suppose sufficient for the maintenance of every person in the 
family for the week and the d is for clothes and if the parish think proper to 
find clothes the d is deducted This practice goes through all the western part of 
Wiltshire and I believe throughout the country For years exclaims a 
bourgeois author of that time they the farmers have degraded a respectable 
class of their countrymen by forcing them to have recourse to the workhouse  
the farmer while increasing his own gains has prevented any accumulation on the 
part of his labouring dependents  

The part played in our days by the direct robbery from the labourers necessary consumption fund 
in  the  formation  of  surplusvalue  and  therefore  of  the  accumulation  fund  of  capital  the  so
called domestic industry has served to show Ch xv sect  c Further facts on this subject will 
be given later  
Although in all branches of industry that part of the constant capital consisting of instruments of 
labour must be sufficient for a certain number of labourers determined by the magnitude of the 
undertaking it by no means always necessarily increases in the same proportion as the quantity 

 

 

ie 

Chapter  
 
of labour employed In a factory suppose that  labourers working  hours a day yield  
workinghours  If  the  capitalist  wishes  to  raise  this  sum  by  one  half  he  can  employ    more 
workers but then he must also advance more capital not merely for wages but for instruments of 
labour  But  he  might  also  let  the    labourers  work    hours  instead  of    and  then  the 
instruments of labour already to hand would be enough These would then simply be more rapidly 
consumed Thus additional labour begotten of the greater tension of labourpower can augment 
surplusproduct  and  surplusvalue 
the  subjectmatter  of  accumulation  without 
corresponding augmentation in the constant part of capital  
In the extractive industries mines c the raw materials form no part of the capital advanced 
The subject of labour is in this case not a product of previous labour but is furnished by Nature 
gratis  as  in  the  case  of  metals  minerals  coal  stone  c  In  these  cases  the  constant  capital 
consists almost exclusively of instruments of labour which can very well absorb an increased 
quantity of labour day and night shifts of labourers eg All other things being equal the mass 
and value of the product will rise in direct proportion to the labour expended As on the first day 
of production the original produceformers now turned into the creators of the material elements 
of capital  man and Nature  still work together Thanks to the elasticity of labourpower the 
domain of accumulation has extended without any previous enlargement of constant capital  
In agriculture the land under cultivation cannot be increased without the advance of more seed 
and  manure  But  this  advance  once  made  the  purely  mechanical  working  of  the  soil  itself 
produces a marvellous effect on the amount of the product A greater quantity of labour done by 
the same number of labourers as before thus increases the fertility without requiring any new 
advance in the instruments of labour It is once again the direct action of man on Nature which 
becomes  an  immediate  source  of  greater  accumulation  without  the  intervention  of  any  new 
capital  
Finally  in  what  is  called  manufacturing  industry  every  additional  expenditure  of  labour 
presupposes  a  corresponding  additional  expenditure  of  raw  materials  but  not  necessarily  of 
instruments of labour And as extractive industry and agriculture supply manufacturing industry 
with its raw materials and those of its instruments of labour the additional product the former 
have created without additional advance of capital tells also in favour of the latter  
General result by incorporating with itself the two primary creators of wealth labourpower and 
the  land  capital  acquires  a  power  of  expansion  that  permits  it  to  augment  the  elements  of  its 
accumulation beyond the limits apparently fixed by its own magnitude or by the value and the 
mass of the means of production already produced in which it has its being  
Another  important  factor in  the  accumulation  of  capital is the  degree  of  productivity  of  social 
labour  
With the productive power of labour increases the mass of the products in which a certain value 
and  therefore  a  surplusvalue  of  a  given  magnitude  is  embodied  The  rate  of  surplusvalue 
remaining  the  same  or  even  falling  so  long  as  it  only  falls  more  slowly  than  the  productive 
power of labour rises the mass of the surplusproduct increases The division of this product into 
revenue  and  additional  capital  remaining  the  same  the  consumption  of  the  capitalist  may 
therefore increase without any decrease in the fund of accumulation The relative magnitude of 
the  accumulation  fund  may  even  increase  at  the  expense  of  the  consumption  fund  whilst  the 
cheapening of commodities places at the disposal of the capitalist as many means of enjoyment as 
formerly  or  even  more  than  formerly  But  handinhand  with  the  increasing  productivity  of 
labour goes as we have seen the cheapening of the labourer therefore a higher rate of surplus
value even when the real wages are rising The latter never rise proportionally to the productive 
power  of  labour  The  same  value  in  variable  capital  therefore  sets  in  movement  more  labour
 

 

Chapter  
 
power  and  therefore  more  labour  The  same  value  in  constant  capital  is  embodied  in  more 
means  of  production  ie  in  more  instruments  of  labour  materials  of  labour  and  auxiliary 
materials it therefore also supplies more elements for the production both of use value and of 
value  and  with these  more  absorbers  of labour The  value  of  the  additional  capital therefore 
remaining the same or even diminishing accelerated accumulation still takes place Not only does 
the scale of reproduction materially extend but the production of surplusvalue increases more 
rapidly than the value of the additional capital  
The  development  of the  productive  power  of labour  reacts  also on the original  capital  already 
engaged  in  the  process  of  production  A  part  of  the  functioning  constant  capital  consists  of 
instruments  of  labour  such  as  machinery  c  which  are  not  consumed  and  therefore  not 
reproduced or replaced by new ones of the same kind until after long periods of time But every 
year a part of these instruments of labour perishes or reaches the limit of its productive function 
It reaches therefore in that year the time for its periodical reproduction for its replacement by 
new  ones  of  the  same  kind  If  the  productiveness  of  labour  has  during  the  using  up  of  these 
instruments of labour increased and it develops continually with the uninterrupted advance of 
science  and  technology  more  efficient  and  considering  their  increased  efficiency  cheaper 
machines  tools  apparatus  c  replace  the  old  The  old  capital  is  reproduced  in  a  more 
productive form apart from the constant detail improvements in the instruments of labour already 
in use The other part of the constant capital raw material and auxiliary substances is constantly 
reproduced in less than a year those produced by agriculture for the most part annually Every 
introduction of improved methods therefore works almost simultaneously on the new capital and 
on that already in action Every advance in Chemistry not only multiplies the number of useful 
materials and the useful applications of those already known thus extending with the growth of 
capital its sphere of investment It teaches at the same time how to throw the excrements of the 
processes  of  production  and  consumption  back  again  into  the  circle  of  the  process  of 
reproduction  and  thus  without  any  previous  outlay  of  capital  creates  new  matter  for  capital 
Like the increased exploitation of natural wealth by the mere increase in the tension of labour
power  science  and  technology  give  capital  a  power  of  expansion  independent  of  the  given 
magnitude  of  the  capital  actually  functioning  They  react  at  the  same  time  on  that  part  of  the 
original capital which has entered upon its stage of renewal This in passing into its new shape 
incorporates gratis the social advance made while its old shape was being used up Of course this 
development of productive power is accompanied by a partial depreciation of functioning capital 
So  far  as  this  depreciation  makes  itself  acutely  felt  in  competition  the  burden  falls  on  the 
labourer in the increased exploitation of whom the capitalist looks for his indemnification  
Labour transmits to its product the value of the means of production consumed by it On the other 
hand the value and mass of the means of production set in motion by a given quantity of labour 
increase as the labour becomes more productive Though the same quantity of labour adds always 
to  its  products only  the  same  sum  of  new  value  still  the  old capital  value  transmitted  by  the 
labour to the products increases with the growing productivity of labour  
An  English  and  a  Chinese  spinner  eg  may  work  the  same  number  of  hours  with  the  same 
intensity  then  they  will  both  in  a  week  create  equal  values  But  in  spite  of  this  equality  an 
immense difference will obtain between the value of the weeks product of the Englishman who 
works with a mighty automaton and that of the Chinaman who has but a spinningwheel In the 
same time as the Chinaman spins one pound of cotton the Englishman spins several hundreds of 
pounds A sum many hundred times as great of old values swells the value of his product in 
which those reappear in a new useful form and can thus function anew as capital 

 

 

 

Chapter  

In  as Frederick Engels teaches us all the wool crop in England of the 
three preceding years lay untouched for want of labourers and so it must have 
lain if newly invented machinery had not come to its aid and spun it  

Labour embodied in the form of machinery of course did not directly force into life a single man 
but it made it possible for a smaller number of labourers with the addition of relatively less living 
labour not only to consume the wool productively and put into it new value but to preserve in 
the  form  of  yarn  c  its  old  value  At  the  same  time  it  caused  and  stimulated  increased 
reproduction of wool It is the natural property of living labour to transmit old value whilst it 
creates new Hence with the increase in efficacy extent and value of its means of production 
consequently with the accumulation that accompanies the development of its productive power 
labour  keeps  up  and  eternises  an  always  increasing  capital  value  in  a  form  ever  new  This 
natural  power  of labour  takes  the  appearance  of  an intrinsic property  of capital  in  which it  is 
incorporated  just  as  the  productive  forces  of  social  labour  take  the  appearance  of  inherent 
properties of capital and as the constant appropriation of surplus labour by the capitalists takes 
that of a constant selfexpansion of capital  
With  the  increase  of  capital  the  difference  between  the  capital  employed  and  the  capital 
consumed increases In other words there is increase in the value and the material mass of the 
instruments  of  labour  such  as  buildings  machinery  drainpipes  workingcattle  apparatus  of 
every  kind  that  function  for  a  longer  or  shorter  time  in  processes  of  production  constantly 
repeated or that serve for the attainment of particular useful effects whilst they themselves only 
gradually wear out therefore only lose their value piecemeal therefore transfer that value to the 
product only bit by bit In the same proportion as these instruments of labour serve as product
formers  without  adding  value  to  the  product  ie  in  the  same  proportion  as  they  are  wholly 
employed but only partly consumed they perform as we saw earlier the same gratuitous service 
as  the  natural  forces  water  steam  air  electricity  etc  This  gratuitous  service  of  past  labour 
when  seized  and  filled  with  a  soul  by  living  labour  increases  with  the  advancing  stages  of 
accumulation  
Since past labour always disguises itself as capital ie since the passive of the labour of A B C 
etc takes the form of the active of the nonlabourer X bourgeois and political economists are 
full of praises of the services of dead and gone labour which according to the Scotch genius 
MacCulloch ought to receive a special remuneration in the shape of interest profit etc The 
powerful and everincreasing assistance given by past labour to the living labour process under 
the form of means of production is therefore attributed to that form of past labour in which it is 
alienated as unpaid labour from the worker himself ie to its capitalistic form The practical 
agents of capitalistic production and their pettifogging ideologists are as unable to think of the 
means of production as separate from the antagonistic social mask they wear today as a slave
owner to think of the worker himself as distinct from his character as a slave  
With a given degree of exploitation of labourpower the mass of the surplusvalue produced is 
determined by the number of workers simultaneously exploited and this corresponds although in 
varying proportions with the magnitude of the capital The more therefore capital increases by 
means of successive accumulations the more does the sum of the value increase that is divided 
into consumption fund and accumulation fund The capitalist can therefore live a more jolly life 
and at the same time show more abstinence And finally all the springs of production act with 
greater elasticity the more its scale extends with the mass of the capital advanced

Section  The SoCalled Labour Fund 

It has been shown in the course of this inquiry that capital is not a fixed magnitude but is a part 
of social wealth elastic and constantly fluctuating with the division of fresh surplusvalue into 
revenue  and  additional  capital  It  has  been  seen  further  that  even  with  a  given  magnitude  of 
functioning capital the labourpower the science and the land by which are to be understood 
economically all conditions of labour furnished by Nature independently of man embodied in it 
form elastic powers of capital allowing it within certain limits a field of action independent of 
its  own  magnitude  In  this  inquiry  we  have  neglected  all  effects  of  the  process  of  circulation 
effects which may produce very different degrees of efficiency in the same mass of capital And 
as we presupposed the limits set by capitalist production that is to say presupposed the process 
of social production in a form developed by purely spontaneous growth we neglected any more 
rational combination directly and systematically practicable with the means of production and 
the  mass  of  labourpower  at  present  disposable  Classical  economy  always  loved  to  conceive 
social capital as a fixed magnitude of a fixed degree of efficiency But this prejudice was first 
established as a dogma by the archPhilistine Jeremy Bentham that insipid pedantic leather
tongued oracle of the ordinary bourgeois intelligence of the th century Bentham is among 
philosophers what Martin Tupper is among poets Both could only have been manufactured in 
England In the light of his dogma the commonest phenomena of the process of production as 
eg  its  sudden  expansions  and  contractions  nay  even  accumulation  itself  become  perfectly 
inconceivable  The dogma was used by Bentham himself as well as by Malthus James Mill 
MacCulloch  etc  for  an  apologetic  purpose  and  especially  in  order  to  represent  one  part  of 
capital namely variable capital or that part convertible into labourpower as a fixed magnitude 
The material of variable capital ie the mass of the means of subsistence it represents for the 
labourer or the socalled labour fund was fabled as a separate part of social wealth fixed by 
natural laws and unchangeable To set in motion the part of social wealth which is to function as 
constant capital or to express it in a material form as means of production a definite mass of 
living  labour  is  required  This  mass  is  given  technologically  But  neither  is  the  number  of 
labourers required to render fluid this mass of labourpower given it changes with the degree of 
exploitation of the individual labourpower nor is the price of this labourpower given but only 
its minimum limit which is moreover very variable The facts that lie at the bottom of this dogma 
are these on the one hand the labourer has no right to interfere in the division of social wealth 
into means of enjoyment for the nonlabourer and means of production On the other hand only 
in favourable and exceptional cases has he the power to enlarge the socalled labour fund at the 
expense of the revenue of the wealthy  
What silly tautology results from the attempt to represent the capitalistic limits of the labour fund 
as its natural and social limits may be seen eg in Professor Fawcett  

The circulating capital of a country he says is its wagefund Hence if we 
desire to calculate the average money wages received by each labourer we have 
simply to divide the amount of this capital by the number of the labouring 
population  

That is to say we first add together the individual wages actually paid and then we affirm that 
the sum thus obtained forms the total value of the labour fund determined and vouchsafed to us 
by God and Nature Lastly we divide the sum thus obtained by the number of labourers to find 
out again how much may come to each on the average An uncommonly knowing dodge this It 
did not prevent Mr Fawcett saying in the same breath 

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  aggregate  wealth  which  is  annually  saved  in  England  is  divided  into  two  portions  one 
portion  is  employed  as  capital  to  maintain  our  industry  and  the  other  portion  is  exported  to 
foreign  countries  Only  a  portion  and  perhaps  not  a  large  portion  of  the  wealth  which  is 
annually saved in this country is invested in our own industry  
The greater part of the yearly accruing surplusproduct embezzled because abstracted without 
return of an equivalent from the English labourer is thus used as capital not in England but in 
foreign  countries  But  with  the  additional  capital  thus  exported  a  part  of  the  labour  fund 
invented by God and Bentham is also exported

 The reader will notice that the word revenue is used in a double sense first to designate surplus
value so far as it is the fruit periodically yielded by capital secondly to designate the part of that fruit 
which  is  periodically  consumed  by  the  capitalist  or  added  to  the  fund  that  supplies  his  private 
consumption  I  have  retained  this  double  meaning  because  it  harmonises  with  the  language  of  the

 Classic economy has on account of a deficient analysis of the labour process and of the process of 
creating  value  never  properly  grasped  this  weighty  element  of  reproduction  as  may  be  seen  in 
Ricardo he says eg whatever the change in productive power a million men always produce in 
manufactures the same value This is accurate if the extension and degree of intensity of their labour 
are given But it does not prevent this Ricardo overlooks in certain conclusions he draws a million 
men with different powers of productivity in their labour turning into products very different masses 
of the means of production and therefore preserving in their products very different masses of value 
in consequence of which the values of the products yielded may vary considerably Ricardo has it 
may be noted in passing tried in vain to make clear to J B Say by that very example the difference 
between use value which he here calls wealth or material riches and exchangevalue Say answers 
Quant  la difficult qulve Mr Ricardo en disant que par des procds mieux entendus un million 
de personnes peuvent produire deux fois trois fois autant de richesses sans produire plus de valeurs 
cette  difficult  nest  pas  une  lorsque  lon  considre  ainsi  quon  le  doit  la  production  comme  un 
change dans lequel on donne les services productifs de son travail de sa terre et de ses capitaux 
pour obtenir des produits Cest par le moyen de ces services productifs que nous acqurons tous les 
produits  qui  sont  au  monde  Or  nous  sommes  dautant  plus  riches  nos  services  productifs  ont 
dautant plus de valeur quils obtiennent dans lchange appel production une plus grande quantit de 
choses utiles As for the difficulty raised by Ricardo when he says that by using better methods of 
production a million people can produce two or three times as much wealth without producing any 
more value this difficulty disappears when one bears in mind as one should that production is like an 
exchange in which a man contributes the productive services of his labour his land and his capital in 
order to obtain products It is by means of these productive services that we acquire all the products 
existing in the world Therefore  we are richer our productive services have the  more  value the 
greater the quantity of useful things they bring in through the exchange which is called production J 
B Say Lettres  M Malthus Paris  pp   The difficult  it exists for him not for 
Ricardo  that Say  means to clear up is this Why does not the exchangevalue of the use values 
increase  when  their  quantity  increases  in  consequence  of  increased  productive  power  of  labour 
Answer the difficulty is met by calling use value exchangevalue if you please Exchangevalue is a 
thing  that  is  connected  one  way  or  another  with  exchange  If  therefore  production  is  called  an 
exchange  of  labour  and  means  of production  against  the  product  it  is  clear  as  day  that  you  obtain 
more exchangevalue in proportion as the production yields more use value In other words the more 
use  values  eg  stockings  a  working  day  yields  to  the  stockingmanufacturer  the  richer  is  he  in 
stockings Suddenly however Say recollects that with a greater quantity of stockings their price 
which of course has nothing to do with their exchangevalue falls parce que la concurrence les les 
producteurs oblige  donner les produits pour ce quils leur cotent because competition obliges 
them the producers to sell their products for what they cost to make But whence does the profit

come  if  the  capitalist  sells  the  commodities  at  costprice  Never  mind  Say  declares  that  in 
consequence of increased productivity every one now receives in return for a given equivalent two 
pairs of stockings instead of one as before The result he arrives at is precisely that proposition of 
Ricardo that he aimed at disproving After this mighty effort of thought he triumphantly apostrophises

capital annually transported abroad to be put out at interest is in much greater proportion to the annual 
accumulation than the yearly emigration is to the yearly increase of population 

 

 

Chapter  The General Law of Capitalist 

Accumulation 

Section  The Increased Demand for labour power that 

Accompanies Accumulation the Composition of Capital 

Remaining the same 

In this chapter we consider the influence of the growth of capital on the lot of the labouring class 
The  most  important  factor  in  this  inquiry  is  the  composition  of  capital  and  the  changes  it 
undergoes in the course of the process of accumulation  
The composition of capital is to be understood in a twofold sense On the side of value it is 
determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of 
production and variable capital or value of labour power the sum total of wages On the side of 
material  as  it  functions  in  the  process  of  production  all  capital  is  divided  into  means  of 
production and living labour power This latter composition is determined by the relation between 
the mass of the means of production employed on the one hand and the mass of labour necessary 
for their employment on the other I call the former the valuecomposition the latter the technical 
composition of capital  
Between  the  two  there  is  a  strict  correlation  To  express  this  I  call  the  value  composition  of 
capital in so far as it is determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the 
latter the organic composition of capital Wherever I refer to the composition of capital without 
further qualification its organic composition is always understood  
The many individual capitals invested in a particular branch of production have one with another 
more or less different compositions The average of their individual compositions gives us the 
composition of the total capital in this branch of production Lastly the average of these averages 
in all branches of production gives us the composition of the total social capital of a country and 
with this alone are we in the last resort concerned in the following investigation  
Growth  of  capital  involves  growth  of  its  variable  constituent  or  of  the  part  invested  in  labour 
power A part of the surplusvalue turned into additional capital must always be retransformed 
into  variable  capital  or  additional  labour  fund  If  we  suppose  that  all  other  circumstances 
remaining the same the composition of capital also remains constant ie that a definite mass of 
means of production constantly needs the same mass of labour power to set it in motion then the 
demand  for  labour  and  the  subsistencefund  of  the  labourers  clearly  increase  in  the  same 
proportion as the capital and the more rapidly the more rapidly the capital increases Since the 
capital produces yearly a surplusvalue of which one part is yearly added to the original capital 
since  this  increment  itself  grows  yearly  along  with  the  augmentation  of  the  capital  already 
functioning  since  lastly  under  special  stimulus  to  enrichment  such  as  the  opening  of  new 
markets or of new spheres for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social 
wants  c  the  scale  of  accumulation  may  be  suddenly  extended  merely  by  a  change  in  the 
division  of  the  surplusvalue  or  surplusproduct  into  capital  and  revenue  the  requirements  of 
accumulating capital may exceed the increase of labour power or of the number of labourers the 
demand for labourers may exceed the supply and therefore wages may rise This must indeed 
ultimately be the case if the conditions supposed above continue For since in each year more 
labourers are employed than in its predecessor sooner or later a point must be reached at which 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the customary supply of labour and therefore 
a rise of wages takes place A lamentation on this score was heard in England during the whole of 
the  fifteenth  and  the  first  half  of  the  eighteenth  centuries  The  more  or  less  favourable 
circumstances in which the wage working class supports and multiplies itself in no way alter the 
fundamental character of capitalist production As simple reproduction constantly reproduces the 
capital relation itself ie the relation of capitalists on the one hand and wage workers on the 
other so reproduction on a progressive scale ie accumulation reproduces the capital relation 
on a progressive scale more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole more wage workers at 
that The reproduction of a mass of labour power which must incessantly reincorporate itself 
with  capital  for  that  capitals  selfexpansion  which  cannot  get  free  from  capital  and  whose 
enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety of individual capitalists to whom it sells 
itself this reproduction of labour power forms in fact an essential of the reproduction of capital 
itself Accumulation of capital is therefore increase of the proletariat  
Classical economy grasped this fact so thoroughly that Adam Smith Ricardo c as mentioned 
earlier inaccurately identified accumulation with the consumption by the productive labourers 
of all the capitalised part of the surplusproduct or with its transformation into additional wage 
labourers As early as  John Bellers says 

For if one had a hundred thousand acres of land and as many pounds in money 
and as many cattle without a labourer what would the rich man be but a 
labourer And as the labourers make men rich so the more labourers there will 
be the more rich men  the labour of the poor being the mines of the rich  

So also Bernard de Mandeville at the beginning of the eighteenth century 

It would be easier where property is well secured to live without money than 
without poor for who would do the work  As they the poor ought to be kept 
from starving so they should receive nothing worth saving If here and there one 
of the lowest class by uncommon industry and pinching his belly lifts himself 
above the condition he was brought up in nobody ought to hinder him nay it is 
undeniably the wisest course for every person in the society and for every private 
family to be frugal but it is the interest of all rich nations that the greatest part of 
the poor should almost never be idle and yet continually spend what they get 
Those that get their living by their daily labour  have nothing to stir them up to 
be serviceable but their wants which it is prudence to relieve but folly to cure 
The only thing then that can render the labouring man industrious is a moderate 
quantity of money for as too little will according as his temper is either dispirit 
or make him desperate so too much will make him insolent and lazy From 
what has been said it is manifest that in a free nation where slaves are not 
allowed of the surest wealth consists in a multitude of laborious poor for besides 
that they are the neverfailing nursery of fleets and armies without them there 
could be no enjoyment and no product of any country could be valuable To 
make the society which of course consists of nonworkers happy and people 
easier under the meanest circumstances it is requisite that great numbers of them 
should be ignorant as well as poor knowledge both enlarges and multiplies our 
desires and the fewer things a man wishes for the more easily his necessities may 
be supplied  

What Mandeville an honest clearheaded man had not yet seen is that the mechanism of the 
process of accumulation itself increases along with the capital the mass of labouring poor ie 
the wage labourers who turn their labour power into an increasing power of selfexpansion of the 
 

Chapter  
 
growing  capital  and  even  by  doing  so  must  eternise  their  dependent  relation  on  their  own 
product as personified in the capitalists In reference to this relation of dependence Sir F M 
Eden in his The State of the Poor an History of the Labouring Classes in England says  

 

the natural produce of our soil is certainly not fully adequate to our subsistence 
we can neither be clothed lodged nor fed but in consequence of some previous 
labour A portion at least of the society must be indefatigably employed  There 
are others who though they neither toil nor spin can yet command the produce 
of industry but who owe their exemption from labour solely to civilisation and 
order  They are peculiarly the creatures of civil institutions which have 
recognised that individuals may acquire property by various other means besides 
the exertion of labour Persons of independent fortune  owe their superior 
advantages by no means to any superior abilities of their own but almost entirely 
 to the industry of others It is not the possession of land or of money but the 
command of labour which distinguishes the opulent from the labouring part of the 
community  This scheme approved by Eden would give the people of 
property sufficient but by no means too much influence and authority over those 
who  work for them and it would place such labourers not in an abject or 
servile condition but in such a state of easy and liberal dependence as all who 
know human nature and its history will allow to be necessary for their own 
comfort  

Sir F M Eden it may be remarked in passing is the only disciple of Adam Smith during the 
eighteenth century that produced any work of importance  
Under  the  conditions  of  accumulation  supposed  thus  far  which  conditions  are  those  most 
favourable to the labourers their relation of dependence upon capital takes on a form endurable 
or  as  Eden  says  easy  and  liberal  Instead  of  becoming  more  intensive  with  the  growth  of 
capital  this  relation  of  dependence  only  becomes  more  extensive  ie  the  sphere  of  capitals 
exploitation and rule merely extends with its own dimensions and the number of its subjects A 
larger  part  of  their  own  surplusproduct  always  increasing  and  continually  transformed  into 
additional capital comes back to them in the shape of means of payment so that they can extend 
the  circle  of their  enjoyments  can  make  some  additions  to  their  consumptionfund  of clothes 
furniture c and can lay by small reserve funds of money But just as little as better clothing 
food and treatment and a larger peculium do away with the exploitation of the slave so little do 
they  set  aside  that  of  the  wage  worker  A  rise  in  the  price  of  labour  as  a  consequence  of 
accumulation of capital only means in fact that the length and weight of the golden chain the 
wage  worker  has  already  forged  for  himself  allow  of  a  relaxation  of  the  tension  of  it  In  the 
controversies  on this  subject  the  chief  fact  has  generally  been  overlooked  viz  the  differentia 
specifica defining characteristic of capitalistic production Labour power is sold today not with 
a view of satisfying by its service or by its product the personal needs of the buyer His aim is 
augmentation of his capital production of commodities containing more labour than he pays for 
containing therefore a portion of value that costs him nothing and that is nevertheless realised 
when the commodities are sold Production of surplusvalue is the absolute law of this mode of 
production Labourpower is only saleable so far as it preserves the means of production in their 
capacity of capital reproduces its own value as capital and yields in unpaid labour a source of 
additional capital The conditions of its sale whether more or less favourable to the labourer 
include therefore the necessity of its constant reselling and the constantly extended reproduction 
of all wealth in the shape of capital Wages as we have seen by their very nature always imply 
the performance of a certain quantity of unpaid labour on the part of the labourer Altogether 

 

 

Chapter  
 
irrespective of the case of a rise of wages with a falling price of labour c such an increase only 
means at best a quantitative diminution of the unpaid labour that the worker has to supply This 
diminution  can  never reach  the  point  at  which  it  would  threaten the  system  itself  Apart from 
violent  conflicts  as  to  the  rate  of  wages  and  Adam  Smith  has  already  shown  that  in  such  a 
conflict taken on the whole the master is always master a rise in the price of labour resulting 
from accumulation of capital implies the following alternative  
Either the price of labour keeps on rising because its rise does not interfere with the progress of 
accumulation In this there is nothing wonderful for says Adam Smith after these profits are 
diminished stock may not only continue to increase but to increase much faster than before A 
great  stock  though  with  small  profits  generally  increases  faster  than  a small  stock  with  great 
profits l c ii p  In this case it is evident that a diminution in the unpaid labour in no way 
interferes  with  the  extension  of  the  domain  of  capital    Or  on  the  other  hand  accumulation 
slackens in consequence of the rise in the price of labour because the stimulus of gain is blunted 
The  rate  of  accumulation  lessens  but  with  its  lessening  the  primary  cause  of  that  lessening 
vanishes ie the disproportion between capital and exploitable labour power The mechanism of 
the process of capitalist production removes the very obstacles that it temporarily creates The 
price of labour falls again to a level corresponding with the needs of the selfexpansion of capital 
whether the level be below the same as or above the one which was normal before the rise of 
wages took place We see thus In the first case it is not the diminished rate either of the absolute 
or of the proportional increase in labour power or labouring population which causes capital to 
be  in  excess  but  conversely  the  excess  of  capital  that  makes  exploitable  labour  power 
insufficient  In  the  second  case  it  is  not  the  increased  rate  either  of  the  absolute  or  of  the 
proportional increase in labour power or labouring population that makes capital insufficient 
but  conversely  the relative  diminution  of  capital that  causes  the  exploitable  labour  power  or 
rather its price to be in excess It is these absolute movements of the accumulation of capital 
which are reflected as relative movements of the mass of exploitable labour power and therefore 
seem produced by the latters own independent movement To put it mathematically the rate of 
accumulation is the independent not the dependent variable the rate of wages the dependent 
not the independent variable Thus when the industrial cycle is in the phase of crisis a general 
fall in the price of commodities is expressed as a rise in the value of money and in the phase of 
prosperity a general rise in the price of commodities as a fall in the value of money The so
called currency school concludes from this that with high prices too much with low prices too 
little    money  is  in  circulation  Their  ignorance  and  complete  misunderstanding  of  facts    are 
worthily paralleled by the economists who interpret the above phenomena of accumulation by 
saying that there are now too few now too many wage labourers  
The  law  of  capitalist  production  that  is  at  the  bottom  of  the  pretended  natural  law  of 
population reduces itself simply to this The correlation between accumulation of capital and 
rate  of  wages  is  nothing  else  than  the  correlation  between  the  unpaid  labour  transformed  into 
capital  and  the  additional  paid  labour  necessary  for  the  setting  in  motion  of  this  additional 
capital It is therefore in no way a relation between two magnitudes independent one of the other 
on  the  one  hand  the  magnitude  of  the  capital  on  the  other  the  number  of  the  labouring 
population it is rather at bottom only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the 
same labouring population If the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working class and 
accumulated by the capitalist class increases so rapidly that its conversion into capital requires an 
extraordinary  addition  of  paid  labour  then  wages  rise  and  all  other  circumstances  remaining 
equal  the  unpaid  labour  diminishes  in  proportion  But  as  soon  as  this  diminution  touches  the 
point at which the surplus labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity a 

 

 

Chapter  
 
reaction sets in a smaller part of revenue is capitalised accumulation lags and the movement of 
rise in wages receives a check The rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only 
leave  intact  the  foundations  of  the  capitalistic  system  but  also  secure  its  reproduction  on  a 
progressive  scale  The  law  of  capitalistic  accumulation  metamorphosed  by  economists  into 
pretended law of Nature in reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation excludes 
every diminution in the degree of exploitation of labour and every rise in the price of labour 
which  could  seriously  imperil  the  continual  reproduction  on  an  everenlarging  scale  of  the 
capitalistic relation It cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the labourer exists to 
satisfy the needs of selfexpansion of existing values instead of on the contrary material wealth 
existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer As in religion man is 
governed by the products of his own brain so in capitalistic production he is governed by the 
products of his own hand  
Section  Relative Diminution of the Variable Part of Capital 
Simultaneously with the Progress of Accumulation and of 

the Concentration that Accompanies it 

According to the economists themselves it is neither the actual extent of social wealth nor the 
magnitude of the capital already functioning that lead to a rise of wages but only the constant 
growth of accumulation and the degree of rapidity of that growth Adam Smith Book I chapter 
 So far we have only considered one special phase of this process that in which the increase of 
capital  occurs  along  with  a  constant  technical  composition  of  capital  But  the  process  goes 
beyond this phase  
Once  given  the  general  basis  of the capitalistic system  then  in the course  of accumulation a 
point is reached at which the development of the productivity of social labour becomes the most 
powerful lever of accumulation 

The same cause says Adam Smith which raises the wages of labour the 
increase of stock tends to increase its productive powers and to make a smaller 
quantity of labour produce a greater quantity of work  

Apart from natural conditions such as fertility of the soil c and from the skill of independent 
and isolated producers shown rather qualitatively in the goodness than quantitatively in the mass 
of their  products  the degree  of  productivity  of labour in a  given  society  is  expressed  in  the 
relative extent of the means of production that one labourer during a given time with the same 
tension of labour power turns into products The mass of the means of production which he thus 
transforms increases with the productiveness of his labour But those means of production play a 
double  part  The  increase  of  some  is  a  consequence  that  of  the  others  a  condition  of  the 
increasing productivity of labour Eg with the division of labour in manufacture and with the 
use of machinery more raw material is worked up in the same time and therefore a greater mass 
of raw material and auxiliary substances enter into the labour process That is the consequence of 
the increasing productivity of labour On the other hand the mass of machinery beasts of burden 
mineral manures drainpipes c is a condition of the increasing productivity of labour So also 
is it with the means of production concentrated in buildings furnaces means of transport c 
But  whether  condition  or  consequence  the  growing  extent  of  the  means  of  production  as 
compared  with  the  labour  power  incorporated  with  them  is  an  expression  of  the  growing 
productiveness of labour The increase of the latter appears therefore in the diminution of the 
mass of labour in proportion to the mass of means of production moved by it or in the diminution 
of the subjective factor of the labour process as compared with the objective factor  
 

 

Chapter  
 
This  change  in  the  technical  composition  of  capital  this  growth  in  the  mass  of  means  of 
production as compared with the mass of the labour power that vivifies them is reflected again 
in its value composition by the increase of the constant constituent of capital at the expense of its 
variable constituent There may be eg originally  per cent of a capital laid out in means of 
production and  per cent in labour power later on with the development of the productivity 
of labour  per cent in means of production  per cent in labour power and so on This law 
of the progressive increase in constant capital in proportion to the variable is confirmed at every 
step as already shown by the comparative analysis of the prices of commodities whether we 
compare  different  economic  epochs  or  different  nations  in  the  same  epoch  The  relative 
magnitude of the element of price which represents the value of the means of production only or 
the constant part of capital consumed is in direct the relative magnitude of the other element of 
price  that  pays  labour  the  variable  part  of  capital  is  in  inverse  proportion  to  the  advance  of 
accumulation  
This diminution in the variable part of capital as compared with the constant or the altered value
composition of the capital however only shows approximately the change in the composition of 
its material constituents If eg the capitalvalue employed today in spinning is  constant and 
 variable whilst at the beginning of the th century it was  constant and  variable on the 
other  hand  the  mass  of  raw  material  instruments  of  labour  c  that  a  certain  quantity  of 
spinning  labour  consumes  productively  today  is  many  hundred  times  greater  than  at  the 
beginning  of  the  th  century  The  reason  is  simply  that  with  the  increasing  productivity  of 
labour  not  only  does  the mass  of  the  means  of  production  consumed  by  it  increase  but  their 
value  compared  with  their  mass  diminishes  Their  value  therefore  rises  absolutely  but  not  in 
proportion to their mass The increase of the difference between constant and variable capital is 
therefore much less than that of the difference between the mass of the means of production into 
which the constant and the mass of the labour power into which the variable capital is converted 
The former difference increases with the latter but in a smaller degree  
But if the progress of accumulation lessens the relative magnitude of the variable part of capital 
it by no means in doing this excludes the possibility of a rise in its absolute magnitude Suppose 
that a capitalvalue at first is divided into  per cent of constant and  per cent of variable 
capital later into  per cent of constant and  per cent of variable If in the meantime the 
original capital say  has increased to  its variable constituent has also increased 
It  was    it is  now    But  where  as  formerly  an increase  of  capital  by    per cent 
would have sufficed to raise the demand for labour  per cent now this latter rise requires a 
tripling of the original capital  
In Part IV it was shown how the development of the productiveness of social labour presupposes 
cooperation on a large scale how it is only upon this supposition that division and combination 
of labour can be organised and the means of production economised by concentration on a vast 
scale how instruments of labour which from their very nature are only fit for use in common 
such as a system of machinery can be called into being how huge natural forces can be pressed 
into  the  service  of  production  and  how  the  transformation  can  be  effected  of  the  process  of 
production  into  a  technological  application  of  science  On  the  basis  of  the  production  of 
commodities where the means of production are the property of private persons and where the 
artisan therefore either produces commodities isolated from and independent of others or sells 
his  labour  power  as  a  commodity  because  he  lacks  the  means  for  independent  industry  co
operation  on a  large  scale  can realise itself  only  in the increase  of  individual capitals  only  in 
proportion as the means of social production and the means of subsistence are transformed into 
the  private  property  of  capitalists  The  basis  of  the  production  of  commodities  can  admit  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
production on a large scale in the capitalistic form alone A certain accumulation of capital in the 
hands of individual producers of commodities forms therefore the necessary preliminary of the 
specifically capitalistic mode of production We had therefore to assume that this occurs during 
the transition from  handicraft  to  capitalistic  industry  It  may  be  called  primitive  accumulation 
because it is the historic basis instead of the historic result of specifically capitalist production 
How it itself originates we need not here inquire as yet It is enough that it forms the starting 
point But all methods for raising the social productive power of labour that are developed on this 
basis  are  at  the  same  time  methods  for  the  increased  production  of  surplusvalue  or  surplus
product which in its turn is the formative element of accumulation They are therefore at the 
same  time  methods  of  the  production  of  capital  by  capital  or  methods  of  its  accelerated 
accumulation The continual retransformation of surplusvalue into capital now appears in the 
shape of the increasing magnitude of the capital that enters into the process of production This in 
turn is the basis of an extended scale of production of the methods for raising the productive 
power of labour that accompany it and of accelerated production of surplusvalue If therefore a 
certain degree of accumulation of capital appears as a condition of the specifically capitalist mode 
of  production  the  latter  causes  conversely  an  accelerated  accumulation  of  capital  With  the 
accumulation of capital therefore the specifically capitalistic mode of production develops and 
with the capitalist mode of production the accumulation of capital Both these economic factors 
bring about in the compound ratio of the impulses they reciprocally give one another that change 
in the technical composition of capital by which the variable constituent becomes always smaller 
and smaller as compared with the constant  
Every  individual  capital  is  a  larger  or  smaller  concentration  of  means  of  production  with  a 
corresponding command over a larger or smaller labourarmy Every accumulation becomes the 
means  of  new  accumulation  With  the  increasing  mass  of  wealth  which  functions  as  capital 
accumulation increases the concentration of that wealth in the hands of individual capitalists and 
thereby widens the basis of production on a large scale and of the specific methods of capitalist 
production The growth of social capital is effected by the growth of many individual capitals All 
other circumstances remaining the same individual capitals and with them the concentration of 
the means of production increase in such proportion as they form aliquot parts of the total social 
capital At the same time portions of the original capitals disengage themselves and function as 
new  independent  capitals  Besides  other  causes  the  division  of  property  within  capitalist 
families  plays  a  great  part  in  this With  the  accumulation  of capital therefore  the  number  of 
capitalists grows to a greater or less extent Two points characterise this kind of concentration 
which  grows  directly  out  of  or  rather  is  identical  with  accumulation  First  The  increasing 
concentration  of  the  social  means  of  production  in  the  hands  of  individual  capitalists  is  other 
things remaining equal limited by the degree of increase of social wealth Second The part of 
social capital domiciled in each particular sphere of production is divided among many capitalists 
who  face  one  another  as  independent  commodityproducers  competing  with  each  other 
Accumulation and the concentration accompanying it are therefore not only scattered over many 
points but the increase of each functioning capital is thwarted by the formation of new and the 
subdivision of old capitals Accumulation therefore presents itself on the one hand as increasing 
concentration  of  the  means  of  production  and  of  the  command  over  labour  on  the  other  as 
repulsion of many individual capitals one from another  
This splittingup of the total social capital into many individual capitals or the repulsion of its 
fractions one from another is counteracted by their attraction This last does not mean that simple 
concentration  of the  means  of  production  and  of  the  command  over  labour  which is identical 
with accumulation It is concentration of capitals already formed destruction of their individual 

 

 

Chapter  
 
independence  expropriation  of  capitalist  by  capitalist  transformation  of  many  small  into  few 
large capitals This process differs from the former in this that it only presupposes a change in 
the  distribution  of  capital  already  to  hand  and  functioning  its  field  of  action  is  therefore  not 
limited by the absolute growth of social wealth by the absolute limits of accumulation Capital 
grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand because it has in another place been lost by 
many This is centralisation proper as distinct from accumulation and concentration  
The  laws  of  this  centralisation  of  capitals  or  of  the  attraction  of  capital  by  capital  cannot  be 
developed here A brief hint at a few facts must suffice The battle of competition is fought by 
cheapening  of  commodities  The  cheapness  of  commodities  demands  caeteris  paribus  on  the 
productiveness of labour and this again on the scale of production Therefore the larger capitals 
beat the smaller It will further be remembered that with the development of the capitalist mode 
of production there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry 
on a business under its normal conditions The smaller capitals therefore crowd into spheres of 
production  which  Modern  Industry  has  only  sporadically  or  incompletely  got  hold  of  Here 
competition rages in direct proportion to the number and in inverse proportion to the magnitudes 
of the antagonistic capitals It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists whose capitals 
partly  pass  into  the  hands  of  their  conquerors  partly  vanish  Apart  from  this  with  capitalist 
production an altogether new force comes into play  the credit system which in its first stages 
furtively creeps in as the humble assistant of accumulation drawing into the hands of individual 
or associated capitalists by invisible threads the money resources which lie scattered over the 
surface of society in larger or smaller amounts but it soon becomes a new and terrible weapon in 
the battle of competition and is finally transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the 
centralisation of capitals  
Commensurately with the development of capitalist production and accumulation there develop 
the two  most  powerful  levers  of  centralisation   competition  and  credit  At  the  same  time  the 
progress  of  accumulation  increases  the  material  amenable  to  centralisation  ie  the  individual 
capitals whilst the expansion of capitalist production creates on the one hand the social want 
and on the other the technical means necessary for those immense industrial undertakings which 
require a previous centralisation of capital for their accomplishment Today therefore the force 
of attraction drawing together individual capitals and the tendency to centralisation are stronger 
than ever before But if the relative extension and energy of the movement towards centralisation 
is  determined  in  a  certain  degree  by  the  magnitude  of  capitalist  wealth  and  superiority  of 
economic  mechanism  already  attained  progress  in  centralisation  does  not  in  any  way  depend 
upon  a  positive  growth  in  the  magnitude  of  social  capital  And  this  is  the  specific  difference 
between centralisation and concentration the latter being only another name for reproduction on 
an extended scale Centralisation may result from a mere change in the distribution of capitals 
already existing from a simple alteration in the quantitative grouping of the component parts of 
social capital Here capital can grow into powerful masses in a single hand because there it has 
been  withdrawn  from  many  individual  hands  In  any  given  branch  of  industry  centralisation 
would reach its extreme limit if all the individual capitals invested in it were fused into a single 
capital In a given society the limit would be reached only when the entire social capital was 
united in the hands of either a single capitalist or a single capitalist company  
Centralisation completes the work of accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the 
scale  of  their  operations  Whether  this  latter  result  is  the  consequence  of  accumulation  or 
centralisation  whether  centralisation  is  accomplished  by  the  violent  method  of  annexation   
when certain capitals become such preponderant centres of attraction for others that they shatter 
the  individual  cohesion  of  the  latter  and  then  draw  the  separate  fragments  to  themselves    or 

 

 

Chapter  
 
whether the fusion of a number of capitals already formed or in process of formation takes place 
by the smoother process of organising jointstock companies  the economic effect remains the 
same Everywhere the increased scale of industrial establishments is the starting point for a more 
comprehensive  organisation  of  the  collective  work  of  many  for  a  wider  development  of  their 
material motive forces  in other words for the progressive transformation of isolated processes 
of production carried on by customary methods into processes of production socially combined 
and scientifically arranged  
But accumulation the gradual increase of capital by reproduction as it passes from the circular to 
the spiral form is clearly a very slow procedure compared with centralisation which has only to 
change the quantitative groupings of the constituent parts of social capital The world would still 
be without railways if it had had to wait until accumulation had got a few individual capitals far 
enough  to  be  adequate  for  the  construction  of  a  railway  Centralisation  on  the  contrary 
accomplished  this  in  the  twinkling  of  an  eye  by  means  of  jointstock  companies  And  whilst 
centralisation  thus  intensifies  and  accelerates  the  effects  of  accumulation  it  simultaneously 
extends  and  speeds  those  revolutions  in  the  technical  composition  of  capital  which  raise  its 
constant portion at the expense of its variable portion thus diminishing the relative demand for 
labour  
The masses of capital fused together overnight by centralisation reproduce and multiply as the 
others do only more rapidly thereby becoming new and powerful levers in social accumulation 
Therefore when we speak of the progress of social accumulation we tacitly include  today  the 
effects of centralisation  
The additional capitals formed in the normal course of accumulation see Chapter XXIV Section 
  serve  particularly  as  vehicles  for  the  exploitation  of  new  inventions  and  discoveries  and 
industrial  improvements  in  general  But  in  time  the  old  capital  also  reaches  the  moment  of 
renewal  from  top  to  toe  when  it  sheds  its  skin  and  is  reborn  like  the  others  in  a  perfected 
technical form in which a smaller quantity of labour will suffice to set in motion a larger quantity 
of  machinery  and  raw  materials  The  absolute  reduction  in  the  demand  for  labour  which 
necessarily follows from this is obviously so much the greater the higher the degree in which the 
capitals  undergoing  this  process  of  renewal  are  already  massed  together  by  virtue  of  the 
centralisation movement  
On the one hand therefore the additional capital formed in the course of accumulation attracts 
fewer  and  fewer  labourers  in  proportion  to  its  magnitude  On  the  other  hand  the  old  capital 
periodically  reproduced  with  change  of  composition  repels  more  and  more  of  the  labourers 
formerly employed by it  

Section  Progressive Production of a Relative surplus 

population or Industrial Reserve Army 

The  accumulation  of  capital  though  originally  appearing  as  its  quantitative  extension  only  is 
effected  as  we  have  seen  under  a  progressive  qualitative  change  in  its  composition  under  a 
constant increase of its constant at the expense of its variable constituent  
The specifically capitalist mode of production the development of the productive power of labour 
corresponding to it and the change thence resulting in the organic composition of capital do not 
merely keep pace with the advance of accumulation or with the growth of social wealth They 
develop  at  a  much  quicker  rate  because  mere  accumulation the absolute  increase  of the total 
social capital is accompanied by the centralisation of the individual capitals of which that total is 
made up and because the change in the technological composition of the additional capital goes 
 

 

Chapter  
 
hand in hand with a similar change in the technological composition of the original capital With 
the advance of accumulation therefore the proportion of constant to variable capital changes If 
it was originally say  it now becomes successively      c so that as the 
capital increases instead of  of its total value only      c is transformed 
into labourpower and on the other hand      into means of production Since 
the demand for labour is determined not by the amount of capital as a whole but by its variable 
constituent alone that demand falls progressively with the increase of the total capital instead of 
as previously assumed rising in proportion to it It falls relatively to the magnitude of the total 
capital  and  at  an  accelerated  rate  as  this  magnitude  increases  With  the  growth  of  the  total 
capital  its  variable  constituent  or  the  labour  incorporated  in  it  also  does  increase  but  in  a 
constantly diminishing proportion The intermediate pauses are shortened in which accumulation 
works  as  simple  extension  of  production  on  a  given  technical  basis  It  is  not  merely  that  an 
accelerated  accumulation  of  total  capital  accelerated  in  a  constantly  growing  progression  is 
needed  to  absorb  an  additional  number  of  labourers  or  even  on  account  of  the  constant 
metamorphosis  of  old  capital  to  keep  employed  those  already  functioning  In  its  turn  this 
increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the composition 
of  capital  of  a  more  accelerated  diminution  of  its  variable  as  compared  with  its  constant 
constituent This accelerated relative diminution of the variable constituent that goes along with 
the accelerated increase of the total capital and moves more rapidly than this increase takes the 
inverse form at the other pole of an apparently absolute increase of the labouring population an 
increase  always  moving  more  rapidly  than  that  of  the  variable  capital  or  the  means  of 
employment  But  in  fact  it  is  capitalistic  accumulation  itself  that  constantly  produces  and 
produces in the  direct  ratio  of its  own  energy  and  extent  a relatively  redundant  population  of 
labourers  ie  a  population  of  greater  extent  than  suffices  for  the  average  needs  of  the  self
expansion of capital and therefore a surplus population  
Considering  the  social  capital  in  its  totality  the  movement  of  its  accumulation  now  causes 
periodical  changes  affecting  it  more  or  less  as  a  whole  now  distributes  its  various  phases 
simultaneously  over  the  different  spheres  of  production  In  some  spheres  a  change  in  the 
composition  of  capital occurs  without increase  of  its  absolute  magnitude  as  a consequence  of 
simple  centralisation  in  others  the  absolute  growth  of  capital  is  connected  with  absolute 
diminution  of  its  variable  constituent  or  of  the  labour  power  absorbed  by  it  in  others  again 
capital continues growing for a time on its given technical basis and attracts additional labour 
power in proportion to its increase while at other times it undergoes organic change and lessens 
its variable constituent in all spheres the increase of the variable part of capital and therefore of 
the  number  of  labourers  employed  by  it  is  always  connected  with  violent  fluctuations  and 
transitory  production  of  surplus  population  whether  this  takes  the  more  striking  form  of  the 
repulsion of labourers already employed or the less evident but not less real form of the more 
difficult absorption of the additional labouring population through the usual channels With the 
magnitude of social capital already functioning and the degree of its increase with the extension 
of the scale of production and the mass of the labourers set in motion with the development of 
the productiveness of their labour with the greater breadth and fulness of all sources of wealth 
there  is  also  an  extension  of  the  scale  on  which  greater  attraction  of  labourers  by  capital  is 
accompanied by their greater repulsion the rapidity of the change in the organic composition of 
capital and in its technical form increases and an increasing number of spheres of production 
becomes involved in this change now simultaneously now alternately The labouring population 
therefore produces along with the accumulation of capital produced by it the means by which it 
itself is made relatively superfluous is turned into a relative surplus population and it does this to 
an  always  increasing  extent  This  is  a  law  of  population  peculiar  to  the  capitalist  mode  of 
 

 

Chapter  
 
production  and  in  fact  every  special  historic  mode  of  production  has  its  own  special  laws  of 
population historically valid within its limits and only in so far as man has not interfered with 
them  
But  if  a  surplus  labouring  population  is  a  necessary  product  of  accumulation  or  of  the 
development  of  wealth  on  a  capitalist  basis  this  surplus  population  becomes  conversely  the 
lever  of  capitalistic  accumulation  nay  a  condition  of  existence  of  the  capitalist  mode  of 
production  It  forms  a  disposable  industrial  reserve  army  that  belongs  to  capital  quite  as 
absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost  Independently of the limits of the actual 
increase of population it creates for the changing needs of the selfexpansion of capital a mass 
of human material always ready for exploitation With accumulation and the development of the 
productiveness of labour that accompanies it the power of sudden expansion of capital grows 
also it grows not merely because the elasticity of the capital already functioning increases not 
merely because the absolute wealth of society expands of which capital only forms an elastic 
part not merely because credit under every special stimulus at once places an unusual part of 
this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital it grows also because 
the technical conditions of the process of production themselves  machinery means of transport 
c    now  admit  of  the  rapidest  transformation  of  masses  of  surplusproduct  into  additional 
means of production The mass of social wealth overflowing with the advance of accumulation 
and transformable into additional capital thrusts itself frantically into old branches of production 
whose market suddenly expands or into newly formed branches such as railways c the need 
for  which  grows  out  of  the  development  of  the  old  ones  In  all  such  cases  there  must  be  the 
possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points without injury to the 
scale  of  production  in  other  spheres  Overpopulation  supplies  these  masses  The  course 
characteristic of modern industry viz a decennial cycle interrupted by smaller oscillations of 
periods  of  average  activity  production  at  high  pressure  crisis  and  stagnation  depends  on  the 
constant formation the greater or less absorption and the reformation of the industrial reserve 
army or surplus population In their turn the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the 
surplus population and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction This peculiar 
course  of  modern  industry  which  occurs  in  no  earlier  period  of  human  history  was  also 
impossible in the childhood of capitalist production The composition of capital changed but very 
slowly With its accumulation therefore there kept pace on the whole a corresponding growth 
in the demand for labour Slow as was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more 
modern times it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable labouring population limits 
which could only be got rid of by forcible means to be mentioned later The expansion by fits and 
starts  of  the  scale  of  production is the  preliminary  to  its  equally  sudden contraction  the latter 
again evokes the former but the former is impossible without disposable human material without 
an increase in the number of labourers independently of the absolute growth of the population 
This increase is effected by the simple process that constantly sets free a part of the labourers 
by  methods  which  lessen  the  number  of  labourers  employed  in  proportion  to  the  increased 
production The whole form of the movement of modern industry depends therefore upon the 
constant transformation of a part of the labouring population into unemployed or halfemployed 
hands  The  superficiality  of  Political  Economy  shows  itself  in  the  fact  that  it  looks  upon  the 
expansion  and  contraction  of  credit  which  is  a  mere  symptom  of  the  periodic  changes  of  the 
industrial  cycle  as  their  cause  As  the  heavenly  bodies  once  thrown  into  a  certain  definite 
motion always repeat this so is it with social production as soon as it is once thrown into this 
movement of alternate expansion and contraction Effects in their turn become causes and the 
varying accidents of the whole process which always reproduces its own conditions take on the 
form of periodicity When this periodicity is once consolidated even Political Economy then sees 
 

Chapter  
 
that the production of a relative surplus population  ie surplus with regard to the average needs 
of the selfexpansion of capital  is a necessary condition of modern industry  

 

Suppose says H Merivale formerly Professor of Political Economy at Oxford 
subsequently employed in the English Colonial Office suppose that on the 
occasion of some of these crises the nation were to rouse itself to the effort of 
getting rid by emigration of some hundreds of thousands of superfluous arms 
what would be the consequence That at the first returning demand for labour 
there would be a deficiency However rapid reproduction may be it takes at all 
events the space of a generation to replace the loss of adult labour Now the 
profits of our manufacturers depend mainly on the power of making use of the 
prosperous moment when demand is brisk and thus compensating themselves for 
the interval during which it is slack This power is secured to them only by the 
command of machinery and of manual labour They must have hands ready by 
them they must be able to increase the activity of their operations when required 
and to slacken it again according to the state of the market or they cannot 
possibly maintain that preeminence in the race of competition on which the 
wealth of the country is founded  

Even  Malthus  recognises  overpopulation  as  a  necessity  of  modern  industry  though  after  his 
narrow fashion he explains it by the absolute overgrowth of the labouring population not by 
their becoming relatively supernumerary He says 

Prudential habits with regard to marriage carried to a considerable extent among 
the labouring class of a country mainly depending upon manufactures and 
commerce might injure it From the nature of a population an increase of 
labourers cannot be brought into market in consequence of a particular demand till 
after the lapse of  or  years and the conversion of revenue into capital by 
saving may take place much more rapidly a country is always liable to an 
increase in the quantity of the funds for the maintenance of labour faster than the 
increase of population  

After  Political  Economy  has  thus  demonstrated  the  constant  production  of  a  relative  surplus 
population of labourers to be a necessity of capitalistic accumulation she very aptly in the guise 
of an old maid puts in the mouth of her beau ideal of a capitalist the following words addressed 
to those supernumeraries thrown on the streets by their own creation of additional capital  

We manufacturers do what we can for you whilst we are increasing that capital 
on which you must subsist and you must do the rest by accommodating your 
numbers to the means of subsistence  

Capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour power 
which the natural increase of population yields It requires for its free play an industrial reserve 
army independent of these natural limits  
Up  to  this  point  it  has  been  assumed  that  the  increase  or  diminution  of  the  variable  capital 
corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed  
The number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same or even fall while the 
variable  capital  increases  This  is  the  case  if  the  individual  labourer  yields  more  labour  and 
therefore his wages increase and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls 
only more slowly than the mass of labour rises Increase of variable capital in this case becomes 
an index of more labour but not of more labourers employed It is the absolute interest of every 
capitalist  to  press  a  given quantity  of labour out  of  a  smaller rather  than  a  greater  number  of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
labourers if the cost is about the same In the latter case the outlay of constant capital increases 
in proportion to the mass of labour set in action in the former that increase is much smaller The 
more  extended  the  scale  of  production  the  stronger  this  motive  Its  force  increases  with  the 
accumulation of capital  
We have seen that the development of the capitalist mode of production and of the productive 
power of labour  at once the cause and effect of accumulation  enables the capitalist with the 
same outlay of variable capital to set in action more labour by greater exploitation extensive or 
intensive of each individual labour power We have further seen that the capitalist buys with the 
same capital a greater mass of labour power as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less 
skilled  mature  labour  power  by  immature  male  by  female  that  of  adults  by  that  of  young 
persons or children  
On the one hand therefore with the progress of accumulation a larger variable capital sets more 
labour  in  action  without  enlisting  more  labourers  on  the  other  a  variable  capital  of  the  same 
magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour power and finally a greater 
number of inferior labour powers by displacement of higher  
The production of a relative surplus population or the setting free of labourers goes on therefore 
yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies and 
is  accelerated  by  the  advance  of  accumulation  and  more  rapidly  than  the  corresponding 
diminution  of  the  variable  part  of  capital  as  compared  with  the  constant  If  the  means  of 
production  as  they  increase  in  extent  and  effective  power  become  to  a  less  extent  means  of 
employment of labourers this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as 
the productiveness of labour increases capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its 
demand for labourers The overwork of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks 
of the reserve whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on 
the former forces these to submit to overwork and to subjugation under the dictates of capital 
The condemnation of one part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of the 
other  part  and  the  converse  becomes  a  means  of  enriching  the  individual  capitalists  and 
accelerates  at  the  same  time  the  production  of  the  industrial  reserve  army  on  a  scale 
corresponding  with  the  advance  of  social  accumulation  How  important  is  this  element  in  the 
formation of the relative surplus population is shown by the example of England Her technical 
means for saving labour are colossal Nevertheless if tomorrow morning labour generally were 
reduced  to  a  rational  amount  and  proportioned  to  the  different  sections  of  the  working  class 
according to age and sex the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the 
carrying on of national production on its present scale The great majority of the labourers now 
unproductive would have to be turned into productive ones  
Taking  them  as  a  whole  the  general  movements  of  wages  are  exclusively  regulated  by  the 
expansion  and  contraction  of  the  industrial  reserve  army  and  these  again  correspond  to  the 
periodic changes of the industrial cycle They are therefore not determined by the variations of 
the  absolute  number  of  the  working  population  but  by  the  varying  proportions  in  which  the 
working class is divided into active and reserve army by the increase or diminution in the relative 
amount of the surplus population by the extent to which it is now absorbed now set free For 
Modern Industry with its decennial cycles and periodic phases which moreover as accumulation 
advances are complicated by irregular oscillations following each other more and more quickly 
that would indeed be a beautiful law which pretends to make the action of capital dependent on 
the absolute variation of the population instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by 
the  alternate  expansion  and  contraction  of  capital  the  labourmarket  now  appearing  relatively 
underfull because capital is expanding now again overfull because it is contracting Yet this is 

 

 

Chapter  
 
the dogma of the economists According to them wages rise in consequence of accumulation of 
capital The higher wages stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication and this 
goes on until the labourmarket becomes too full and therefore capital relatively to the supply of 
labour becomes insufficient Wages fall and now we have the reverse of the medal The working 
population is little by little decimated as the result of the fall in wages so that capital is again in 
excess relatively to them or as others explain it falling wages and the corresponding increase in 
the  exploitation  of  the  labourer  again  accelerates  accumulation  whilst  at  the  same  time  the 
lower wages hold the increase of the working class in check Then comes again the time when 
the supply of labour is less than the demand wages rise and so on A beautiful mode of motion 
this for developed capitalist production Before in consequence of the rise of wages any positive 
increase of the population really fit for work could occur the time would have been passed again 
and again during which the industrial campaign must have been carried through the battle fought 
and won  
Between  and  a rise of wages practically insignificant though accompanied by falling 
prices of corn took place in the English agricultural districts In Wiltshire eg the weekly wages 
rose from s to s in Dorsetshire from s or s to s c This was the result of an unusual 
exodus of the agricultural surplus population caused by the demands of war the vast extension of 
railroads factories mines c The lower the wages the higher is the proportion in which ever so 
insignificant a rise of them expresses itself If the weekly wage eg is s and it rises to s 
that is a rise of  per cent but if it is only s and it rises to s that is a rise of   per cent 
which sounds very fine Everywhere the farmers were howling and the London Economist with 
reference  to  these  starvationwages  prattled  quite  seriously  of  a  general  and  substantial 
advance What did the farmers do now Did they wait until in consequence of this brilliant 
remuneration the agricultural labourers had so increased and multiplied that their wages must fall 
again as prescribed by the dogmatic economic brain They introduced more machinery and in a 
moment  the  labourers  were  redundant  again  in  a  proportion  satisfactory  even  to  the  farmers 
There was now more capital laid out in agriculture than before and in a more productive form 
With this the demand for labour fell not only relatively but absolutely  
The above economic fiction confuses the laws that regulate the general movement of wages or 
the ratio between the working class  ie the total labour power  and the total social capital 
with the laws that distribute the working population over the different spheres of production If 
eg  in  consequence  of  favourable  circumstances  accumulation  in  a  particular  sphere  of 
production  becomes  especially  active  and  profits  in  it  being  greater  than  the  average  profits 
attract additional capital of course the demand for labour rises and wages also rise The higher 
wages  draw  a  larger  part  of  the  working  population  into  the  more  favoured  sphere  until  it  is 
glutted with labour power and wages at length fall again to their average level or below it if the 
pressure is too great Then not only does the immigration of labourers into the branch of industry 
in question cease it gives place to their emigration Here the political economist thinks he sees 
the why and wherefore of an absolute increase of workers accompanying an increase of wages 
and of a diminution of wages accompanying an absolute increase of labourers But he sees really 
only the local oscillation of the labourmarket in a particular sphere of production  he sees only 
the  phenomena  accompanying  the  distribution  of  the  working  population  into  the  different 
spheres of outlay of capital according to its varying needs  
The  industrial  reserve  army  during  the  periods  of  stagnation  and  average  prosperity  weighs 
down the active labourarmy during the periods of overproduction and paroxysm it holds its 
pretensions in check Relative surplus population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
demand and supply of labour works It confines the field of action of this law within the limits 
absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital  
This  is  the  place  to  return  to  one  of  the  grand  exploits  of  economic  apologetics  It  will  be 
remembered that if through the introduction of new or the extension of old machinery a portion 
of variable capital is transformed into constant the economic apologist interprets this operation 
which  fixes  capital  and  by  that  very  act  sets  labourers  free  in  exactly  the  opposite  way 
pretending  that  it  sets  free  capital  for  the  labourers  Only  now  can  one  fully  understand  the 
effrontery of these apologists What are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out 
by  the  machines  but  also  their  future  substitutes  in  the  rising  generation  and  the  additional 
contingent that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed 
They are now all set free and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose 
of them Whether it attracts them or others the effect on the general labour demand will be nil if 
this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw 
upon it If it employs a smaller number that of the supernumeraries increases if it employs a 
greater the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed 
over those set free The impulse that additional capital seeking an outlet would otherwise have 
given to the general demand for labour is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the 
labourers thrown out of employment by the machine That is to say the mechanism of capitalistic 
production  so  manages  matters  that  the  absolute  increase  of  capital  is  accompanied  by  no 
corresponding rise in the general demand for labour And this the apologist calls a compensation 
for the misery the sufferings the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition 
period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army The demand for labour is not identical 
with increase of capital nor supply of labour with increase of the working class It is not a case of 
two independent forces working on one another Les ds sont pips 
Capital works on both sides at the same time If its accumulation on the one hand increases the 
demand for labour it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the setting free of them 
whilst  at  the  same  time  the  pressure  of  the  unemployed  compels  those  that  are  employed  to 
furnish more labour and therefore makes the supply of labour to a certain extent independent of 
the  supply  of  labourers  The  action  of  the  law  of  supply  and  demand  of  labour  on  this  basis 
completes the despotism of capital As soon therefore as the labourers learn the secret how it 
comes  to  pass  that  in  the  same  measure  as  they  work  more  as  they  produce  more  wealth  for 
others and as the productive power of their labour increases so in the same measure even their 
function as a means of the selfexpansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them 
as  soon  as  they  discover  that  the  degree  of  intensity  of  the  competition  among  themselves 
depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus population as soon as by Trades Unions 
c they try to organise a regular cooperation between employed and unemployed in order to 
destroy  or  to  weaken  the  ruinous  effects  of  this  natural  law  of  capitalistic  production  on  their 
class so soon  capital  and its  sycophant  Political  Economy  cry  out  at the  infringement  of the 
eternal and so to say sacred law of supply and demand Every combination of employed and 
unemployed disturbs the harmonious action of this law But on the other hand as soon as in 
the colonies eg adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and 
with it the absolute dependence of the working class upon the capitalist class capital along with 
its commonplace Sancho Panza rebels against the sacred law of supply and demand and tries 
to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference 

 

 
Chapter  
Section  Different Forms of the Relative surplus population 

 

The General Law of Capitalistic Accumulation 

The relative surplus population exists in every possible form Every labourer belongs to it during 
the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed Not taking into account the 
great periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle impress on it 
now an acute form during the crisis then again a chronic form during dull times  it has always 
three forms the floating the latent the stagnant  
In the centres of modern industry  factories manufactures ironworks mines c  the labourers 
are  sometimes  repelled  sometimes  attracted  again  in  greater  masses  the  number  of  those 
employed increasing on the whole although in a constantly decreasing proportion to the scale of 
production Here the surplus population exists in the floating form  
In the automatic factories as in all the great workshops where machinery enters as a factor or 
where only the modern division of labour is carried out large numbers of boys are employed up 
to the age of maturity When this term is once reached only a very small number continue to find 
employment in the same branches of industry whilst the majority are regularly discharged This 
majority forms an element of the floating surplus population growing with the extension of those 
branches of industry Part of them emigrates following in fact capital that has emigrated One 
consequence is that the female population grows more rapidly than the male teste England That 
the  natural  increase  of  the  number  of  labourers  does  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the 
accumulation of capital and yet all the time is in excess of them is a contradiction inherent to the 
movement of capital itself It wants larger numbers of youthful labourers a smaller number of 
adults The contradiction is not more glaring than that other one that there is a complaint of the 
want of hands while at the same time many thousands are out of work because the division of 
labour chains them to a particular branch of industry  
The  consumption  of  labour  power  by  capital  is  besides  so  rapid  that  the  labourer  halfway 
through his life has already more or less completely lived himself out He falls into the ranks of 
the supernumeraries or is thrust down from a higher to a lower step in the scale It is precisely 
among the workpeople of modern industry that we meet with the shortest duration of life Dr 
Lee Medical Officer of Health for Manchester stated 

that the average age at death of the Manchester  upper middle class was  
years while the average age at death of the labouring class was  while at 
Liverpool those figures were represented as  against  It thus appeared that 
the welltodo classes had a lease of life which was more than double the value of 
that which fell to the lot of the less favoured citizens  

In order to conform to these circumstances the absolute increase of this section of the proletariat 
must take place under conditions that shall swell their numbers although the individual elements 
are used up rapidly Hence rapid renewal of the generations of labourers this law does not hold 
for the other classes of the population This social need is met by early marriages a necessary 
consequence  of  the  conditions  in  which  the  labourers  of  modern  industry  live  and  by  the 
premium that the exploitation of children sets on their production  
As soon as capitalist production takes possession of agriculture and in proportion to the extent to 
which it does so the demand for an agricultural labouring population falls absolutely while the 
accumulation of the capital employed in agriculture advances without this repulsion being as in 
nonagricultural  industries  compensated  by  a  greater  attraction  Part  of  the  agricultural 
population is therefore constantly on the point of passing over into an urban or manufacturing 

 

 

Chapter  
 
proletariat and on the lookout for circumstances favourable to this transformation Manufacture 
is  used  here  in  the  sense  of  all  nonagricultural  industries  This  source  of  relative  surplus 
population is thus constantly flowing But the constant flow towards the towns presupposes in 
the country itself a constant latent surplus population the extent of which becomes evident only 
when  its  channels  of  outlet  open  to  exceptional  width  The  agricultural  labourer  is  therefore 
reduced  to  the  minimum  of  wages  and  always  stands  with  one  foot  already  in  the  swamp  of 
pauperism  
The  third  category  of  the  relative  surplus  population  the  stagnant  forms  a  part  of  the  active 
labour  army  but  with  extremely  irregular  employment  Hence  it  furnishes  to  capital  an 
inexhaustible reservoir of disposable labour power Its conditions of life sink below the average 
normal level of the working class this makes it at once the broad basis of special branches of 
capitalist exploitation It is characterised by maximum of workingtime and minimum of wages 
We have learnt to know its chief form under the rubric of domestic industry It recruits itself 
constantly from the supernumerary forces of modern industry and agriculture and specially from 
those decaying branches of industry where handicraft is yielding to manufacture manufacture to 
machinery  Its  extent  grows  as  with  the  extent  and  energy  of  accumulation  the  creation  of  a 
surplus  population  advances  But  it  forms  at  the  same  time  a  selfreproducing  and  self
perpetuating  element  of  the  working  class  taking  a  proportionally  greater  part  in  the  general 
increase of that class than the other elements In fact not only the number of births and deaths 
but  the  absolute  size  of  the  families  stand  in  inverse  proportion  to  the  height  of  wages  and 
therefore to the amount of means of subsistence of which the different categories of labourers 
dispose  This  law  of  capitalistic  society  would  sound  absurd  to  savages  or  even  civilised 
colonists It calls to mind the boundless reproduction of animals individually weak and constantly 
hunted down  
The lowest sediment of the relative surplus population finally dwells in the sphere of pauperism 
Exclusive of vagabonds criminals prostitutes in a word the dangerous classes this layer of 
society consists of three categories First those able to work One need only glance superficially 
at the statistics  of  English  pauperism  to  find that the  quantity  of paupers  increases  with every 
crisis and diminishes with every revival of trade Second orphans and pauper children These are 
candidates  for  the  industrial  reserve  army  and  are  in  times  of  great  prosperity  as    eg 
speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of labourers Third the demoralised 
and  ragged  and  those  unable  to  work  chiefly  people  who  succumb  to  their  incapacity  for 
adaptation due to the division of labour people who have passed the normal age of the labourer 
the victims of industry whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery of 
mines chemical works c the mutilated the sickly the widows c Pauperism is the hospital 
of the active labourarmy and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army Its production is 
included in that of the relative surplus population its necessity in theirs along with the surplus 
population  pauperism  forms  a  condition  of  capitalist  production  and  of  the  capitalist 
development of wealth It  enters into the faux frais of capitalist production but capital knows 
how to throw these for the most part from its own shoulders on to those of the working class and 
the lower middle class  
The greater the social wealth the functioning capital the extent and energy of its growth and 
therefore also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour the greater 
is the industrial reserve army The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital 
develop also the labour power at its disposal The relative mass of the industrial reserve army 
increases  therefore  with  the  potential  energy  of  wealth  But  the  greater  this  reserve  army  in 
proportion to the active labour army the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population 

 

 

Chapter  
 
whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour The more extensive finally the lazarus 
layers of the working class and the industrial reserve army the greater is official pauperism This 
is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation Like all other laws it is modified in its 
working by many circumstances the analysis of which does not concern us here  
The  folly  is  now  patent  of  the  economic  wisdom  that  preaches  to  the  labourers  the 
accommodation  of  their  number  to  the  requirements  of  capital  The  mechanism  of  capitalist 
production and accumulation constantly effects this adjustment The first word of this adaptation 
is  the  creation  of  a  relative  surplus  population  or  industrial  reserve  army  Its  last  word is  the 
misery  of  constantly  extending  strata  of  the  active  army  of  labour  and  the  dead  weight  of 
pauperism  
The law by which a constantly increasing quantity of means of production thanks to the advance 
in the productiveness of social labour may be set in movement by a progressively diminishing 
expenditure  of  human  power  this  law  in  a  capitalist  society    where  the  labourer  does  not 
employ the means of production but the means of production employ the labourer  undergoes a 
complete inversion and is expressed thus the higher the productiveness of labour the greater is 
the  pressure  of  the  labourers  on  the  means  of  employment  the  more  precarious  therefore 
becomes their condition of existence viz the sale of their own labour power for the increasing of 
anothers wealth or for the selfexpansion of capital The fact that the means of production and 
the  productiveness  of  labour  increase  more  rapidly  than  the  productive  population  expresses 
itself therefore capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always increases 
more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this increase for its own self
expansion  
We saw in Part IV when analysing the production of relative surplusvalue within the capitalist 
system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of 
the individual labourer all means for the development of production transform themselves into 
means of domination over and exploitation of the producers they mutilate the labourer into a 
fragment of a man degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine destroy every remnant 
of  charm  in  his  work  and  turn  it  into  a  hated  toil  they  estrange  from  him  the  intellectual 
potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an 
independent  power  they  distort  the  conditions  under  which  he  works  subject  him  during  the 
labour process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness they transform his lifetime into 
workingtime and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital But all 
methods for the production of surplusvalue are at the same time methods of accumulation and 
every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods It 
follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates the lot of the labourer be his payment 
high  or  low  must  grow  worse  The  law  finally  that  always  equilibrates  the  relative  surplus 
population or industrial reserve army to the extent and energy of accumulation this law rivets 
the  labourer  to  capital  more  firmly  than  the  wedges  of  Vulcan  did  Prometheus  to  the  rock  It 
establishes an accumulation of misery corresponding with accumulation of capital Accumulation 
of wealth at one pole is therefore at the same time accumulation of misery agony of toil slavery 
ignorance brutality mental degradation at the opposite pole ie on the side of the class that 
produces  its  own  product  in  the  form  of  capital  This  antagonistic  character  of  capitalistic 
accumulation  is  enunciated  in  various  forms  by  political  economists  although  by  them  it  is 
confounded  with  phenomena  certainly  to  some  extent  analogous  but  nevertheless  essentially 
distinct and belonging to precapitalistic modes of production  
The  Venetian  monk  Ortes  one  of  the  great  economic  writers  of  the  th  century  regards  the 
antagonism of capitalist production as a general natural law of social wealth 

 

 

 

Chapter  

In the economy of a nation advantages and evils always balance one another il 
bene ed il male economico in una nazione sempre all istessa misura the 
abundance of wealth with some people is always equal to the want of it with 
others la copia dei beni in alcuni sempre eguale alia mancanza di essi in altri the 
great riches of a small number are always accompanied by the absolute privation 
of the first necessaries of life for many others The wealth of a nation corresponds 
with its population and its misery corresponds with its wealth Diligence in some 
compels idleness in others The poor and idle are a necessary consequence of the 
rich and active c  

In a thoroughly brutal way about  years after Ortes the Church of England parson Townsend 
glorified misery as a necessary condition of wealth 

Legal constraint to labour is attended with too much trouble violence and 
noise whereas hunger is not only a peaceable silent unremitted pressure but as 
the most natural motive to industry and labour it calls forth the most powerful 
exertions  

Everything therefore depends upon making hunger permanent among the working class and for 
this  according  to  Townsend  the  principle  of  population  especially  active  among  the  poor 
provides 

It seems to be a law of Nature that the poor should be to a certain degree 
improvident ie so improvident as to be born without a silver spoon in the 
mouth that there may always be some to fulfil the most servile the most sordid 
and the most ignoble offices in the community The stock of human happiness is 
thereby much increased whilst the more delicate are not only relieved from 
drudgery  but are left at liberty without interruption to pursue those callings 
which are suited to their various dispositions  it the Poor Law tends to 
destroy the harmony and beauty the symmetry and order of that system which 
God and Nature have established in the world If the Venetian monk found in 
the fatal destiny that makes misery eternal the raison dtre of Christian charity 
celibacy monasteries and holy houses the Protestant prebendary finds in it a 
pretext for condemning the laws in virtue of which the poor possessed a right to a 
miserable public relief  
The progress of social wealth says Storch begets this useful class of society  
which performs the most wearisome the vilest the most disgusting functions 
which takes in a word on its shoulders all that is disagreeable and servile in life 
and procures thus for other classes leisure serenity of mind and conventional 
cest bon dignity of character  

Storch asks himself in what then really consists the progress of this capitalistic civilisation with 
its  misery  and  its  degradation  of  the  masses  as  compared  with  barbarism  He  finds  but  one 
answer security  

Thanks to the advance of industry and science says Sismondi every labourer 
can produce every day much more than his consumption requires But at the same 
time whilst his labour produces wealth that wealth would were he called on to 
consume it himself make him less fit for labour According to him men ie 
nonworkers would probably prefer to do without all artistic perfection and all 
the enjoyments that manufacturers procure for us if it were necessary that all 
should buy them by constant toil like that of the labourer Exertion today is

separated from its recompense it is not the same man that first works and then

Accumulation 

A England from  

No  period  of  modern  society  is  so  favourable  for  the  study  of  capitalist  accumulation  as  the 
period of the last  years It is as if this period had found Fortunatus purse But of all countries 
England again furnishes the classical example because it holds the foremost place in the world
market because capitalist production is here alone completely developed and lastly because the 
introduction  of  the  Freetrade  millennium  since    has  cut  off  the  last  retreat  of  vulgar 
economy  The titanic  advance  of  production   the  latter  half  of the    years period again far 
surpassing the former  has been already pointed out sufficiently in Part IV  
Although the absolute increase of the English population in the last half century was very great 
the relative increase or rate of growth fell constantly as the following table borrowed from the 
census shows

Let us now on the other hand consider the increase of wealth Here the movement of profit rent

liable to income tax farmers and some other categories not included in Great Britain from  
to  amounted to  or  as the annual average that of the population during the

number of farms of less than  acres had fallen from  to  so that  had been

After  these  few  examples  one  understands  the  cry  of  triumph  of  the  RegistrarGeneral  of  the 
British people 

Rapidly as the population has increased it has not kept pace with the progress of 
industry and wealth  

Let  us  turn  now  to  the  direct  agents  of  this  industry  or  the  producers  of  this  wealth  to  the 
working class 

It is one of the most melancholy features in the social state of this country says 
Gladstone that while there was a decrease in the consuming powers of the 
people and while there was an increase in the privations and distress of the 
labouring class and operatives there was at the same time a constant accumulation 
of wealth in the upper classes and a constant increase of capital  

Thus spake this unctuous minister in the House of Commons of February th  On April 
th   years later in the speech in which he introduced his Budget 

From  to  the taxable income of the country increased by  per cent 
In the  years from  to  it had increased from the basis taken in  by 
 per cent The fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible  this 
intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power  entirely confined to classes of 
property  must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population because it 
cheapens the commodities of general consumption While the rich have been 
growing richer the poor have been growing less poor At any rate whether the 
extremes of poverty are less I do not presume to say  

How  lame  an  anticlimax  If  the  working  class  has  remained  poor  only  less  poor  in 
proportion  as  it  produces  for  the  wealthy  class  an  intoxicating  augmentation  of  wealth  and 
power then it has remained relatively just as poor If the extremes of poverty have not lessened 
they have increased because the extremes of wealth have As to the cheapening of the means of 
subsistence  the  official  statistics  eg  the  accounts  of  the  London  Orphan  Asylum  show  an 
increase in price of  for the average of the three years  compared with  
In the following three years  there was a progressive rise in the price of meat butter 
milk  sugar  salt  coals  and  a  number  of  other  necessary  means  of subsistence    Gladstones 
next  Budget  speech  of  April  th    is  a  Pindaric  dithyrambus  on  the  advance  of  surplus
valuemaking and the happiness of the people tempered by poverty He speaks of masses on 
the border of pauperism of branches of trade in which wages have not increased and finally 
sums up the happiness of the working class in the words 

human life is but in nine cases out of ten a struggle for existence  

Professor Fawcett not bound like Gladstone by official considerations declares roundly 
I do not of course deny that money wages have been augmented by this increase 
of capital in the last ten years but this apparent advantage is to a great extent 
lost because many of the necessaries of life are becoming dearer he believes 
because of the fall in value of the precious metalsthe rich grow rapidly richer 
whilst there is no perceptible advance in the comfort enjoyed by the industrial 
classes They the labourers become almost the slaves of the tradesman to 
whom they owe money  

In  the  chapters  on  the  working  day  and  machinery  the  reader  has  seen  under  what 
circumstances  the  British  working  class  created  an  intoxicating  augmentation  of  wealth  and

power for the propertied classes There we were chiefly concerned with the social functioning of 
the  labourer  But  for  a  full  elucidation  of  the  law  of  accumulation  his  condition  outside  the 
workshop must also be looked at his condition as to food and dwelling The limits of this book 
compel us to concern ourselves chiefly with the worst paid part of the industrial proletariat and 
with the agricultural labourers who together form the majority of the working class  
But first one word on official pauperism or on that part of the working class which has forfeited 
its condition of existence the sale of labour power and vegetates upon public alms The official 
list of paupers numbered in England  persons in   in   In 
consequence of the cotton famine it grew in the years  and  to  and  
The crisis of  which fell most heavily on London created in this centre of the world market 
more  populous  than  the  kingdom  of  Scotland  an  increase  of  pauperism  for  the  year    of 
 compared with  and of  compared with  and a still greater increase for the 
first months of  as compared with  From the analysis of the statistics of pauperism two 
points are to be taken On the one hand the fluctuation up and down of the number of paupers 
reflects the periodic changes of the industrial cycle On the other the official statistics become 
more  and  more  misleading  as  to  the  actual  extent  of  pauperism  in  proportion  as  with  the 
accumulation of capital the classstruggle and therefore the class consciousness of the working 
men develop Eg the barbarity in the treatment of the paupers at which the English Press The 
Times Pall Mall Gazette etc have cried out so loudly during the last two years is of ancient 
date  F  Engels  showed  in    exactly  the  same  horrors  exactly  the  same  transient  canting 
outcries  of  sensational  literature  But  frightful  increase  of  deaths  by  starvation  in  London 
during the last ten years proves beyond doubt the growing horror in which the workingpeople 
hold the slavery of the workhouse that place of punishment for misery  

B The Badly Paid Strata of the British Industrial Class 

During the cotton famine of  Dr Smith was charged by the Privy Council with an inquiry 
into the conditions of nourishment of the distressed operatives in Lancashire and Cheshire His 
observations during many preceding years had led him to the conclusion that to avert starvation 
diseases the daily food of an average woman ought to contain at least  grains of carbon 
with  grains of nitrogen the daily food of an average man at least  grains of carbon with 
 grains of nitrogen for women about the same quantity of nutritive elements as are contained 
in    lbs  of  good  wheaten  bread  for  men    more  for the  weekly  average  of  adult  men  and 
women  at  least    grains  of  carbon  and    grains  of  nitrogen  His  calculation  was 
practically  confirmed  in  a  surprising  manner  by  its  agreement  with  the  miserable  quantity  of 
nourishment to which want had forced down the consumption of the cotton operatives This was 
in December   grains of carbon and  grains of nitrogen weekly  
In  the  year    the  Privy  Council  ordered  an  inquiry  into  the  state  of  distress  of  the  worst
nourished  part  of  the  English  working  class  Dr  Simon  medical  officer  to  the  Privy  Council 
chose for this work the abovementioned Dr Smith His inquiry ranges on the one hand over the 
agricultural  labourers  on  the  other  over  silkweavers  needlewomen  kidglovers  stocking
weavers  gloveweavers  and  shoemakers  The  latter  categories  are  with  the  exception  of  the 
stockingweavers exclusively towndwellers It was made a rule in the inquiry to select in each 
category the most healthy families and those comparatively in the best circumstances  
As a general result it was found that 

in only one of the examined classes of indoor operatives did the average 
nitrogen supply just exceed while in another it nearly reached the estimated 
standard of bare sufficiency ie sufficient to avert starvation diseases and that 

 

 

 

Chapter  

in two classes there was defect  in one a very large defect  of both nitrogen and 
carbon Moreover as regards the examined families of the agricultural population 
it appeared that more than a fifth were with less than the estimated sufficiency of 
carbonaceous food that more than onethird were with less than the estimated 
sufficiency of nitrogenous food and that in three counties Berkshire 
Oxfordshire and Somersetshire insufficiency of nitrogenous food was the 
average local diet  

Among the agricultural labourers those of England the wealthiest part of the United Kingdom 
were the worst fed The insufficiency of food among the agricultural labourers fell as a rule 
chiefly on the women and children for the man must eat to do his work Still greater penury 
ravaged the townworkers examined 

They are so ill fed that assuredly among them there must be many cases of severe 
and injurious privation  

Privation of the capitalist all this ie abstinence from paying for the means of subsistence 
absolutely necessary for the mere vegetation of his hands  
The following table shows the conditions of nourishment of the abovenamed categories of purely 
towndwelling workpeople as compared with the minimum assumed by Dr Smith and with the 
foodallowance of the cotton operatives during the time of their greatest distress

One half or  of the industrial labour categories investigated had absolutely no beer  
no  milk  The  weekly  average  of  the  liquid  means  of  nourishment  in  the  families  varied  from 
seven ounces in the needlewomen to  ounces in the stockingmakers The majority of those 
who did not obtain milk were needlewomen in London The quantity of breadstuffs consumed 
weekly varied from  lbs for the needlewomen to  lbs for the shoemakers and gave a 
total average of  lbs per adult weekly Sugar treacle etc varied from  ounces weekly for 
the  kidglovers  to    ounces  for  the  stockingmakers  and  the  total  average  per  week  for  all 
categories was  ounces per adult weekly Total weekly average of butter fat etc  ounces per 
adult The weekly average of meat bacon etc varied from  ounces for the silkweavers to 
 ounces for the kidglovers total average for the different categories  ounces The weekly 
cost of food per adult gave the following average figures silkweavers s d needlewomen 
s  d  kidglovers  s  d  shoemakers  s  d  stockingweavers  s  d  For  the  silk
weavers of Macclesfield the average was only s d The worst categories were the needle
women silkweavers and kidglovers Of these facts Dr Simon in his General Health Report 
says 

That cases are innumerable in which defective diet is the cause or the aggravator 
of disease can be affirmed by any one who is conversant with poor law medical 

 

 

 

Chapter  

practice or with the wards and outpatient rooms of hospitals Yet in this point 
of view there is in my opinion a very important sanitary context to be added It 
must be remembered that privation of food is very reluctantly borne and that as a 
rule great poorness of diet will only come when other privations have preceded it 
Long before insufficiency of diet is a matter of hygienic concern long before the 
physiologist would think of counting the grains of nitrogen and carbon which 
intervene between life and starvation the household will have been utterly 
destitute of material comfort clothing and fuel will have been even scantier than 
food  against inclemencies of weather there will have been no adequate 
protection  dwelling space will have been stinted to the degree in which 
overcrowding produces or increases disease of household utensils and furniture 
there will have been scarcely any  even cleanliness will have been found costly 
or difficult and if there still be selfrespectful endeavours to maintain it every 
such endeavour will represent additional pangs of hunger The home too will be 
where shelter can be cheapest bought in quarters where commonly there is least 
fruit of sanitary supervision least drainage least scavenging least suppression of 
public nuisances least or worst water supply and if in town least light and air 
Such are the sanitary dangers to which poverty is almost certainly exposed when 
it is poverty enough to imply scantiness of food And while the sum of them is of 
terrible magnitude against life the mere scantiness of food is in itself of very 
serious moment These are painful reflections especially when it is remembered 
that the poverty to which they advert is not the deserved poverty of idleness In all 
cases it is the poverty of working populations Indeed as regards the indoor 
operatives the work which obtains the scanty pittance of food is for the most part 
excessively prolonged Yet evidently it is only in a qualified sense that the work 
can be deemed selfsupporting And on a very large scale the nominal self
support can be only a circuit longer or shorter to pauperism  

The  intimate  connexion  between  the  pangs  of  hunger  of  the  most  industrious  layers  of  the 
working  class  and  the  extravagant  consumption  coarse  or  refined  of  the  rich  for  which 
capitalist accumulation is the basis reveals itself only when the economic laws are known It is 
otherwise with the housing of the poor Every unprejudiced observer sees that the greater the 
centralisation of the means of production the greater is the corresponding heaping together of the 
labourers  within  a  given  space  that  therefore  the  swifter  capitalistic  accumulation  the  more 
miserable are the dwellings of the workingpeople Improvements of towns accompanying the 
increase of wealth by the demolition of badly built quarters the erection of palaces for banks 
warehouses c the widening of streets for business traffic for the carriages of luxury and for 
the introduction of tramways c drive away the poor into even worse and more crowded hiding 
places On the other hand every one knows that the dearness of dwellings is in inverse ratio to 
their excellence and that the mines of misery are exploited by house speculators with more profit 
or  less  cost  than  ever  were  the  mines  of  Potosi  The  antagonistic  character  of  capitalist 
accumulation and therefore of the capitalistic relations of property generally is here so evident 
that even the official English reports on this subject teem with heterodox onslaughts on property 
and  its  rights  With  the  development  of  industry  with  the  accumulation  of  capital  with  the 
growth  and  improvement  of  towns  the  evil  makes  such  progress  that  the  mere  fear  of 
contagious diseases which do not spare even respectability brought into existence from  to 
 no less than  Acts of Parliament on sanitation and that the frightened bourgeois in some 
towns  as  Liverpool  Glasgow  c  took  strenuous  measures  through  their  municipalities 
Nevertheless Dr Simon in his report of  says 
 

 

 

Chapter  

Speaking generally it may be said that the evils are uncontrolled in England  

By order of the Privy Council in  an inquiry was made into the conditions of the housing of 
the agricultural labourers in  of the poorer classes in the towns The results of the admirable 
work of Dr Julian Hunter are to be found in the seventh  and eighth  reports on 
Public  Health  To  the  agricultural  labourers  I  shall  come  later  On  the  condition  of  town 
dwellings I quote as preliminary a general remark of Dr Simon 

Although my official point of view he says is one exclusively physical 
common humanity requires that the other aspect of this evil should not be ignored 
 In its higher degrees it ie overcrowding almost necessarily involves such 
negation of all delicacy such unclean confusion of bodies and bodily functions 
such exposure of animal and sexual nakedness as is rather bestial than human To 
be subject to these influences is a degradation which must become deeper and 
deeper for those on whom it continues to work To children who are born under its 
curse it must often be a very baptism into infamy And beyond all measure 
hopeless is the wish that persons thus circumstanced should ever in other respects 
aspire to that atmosphere of civilisation which has its essence in physical and 
moral cleanliness  

London takes the first place in overcrowded habitations absolutely unfit for human beings 

He feels clear says Dr Hunter on two points first that there are about  
large colonies in London of about  persons each whose miserable 
condition exceeds almost anything he has seen elsewhere in England and is 
almost entirely the result of their bad house accommodation and second that the 
crowded and dilapidated condition of the houses of these colonies is much worse 
than was the case  years ago It is not too much to say that life in parts of 
London and Newcastle is infernal  

Further the betteroff part of the working class together with the small shopkeepers and other 
elements of the lower middle class falls in London more and more under the curse of these vile 
conditions of dwelling in proportion as improvements and with them the demolition of old 
streets and houses advance as factories and the afflux of human beings grow in the metropolis 
and finally as house rents rise with the groundrents 

Rents have become so heavy that few labouring men can afford more than one 
room  

There  is  almost  no  houseproperty  in  London  that  is  not  overburdened  with  a  number  of 
middlemen For the price of land in London is always very high in comparison with its yearly 
revenue  and  therefore  every  buyer  speculates  on  getting  rid  of  it  again  at  a  jury  price  the 
expropriation  valuation  fixed  by  jurymen  or  on  pocketing  an  extraordinary  increase  of  value 
arising from the neighbourhood of some large establishment As a consequence of this there is a 
regular trade in the purchase of fagends of leases  

Gentlemen in this business may be fairly expected to do as they do  get all they 
can from the tenants while they have them and leave as little as they can for their 
successors  

The rents are weekly and these gentlemen run no risk In consequence of the making of railroads 
in the City 

the spectacle has lately been seen in the East of London of a number of families 
wandering about some Saturday night with their scanty worldly goods on their 
backs without any resting place but the workhouse  

 

Chapter  
 
The  workhouses  are  already  overcrowded  and  the  improvements  already  sanctioned  by 
Parliament are only just begun If labourers are driven away by the demolition of their old houses 
they do not leave their old parish or at most they settle down on its borders as near as they can 
get to it 

 

They try of course to remain as near as possible to their workshops The 
inhabitants do not go beyond the same or the next parish parting their tworoom 
tenements into single rooms and crowding even those Even at an advanced 
rent the people who are displaced will hardly be able to get an accommodation so 
good as the meagre one they have left Half the workmen  of the Strand  
walked two miles to their work  

This same Strand a main thoroughfare which gives strangers an imposing idea of the wealth of 
London may serve as an example of the packing together of human beings in that town In one of 
its parishes the Officer of Health reckoned  persons per acre although half the width of the 
Thames was reckoned in It will be selfunderstood that every sanitary measure which as has 
been  the  case  hitherto  in  London  hunts  the  labourers  from  one  quarter  by  demolishing 
uninhabitable houses serves only to crowd them together yet more closely in another 
Either says Dr Hunter the whole proceeding will of necessity stop as an 
absurdity or the public compassion  be effectually aroused to the obligation 
which may now be without exaggeration called national of supplying cover to 
those who by reason of their having no capital cannot provide it for themselves 
though they can by periodical payments reward those who will provide it for 
them  

Admire  this  capitalistic  justice  The  owner  of  land  of  houses  the  businessman  when 
expropriated  by  improvements  such  as  railroads  the  building  of  new  streets  c  not  only 
receives  full  indemnity  He  must  according  to  law  human  and  divine  be  comforted  for  his 
enforced abstinence over and above this by a thumping profit The labourer with his wife and 
child and chattels is thrown out into the street and  if he crowds in too large numbers towards 
quarters  of  the  town  where  the  vestries  insist  on  decency  he  is  prosecuted  in  the  name  of 
sanitation  
Except  London  there  was  at  the  beginning  of  the  th  century  no  single  town  in  England  of 
 inhabitants Only five had more than  Now there are  towns with more than 
 inhabitants 

The result of this change is not only that the class of town people is enormously 
increased but the old closepacked little towns are now centres built round on 
every side open nowhere to air and being no longer agreeable to the rich are 
abandoned by them for the pleasanter outskirts The successors of these rich are 
occupying the larger houses at the rate of a family to each room  and find 
accommodation for two or three lodgers  and a population for which the 
houses were not intended and quite unfit has been created whose surroundings 
are truly degrading to the adults and ruinous to the children  

The more rapidly capital accumulates in an industrial or commercial town the more rapidly flows 
the stream of exploitable human material the more miserable are the improvised dwellings of the 
labourers  
NewcastleonTyne as the centre of a coal and iron district of growing productiveness takes the 
next place after London in the housing inferno Not less than  persons live there in single 
rooms Because of their absolute danger to the community houses in great numbers have lately 

 

Chapter  
 
been  destroyed  by  the  authorities  in  Newcastle  and  Gateshead  The  building  of  new  houses 
progresses very slowly business very quickly The town was therefore in  more full than 
ever Scarcely a room was to let Dr Embleton of the Newcastle Fever Hospital says 

 

There can be little doubt that the great cause of the continuance and spread of the 
typhus has been the overcrowding of human beings and the uncleanliness of 
their dwellings The rooms in which labourers in many cases live are situated in 
confined and unwholesome yards or courts and for space light air and 
cleanliness are models of insufficiency and insalubrity and a disgrace to any 
civilised community in them men women and children lie at night huddled 
together and as regards the men the nightshift succeed the dayshift and the 
dayshift the nightshift in unbroken series for some time together the beds 
having scarcely time to cool the whole house badly supplied with water and 
worse with privies dirty unventilated and pestiferous  

The price per week of such lodgings ranges from d to s 

The town of NewcastleonTyne says Dr Hunter contains a sample of the 
finest tribe of our countrymen often sunk by external circumstances of house and 
street into an almost savage degradation  

As  a  result  of  the  ebbing  and  flowing  of  capital  and  labour  the  state  of  the  dwellings  of  an 
industrial  town  may  today  be  bearable  tomorrow  hideous  Or  the  aedileship  of  the  town  may 
have pulled itself together for the removal of the most shocking abuses Tomorrow like a swarm 
of  locusts  come  crowding  in  masses  of  ragged  Irishmen  or  decayed  English  agricultural 
labourers  They  are  stowed  away  in  cellars  and  lofts  or  the  hitherto  respectable  labourers 
dwelling is transformed into a lodging house whose personnel changes as quickly as the billets in 
the  years war Example Bradford Yorkshire There the municipal philistine was just busied 
with  urban  improvements  Besides  there  were  still  in  Bradford  in      uninhabited 
houses  But now  comes  that  revival  of trade  which the  mildly  liberal Mr  Forster  the  negros 
friend recently crowed over with so much grace With the revival of trade came of course an 
overflow from the waves of the ever fluctuating reserve army or relative surplus population 
The frightful cellar habitations and rooms registered in the list which Dr Hunter obtained from 
the  agent  of  an  Insurance  Company  were  for  the  most  part  inhabited  by  wellpaid  labourers 
They  declared  that  they  would  willingly  pay  for  better  dwellings  if  they  were  to  be  had 
Meanwhile they become degraded they fall ill one and all whilst the mildly liberal Forster M 
P sheds tears over the blessings of Free Trade and the profits of the eminent men of Bradford 
who deal in worsted In the Report of September  Dr Bell one of the poor law doctors of 
Bradford  ascribes  the  frightful  mortality  of  feverpatients  in  his  district  to  the  nature  of  their 
dwellings 

In one small cellar measuring  cubic feet  there are ten persons  
Vincent Street Green Aire Place and the Leys include  houses having  
inhabitants  beds and  privies The beds  and in that term I include any 
roll of dirty old rags or an armful of shavings  have an average of  persons to 
each many have  and  persons to each and some people I am told are 
absolutely without beds they sleep in their ordinary clothes on the bare boards  
young men and women married and unmarried all together I need scarcely add 
that many of these dwellings are dark damp dirty stinking holes utterly unfit for

C The Nomad Population 

We turn now to a class of people whose origin is agricultural but whose occupation is in great 
part industrial They are the light infantry of capital thrown by it according to its needs now to 
this point now to that When they are not on the march they camp Nomad labour is used for 
various operations of building and draining brickmaking limeburning railwaymaking c A 
flying column of pestilence it carries into the places in whose neighbourhood it pitches its camp 
smallpox typhus cholera scarlet fever c In undertakings that involve much capital outlay 
such as railways c the contractor himself generally provides his army with wooden huts and 
the like thus improvising villages without any sanitary provisions outside the control of the local 
boards  very  profitable  to  the  contractor  who  exploits  the  labourers  in  twofold  fashion    as 
soldiers of industry and as tenants According as the wooden hut contains   or  holes its 
inhabitant navvy or whatever he may be has to pay   or  shillings weekly One example 
will suffice In September  Dr Simon reports that the Chairman of the Nuisances Removal 
Committee of the parish of Sevenoaks sent the following denunciation to Sir George Grey Home 
Secretary   

Smallpox cases were rarely heard of in this parish until about twelve months 
ago Shortly before that time the works for a railway from Lewisham to 
Tunbridge were commenced here and in addition to the principal works being in 
the immediate neighbourhood of this town here was also established the dept for 
the whole of the works so that a large number of persons was of necessity 
employed here As cottage accommodation could not be obtained for them all 
huts were built in several places along the line of the works by the contractor Mr 
Jay for their especial occupation These huts possessed no ventilation nor 
drainage and besides were necessarily overcrowded because each occupant had 
to accommodate lodgers whatever the number in his own family might be 
although there were only two rooms to each tenement The consequences were 
according to the medical report we received that in the nighttime these poor 
people were compelled to endure all the horror of suffocation to avoid the 
pestiferous smells arising from the filthy stagnant water and the privies close 
under their windows Complaints were at length made to the Nuisances Removal 
Committee by a medical gentleman who had occasion to visit these huts and he 
spoke of their condition as dwellings in the most severe terms and he expressed 
his fears that some very serious consequences might ensue unless some sanitary 
measures were adopted About a year ago Mr Jay promised to appropriate a hut 
to which persons in his employ who were suffering from contagious diseases 
might at once be removed He repeated that promise on the rd July last but 
although since the date of the last Promise there have been several cases of small
pox in his huts and two deaths from the same disease yet he has taken no steps 
whatever to carry out his promise On the th September instant Mr Kelson 
surgeon reported to me further cases of smallpox in the same huts and he 
described their condition as most disgraceful I should add for your the Home 
Secretarys information that an isolated house called the Pesthouse which is set 
apart for parishioners who might be suffering from infectious diseases has been 
continually occupied by such patients for many months past and is also now

occupied that in one family five children died from smallpox and fever that 
from the st April to the st September this year a period of five months there 
have been no fewer than ten deaths from smallpox in the parish four of them 
being in the huts already referred to that it is impossible to ascertain the exact 
number of persons who have suffered from that disease although they are known 
to be many from the fact of the families keeping it as private as possible  

The labourers in coal and other mines belong to the best paid categories of the British proletariat 
The price at which they buy their wages was shown on an earlier page Here I merely cast a 
hurried glance over the conditions of their dwellings As a rule the exploiter of a mine whether 
its owner or his tenant builds a number of cottages for his hands They receive cottages and coal 
for firing for nothing  ie these form part of their wages paid in kind Those who are not 
lodged  in  this  way  receive  in  compensation    per  annum  The  mining  districts  attract  with 
rapidity a large population made up of the miners themselves and the artisans shopkeepers c 
that  group  themselves  around  them  The  groundrents  are  high  as  they  are  generally  where 
population is dense The master tries therefore to run up within the smallest space possible at 
the mouth of the pit just so many cottages as are necessary to pack together his hands and their 
families If new mines are opened in the neighbourhood or old ones are again set working the 
pressure increases In the construction of the cottages only one point of view is of moment the 
abstinence of the capitalist from all expenditure that is not absolutely unavoidable 

The lodging which is obtained by the pitman and other labourers connected with 
the collieries of Northumberland and Durham says Dr Julian Hunter is 
perhaps on the whole the worst and the dearest of which any large specimens can 
be found in England the similar parishes of Monmouthshire excepted The 
extreme badness is in the high number of men found in one room in the smallness 
of the groundplot on which a great number of houses are thrust the want of 
water the absence of privies and the frequent placing of one house on the top of 
another or distribution into flats  the lessee acts as if the whole colony were 
encamped not resident  
In pursuance of my instructions says Dr Stevens I visited most of the large 
colliery villages in the Durham Union With very few exceptions the general 
statement that no means are taken to secure the health of the inhabitants would be 
true of all of them All colliers are bound bound an expression which like 
bondage dates from the age of serfdom to the colliery lessee or owner for twelve 
months If the colliers express discontent or in any way annoy the viewer a 
mark of memorandum is made against their names and at the annual binding 
such men are turned off It appears to me that no part of the truck system could 
be worse than what obtains in these denselypopulated districts The collier is 
bound to take as part of his hiring a house surrounded with pestiferous influences 
he cannot help himself and it appears doubtful whether anyone else can help him 
except his proprietor he is to all intents and purposes a serf and his proprietor 
first consults his balancesheet and the result is tolerably certain The collier is 
also often supplied with water by the proprietor which whether it be good or bad 
he has to pay for or rather he suffers a deduction for from his wages  

In conflict with public opinion or even with the Officers of Health capital makes no difficulty 
about  justifying  the  conditions  partly  dangerous  partly  degrading  to  which  it  confines  the 
working and domestic life of the labourer on the ground that they are necessary for profit It is 
the same thing when capital abstains from protective measures against dangerous machinery in 

 

Chapter  
 
the factory from appliances for ventilation and for safety in mines c It is the same here with 
the housing of the miners Dr Simon medical officer of the Privy Council in his official Report 
says 

 

In apology for the wretched household accommodation  it is alleged that 
miners are commonly worked on lease that the duration of the lessees interest 
which in collieries is commonly for  years is not so long that he should deem 
it worth his while to create good accommodation for his labourers and for the 
tradespeople and others whom the work attracts that even if he were disposed to 
act liberally in the matter this disposition would commonly be defeated by his 
landlords tendency to fix on him as groundrent an exorbitant additional charge 
for the privilege of having on the surface of the ground the decent and 
comfortable village which the labourers of the subterranean property ought to 
inhabit and that prohibitory price if not actual prohibition equally excludes 
others who might desire to build It would be foreign to the purpose of this report 
to enter upon any discussion of the merits of the above apology Nor here is it 
even needful to consider where it would be that if decent accommodation were 
provided the cost  would eventually fall  whether on landlord or lessee or 
labourer or public But in presence of such shameful facts as are vouched for in 
the annexed reports those of Dr Hunter Dr Stevens c a remedy may well be 
claimed Claims of landlordship are being so used as to do great public wrong 
The landlord in his capacity of mineowner invites an industrial colony to labour 
on his estate and then in his capacity of surfaceowner makes it impossible that 
the labourers whom he collects should find proper lodging where they must live 
The lessee the capitalist exploiter meanwhile has no pecuniary motive for 
resisting that division of the bargain well knowing that if its latter conditions be 
exorbitant the consequences fall not on him that his labourers on whom they fall 
have not education enough to know the value of their sanitary rights that neither 
obscenest lodging nor foulest drinking water will be appreciable inducements 
towards a strike 

D Effect of Crises on the Best Paid Part of the working 

class 

Before I turn to the regular agricultural labourers I may be allowed to show by one 
example how industrial revulsions affect even the bestpaid the aristocracy of the 
working class It will be remembered that the year  brought one of the great crises 
with which the industrial cycle periodically ends The next termination of the cycle was 
due in  Already discounted in the regular factory districts by the cotton famine 
which threw much capital from its wonted sphere into the great centres of the money
market the crisis assumed at this time an especially financial character Its outbreak in 
 was signalised by the failure of a gigantic London Bank immediately followed by 
the collapse of countless swindling companies One of the great London branches of 
industry involved in the catastrophe was iron shipbuilding The magnates of this trade 
had not only overproduced beyond all measure during the overtrading time but they 
had besides engaged in enormous contracts on the speculation that credit would be 
forthcoming to an equivalent extent Now a terrible reaction set in that even at this hour 

 

 
the end of March  continues in this and other London industries To show the 
condition of the labourers I quote the following from the circumstantial report of a 
correspondent of the Morning Star who at the end of  and beginning of  
visited the chief centres of distress 

 

Chapter  

In the East End districts of Poplar Millwall Greenwich Deptford Limehouse 
and Canning Town at least  workmen and their families were in a state of 
utter destitution and  skilled mechanics were breaking stones in the 
workhouse yard after distress of over half a years duration I had great 
difficulty in reaching the workhouse door for a hungry crowd besieged it They 
were waiting for their tickets but the time had not yet arrived for the distribution 
The yard was a great square place with an open shed running all round it and 
several large heaps of snow covered the pavingstones in the middle In the 
middle also were little wickerfenced spaces like sheep pens where in finer 
weather the men worked but on the day of my visit the pens were so snowed up 
that nobody could sit in them Men were busy however in the open shed breaking 
pavingstones into macadam Each man had a big pavingstone for a seat and he 
chipped away at the rimecovered granite with a big hammer until he had broken 
up and think five bushels of it and then he had done his days work and got his 
days pay  threepence and an allowance of food In another part of the yard was a 
rickety little wooden house and when we opened the door of it we found it filled 
with men who were huddled together shoulder to shoulder for the warmth of one 
anothers bodies and breath They were picking oakum and disputing the while as 
to which could work the longest on a given quantity of food  for endurance was 
the point of honour Seven thousand  in this one workhouse  were recipients of 
relief  many hundreds of them  it appeared were six or eight months ago 
earning the highest wages paid to artisans Their number would be more than 
doubled by the count of those who having exhausted all their savings still refuse 
to apply to the parish because they have a little left to pawn Leaving the 
workhouse I took a walk through the streets mostly of little onestorey houses 
that abound in the neighbourhood of Poplar My guide was a member of the 
Committee of the Unemployed My first call was on an ironworker who had 
been seven and twenty weeks out of employment I found the man with his family 
sitting in a little back room The room was not bare of furniture and there was a 
fire in it This was necessary to keep the naked feet of the young children from 
getting frost bitten for it was a bitterly cold day On a tray in front of the fire lay a 
quantity of oakum which the wife and children were picking in return for their 
allowance from the parish The man worked in the stone yard of the workhouse 
for a certain ration of food and threepence per day He had now come home to 
dinner quite hungry as he told us with a melancholy smile and his dinner 
consisted of a couple of slices of bread and dripping and a cup of milkless tea 
The next door at which we knocked was opened by a middleaged woman who 
without saying a word led us into a little back parlour in which sat all her family 
silent and fixedly staring at a rapidly dying fire Such desolation such 
hopelessness was about these people and their little room as I should not care to 
witness again Nothing have they done sir said the woman pointing to her 
boys for six and twenty weeks and all our money gone  all the twenty pounds 

 

 

 

Chapter  

that me and father saved when times were better thinking it would yield a little to 
keep us when we got past work Look at it she said almost fiercely bringing out 
a bankbook with all its well kept entries of money paid in and money taken out 
so that we could see how the little fortune had begun with the first five shilling 
deposit and had grown by little and little to be twenty pounds and how it had 
melted down again till the sum in hand got from pounds to shillings and the last 
entry made the book as worthless as a blank sheet This family received relief 
from the workhouse and it furnished them with just one scanty meal per day 
Our next visit was to an iron labourers wife whose husband had worked in the 
yards We found her ill from want of food lying on a mattress in her clothes and 
just covered with a strip of carpet for all the bedding had been pawned Two 
wretched children were tending her themselves looking as much in need of 
nursing as their mother Nineteen weeks of enforced idleness had brought them to 
this pass and while the mother told the history of that bitter past she moaned as if 
all her faith in a future that should atone for it were dead On getting outside a 
young fellow came running after us and asked us to step inside his house and see 
if anything could be done for him A young wife two pretty children a cluster of 
pawntickets and a bare room were all he had to show  

On the after pains of the crisis of  the following extract from a Tory newspaper It must not 
be forgotten that the Eastend of London which is here dealt with is not only the seat of the iron 
shipbuilding mentioned above but also of a socalled homeindustry always underpaid 

A frightful spectacle was to be seen yesterday in one part of the metropolis 
Although the unemployed thousands of the Eastend did not parade with their 
black flags en masse the human torrent was imposing enough Let us remember 
what these people suffer They are dying of hunger That is the simple and terrible 
fact There are  of them In our presence in one quarter of this wonderful 
metropolis are packed  next door to the most enormous accumulation of wealth 
the world ever saw  cheek by jowl with this are  helpless starving people 
These thousands are now breaking in upon the other quarters always half
starving they cry their misery in our ears they cry to Heaven they tell us from 
their miserable dwellings that it is impossible for them to find work and useless 
for them to beg The local ratepayers themselves are driven by the parochial 
charges to the verge of pauperism  Standard th April   

As it is the fashion amongst English capitalists to quote Belgium as the Paradise of the labourer 
because freedom of labour or what is the same thing freedom of capital is there limited 
neither  by  the  despotism  of  Trades  Unions  nor  by  Factory  Acts  a  word  or  two  on  the 
happiness  of  the  Belgian  labourer  Assuredly  no  one  was  more  thoroughly  initiated  in  the

expenditure  he  calculates  on  very  exact  data  and  whose  conditions  of  nourishment  are  then 
compared with those of the soldier sailor and prisoner The family consists of father mother 
and four children Of these  persons four may be usefully employed the whole year through 
It is assumed that there is no sick person nor one incapable of work among them nor are there 
expenses  for  religious  moral  and  intellectual  purposes  except  a  very  small  sum  for  church 
sittings nor contributions to savings banks or benefit societies nor expenses due to luxury or

the result of improvidence The father and eldest son however allow themselves the use of 
tobacco  and  on  Sundays  go  to  the  cabaret  for  which  a  whole    centimes  a  week  are 
reckoned 

 

From a general compilation of wages allowed to the labourers in different trades 
it follows that the highest average of daily wage is  franc c for men  
centimes for women  centimes for boys and  centimes for girls Calculated 
at this rate the resources of the family would amount at the maximum to  
francs ayear In the family  taken as typical we have calculated all possible 
resources But in ascribing wages to the mother of the family we raise the 
question of the direction of the household How will its internal economy be cared 
for Who will look after the young children Who will get ready the meals do the 
washing and mending This is the dilemma incessantly presented to the 
labourers  

According to this the budget of the family is

We see that few labouring families can reach we will not say the average of the 
sailor or soldier but even that of the prisoner The general average of the cost of 
each prisoner in the different prisons during the period  has been  
centimes for all prisons This figure compared with that of the daily maintenance 
of the labourer shows a difference of  centimes It must be remarked further 
that if in the prisons it is necessary to set down in the account the expenses of 
administration and surveillance on the other hand the prisoners have not to pay 
for their lodging that the purchases they make at the canteens are not included in 
the expenses of maintenance and that these expenses are greatly lowered in 
consequence of the large number of persons that make up the establishments and 
of contracting for or buying wholesale the food and other things that enter into 
their consumption How comes it however that a great number we might say a 
great majority of labourers live in a more economical way It is  by adopting 
expedients the secret of which only the labourer knows by reducing his daily 
rations by substituting ryebread for wheat by eating less meat or even none at 
all and the same with butter and condiments by contenting themselves with one 
or two rooms where the family is crammed together where boys and girls sleep 
side by side often on the same pallet by economy of clothing washing decency

by giving up the Sunday diversions by in short resigning themselves to the most 
painful privations Once arrived at this extreme limit the least rise in the price of 
food stoppage of work illness increases the labourers distress and determines

furniture are pawned and finally the family asks to be enrolled on the list of 
paupers Ducptiaux l c pp    

In fact in this Paradise of capitalists there follows on the smallest change in the price of the 
most  essential  means  of  subsistence  a  change  in  the  number  of  deaths  and  crimes  See

E The British Agricultural Proletariat 

Nowhere does the antagonistic character of capitalistic production and accumulation assert itself 
more  brutally  than  in  the  progress  of  English  agriculture  including  cattlebreeding  and  the 
retrogression of the English agricultural labourer Before I turn to his present situation a rapid 
retrospect Modern agriculture dates in England from the middle of the th century although the 
revolution in landed property from which the changed mode of production starts as a basis has a 
much earlier date  
If we take the statements of Arthur Young a careful observer though a superficial thinker as to 
the  agricultural  labourer  of    the  latter  plays  a  very  pitiable  part  compared  with  his 
predecessor of the end of the th century 

when the labourer  could live in plenty and accumulate wealth  

not to speak of the th century the golden age of the English labourer in town and country 
We need not however go back so far In a very instructive work of the year  we read 

The great farmer is nearly mounted to a level with him the gentleman while 
the poor labourer is depressed almost to the earth His unfortunate situation will 
fully appear by taking a comparative view of it only forty years ago and at 
present Landlord and tenant  have both gone hand in hand in keeping the 
labourer down  

It is then proved in detail that the real agricultural wages between  and  fell nearly  or 
 per cent 

Modern policy says Dr Richard Price also is indeed more favourable to the 
higher classes of people and the consequences may in time prove that the whole 
kingdom will consist of only gentry and beggars or of grandees and slaves  

Nevertheless the position of the English agricultural labourer from  to  with regard to 
his food and dwelling as well as to his selfrespect amusements c is an ideal never attained 
again since that time His average wage expressed in pints of wheat was from  to   
pints in Edens time  only  in  but   
The state of the agricultural labourer at the end of the AntiJacobin War during which landed 
proprietors  farmers  manufacturers  merchants  bankers  stockbrokers  armycontractors  c 
enriched  themselves  so  extraordinarily  has  been  already  indicated  above  The  nominal  wages 
 

 

Chapter  
 
rose  in  consequence  partly  of  the  banknote  depreciation  partly  of  a  rise  in  the  price  of  the 
primary means of subsistence independent of this depreciation But the actual wagevariation can 
be evidenced in a very simple way without entering into details that are here unnecessary The 
Poor Law and its administration were in  and  the same It will be remembered how this 
law was carried out in the country districts in the form of alms the parish made up the nominal 
wage to the nominal sum required for the simple vegetation of the labourer The ratio between the 
wages paid by the farmer and the wagedeficit made good by the parish shows us two things 
First  the  falling  of  wages  below  their  minimum  second  the  degree  in  which  the  agricultural 
labourer was a compound of wage labourer and pauper or the degree in which he had been turned 
into a serf of his parish Let us take one county that represents the average condition of things in 
all counties In Northamptonshire in  the average weekly wage was s d the total yearly 
expenditure of a family of  persons  s d their total income  s deficit made good 
by the parish  s d In  in the same county the weekly wage was s d the total 
yearly  expenditure  of  a  family  of    persons    s  d  their  total income    s  deficit 
made good by the parish  s d In  the deficit was less than  the wage in  
more than half It is selfevident that under these circumstances the meagre comforts that Eden 
still found in the cottage of the agricultural labourer had vanished by  Of all the animals 
kept by the farmer the labourer the instrumentum vocale was thenceforth the most oppressed 
the worst nourished the most brutally treated  
The same state of things went on quietly until 

the Swing riots in  revealed to us ie the ruling classes by the light of 
blazing cornstacks that misery and black mutinous discontent smouldered quite 
as fiercely under the surface of agricultural as of manufacturing England  

At  this  time  Sadler  in  the  House  of  Commons  christened  the  agricultural  labourers  white 
slaves  and  a  Bishop  echoed  the  epithet  in  the  Upper  House  The  most  notable  political 
economist of that period  E G Wakefield  says 

The peasant of the South of England  is not a freeman nor is he a slave he is a 
pauper  

The  time  just  before  the  repeal  of  the  Corn  Laws  threw  new  light  on  the  condition  of  the 
agricultural  labourers  On  the  one  hand  it  was  to  the  interest  of  the  middleclass  agitators  to 
prove how little the Corn Laws protected the actual producers of the corn On the other hand the 
industrial bourgeoisie foamed with sullen rage at the denunciations of the factory system by the 
landed aristocracy at the pretended sympathy with the woes of the factory operatives of those 
utterly corrupt heartless and genteel loafers and at their diplomatic zeal for factory legislation 
It is an old English proverb that when thieves fall out honest men come by their own and in 
fact the noisy passionate quarrel between the two fractions of the ruling class about the question 
which of the two exploited the labourers the more shamefully was on each hand the midwife of 
the  truth  Earl  Shaftesbury  then  Lord  Ashley  was  commanderinchief  in  the  aristocratic 
philanthropic  antifactory  campaign  He  was  therefore  in    a  favourite  subject  in  the 
revelations of the Morning Chronicle on the condition of the agricultural labourers This journal 
then the most important Liberal organ sent special commissioners into the agricultural districts 
who did not content themselves with mere general descriptions and statistics but published the 
names both of the labouring families examined and of their landlords The following list gives the 
wages  paid  in  three  villages  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Blanford  Wimbourne  and  Poole  The 
villages are the property of Mr G Bankes and of the Earl of Shaftesbury It will be noted that 
just like Bankes this low church pope this head of English pietists pockets a great part of the 
miserable wages of the labourers under the pretext of houserent

one half by the introduction of new machinery On the other hand the actual return of the soil 
rose rapidly Greater outlay of capital per acre and as a consequence more rapid concentration 
of  farms  were  essential  conditions  of  the  new  method  At  the  same  time  the  area  under 
cultivation increased from  to  by  acres without reckoning the great area in 
the  Eastern  Counties  which  was  transformed  from  rabbit  warrens  and  poor  pastures  into 
magnificent  cornfields  It  has  already  been  seen  that  at  the  same  time  the  total  number  of 
persons employed in agriculture fell As far as the actual agricultural labourers of both sexes and 
of all ages are concerned their number fell from  in  to   in    If 
the English RegistrarGeneral therefore rightly remarks 

The increase of farmers and farmlabourers since  bears no kind of 
proportion  to the increase of agricultural produce  

this  disproportion  obtains  much  more  for  the  last  period  when  a  positive  decrease  of  the 
agricultural population went hand in hand with increase of the area under cultivation with more 
intensive  cultivation  unheardof  accumulation  of  the  capital  incorporated  with  the  soil  and 
devoted to its working an augmentation in the products of the soil without parallel in the history 
of  English  agriculture  plethoric  rentrolls  of  landlords  and  growing  wealth  of  the  capitalist 
farmers  If  we  take  this  together  with  the  swift  unbroken  extension  of  the  markets  viz  the 
towns and the reign of Free Trade then the agricultural labourer was at last post tot discrimina 
rerum  placed  in  circumstances  that  ought  secundum  artem  to  have  made  him  drunk  with 
happiness  
But Professor Rogers comes to the conclusion that the lot of the English agricultural labourer of 
today not to speak of his predecessor in the last half of the th and in the th century but only 
compared with his predecessor from  to  has changed for the worse to an extraordinary 

 

Chapter  
 
extent that the peasant has again become a serf and a serf worse fed and worse clothed Dr 
Julian Hunter in his epoch making report on the dwellings of the agricultural labourers says 

 

The cost of the hind a name for the agricultural labourer inherited from the 
time of serfdom is fixed at the lowest possible amount on which he can live  
the supplies of wages and shelter are not calculated on the profit to be derived 
from him He is a zero in farming calculations   The means of subsistence 
being always supposed to be a fixed quantity As to any further reduction of his 
income he may say nihil habeo nihil curo He has no fears for the future because 
he has now only the spare supply necessary to keep him He has reached the zero 
from which are dated the calculations of the farmer Come what will he has no 
share either in prosperity or adversity  

In the year  an official inquiry took place into the conditions of nourishment and labour of 
the criminals condemned to transportation and penal servitude The results are recorded in two 
voluminous Blue books Among other things it is said 

From an elaborate comparison between the diet of convicts in the convict prisons 
in England and that of paupers in workhouses and of free labourers in the same 
country  it certainly appears that the former are much better fed than either of 
the two other classes whilst the amount of labour required from an ordinary 
convict under penal servitude is about one half of what would be done by an 
ordinary daylabourer  

A  few  characteristic  depositions  of  witnesses  John  Smith  governor  of  the  Edinburgh  prison 
deposes 

No  The diet of the English prisons is superior to that of ordinary 
labourers in England No  It is the fact  that the ordinary agricultural 
labourers in Scotland very seldom get any meat at all Answer No  Is 
there anything that you are aware of to account for the necessity of feeding them 
very much better than ordinary labourers  Certainly not No  Do you 
think that further experiments ought to be made in order to ascertain whether a 
dietary might not be hit upon for prisoners employed on public works nearly 
approaching to the dietary of free labourers  He the agricultural labourer 
might say I work hard and have not enough to eat and when in prison I did not 
work harder where I had plenty to eat and therefore it is better for me to be in 
prison again than here

The general result of the inquiry by the medical commission of  on the food of the lowest fed 
classes  is  already  known  to  the  reader  He  will  remember  that  the  diet  of  a  great  part  of  the 
agricultural labourers families is below the minimum necessary to arrest starvation diseases 
This is especially the case in all the purely rural districts of Cornwall Devon Somerset Wilts 
Stafford Oxford Berks and Herts

The nourishment obtained by the labourer himself says Dr E Smith is larger 
than the average quantity indicates since he eats a larger share  necessary to 
enable him to perform his labour  of food than the other members of the family 
including in the poorer districts nearly all the meat and bacon The quantity of 
food obtained by the wife and also by the children at the period of rapid growth is 
in many cases in almost every county deficient and particularly in nitrogen  

The male and female servants living with the farmers themselves are sufficiently nourished Their 
number fell from  in  to  in  

The labour of women in the fields says Dr Smith whatever may be its 
disadvantages  is under present circumstances of great advantage to the family 
since it adds that amount of income which  provides shoes and clothing and pays 
the rent and thus enables the family to be better fed  

One of the most remarkable results of the inquiry was that the agricultural labourer of England as 
compared  with  other  parts  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  considerably  the  worst  fed  as  the

To the insufficient quantity and miserable quality of the house accommodation 
generally had says Dr Simon in his official Health Report by our agricultural 

 

 

 

Chapter  

labourers almost every page of Dr Hunters report bears testimony And 
gradually for many years past the state of the labourer in these respects has been 
deteriorating houseroom being now greatly more difficult for him to find and 
when found greatly less suitable to his needs than perhaps for centuries had been 
the case Especially within the last twenty or thirty years the evil has been in very 
rapid increase and the household circumstances of the labourer are now in the 
highest degree deplorable Except in so far as they whom his labour enriches see 
fit to treat him with a kind of pitiful indulgence he is quite peculiarly helpless in 
the matter Whether he shall find houseroom on the land which he contributes to 
till whether the houseroom which he gets shall be human or swinish whether he 
shall have the little space of garden that so vastly lessens the pressure of his 
poverty  all this does not depend on his willingness and ability to pay reasonable 
rent for the decent accommodation he requires but depends on the use which 
others may see fit to make of their right to do as they will with their own 
However large may be a farm there is no law that a certain proportion of 
labourers dwellings much less of decent dwellings shall be upon it nor does 
any law reserve for the labourer ever so little right in that soil to which his 
industry is as needful as sun and rain An extraneous element weighs the balance 
heavily against him  the influence of the Poor Law in its provisions concerning 
settlement and chargeability Under this influence each parish has a pecuniary 
interest in reducing to a minimum the number of its resident labourers  for 
unhappily agricultural labour instead of implying a safe and permanent 
independence for the hardworking labourer and his family implies for the most 
part only a longer or shorter circuit to eventual pauperism  a pauperism which 
during the whole circuit is so near that any illness or temporary failure of 
occupation necessitates immediate recourse to parochial relief  and thus all 
residence of agricultural population in a parish is glaringly an addition to its poor
rates  Large proprietors   have but to resolve that there shall be no 
labourers dwellings on their estates and their estates will thenceforth be virtually 
free from half their responsibility for the poor How far it has been intended in the 
English constitution and law that this kind of unconditional property in land 
should be acquirable and that a landlord doing as he wills with his own should 
be able to treat the cultivators of the soil as aliens whom he may expel from his 
territory is a question which I do not pretend to discuss For that power of 
eviction  does not exist only in theory On a very large scale it prevails in 
practice  prevails  as a main governing condition in the household 
circumstances of agricultural labour As regards the extent of the evil it may 
suffice to refer to the evidence which Dr Hunter has compiled from the last 
census that destruction of houses notwithstanding increased local demands for 
them had during the last ten years been in progress in  separate parishes or 
townships of England so that irrespectively of persons who had been forced to 
become nonresident that is in the parishes in which they work these parishes 
and townships were receiving in  as compared with  a population   
per cent greater into houseroom  per cent less When the process of 
depopulation has completed itself the result says Dr Hunter is a showvillage 
where the cottages have been reduced to a few and where none but persons who 
are needed as shepherds gardeners or gamekeepers are allowed to live regular 
servants who receive the good treatment usual to their class But the land 

 

 

 

Chapter  

requires cultivation and it will be found that the labourers employed upon it are 
not the tenants of the owner but that they come from a neighbouring open village 
perhaps three miles off where a numerous small proprietary had received them 
when their cottages were destroyed in the close villages around Where things are 
tending to the above result often the cottages which stand testify in their 
unrepaired and wretched condition to the extinction to which they are doomed 
They are seen standing in the various stages of natural decay While the shelter 
holds together the labourer is permitted to rent it and glad enough he will often 
be to do so even at the price of decent lodging But no repair no improvement 
shall it receive except such as its penniless occupants can supply And when at 
last it becomes quite uninhabitable  uninhabitable even to the humblest standard 
of serfdom  it will be but one more destroyed cottage and future poorrates will 
be somewhat lightened While great owners are thus escaping from poorrates 
through the depopulation of lands over which they have control the nearest town 
or open village receive the evicted labourers the nearest I say but this nearest 
may mean three or four miles distant from the farm where the labourer has his 
daily toil To that daily toil there will then have to be added as though it were 
nothing the daily need of walking six or eight miles for power of earning his 
bread And whatever farm work is done by his wife and children is done at the 
same disadvantage Nor is this nearly all the toil which the distance occasions 
him In the open village cottagespeculators buy scraps of land which they throng 
as densely as they can with the cheapest of all possible hovels And into those 
wretched habitations which even if they adjoin the open country have some of 
the worst features of the worst town residences crowd the agricultural labourers 
of England  Nor on the other hand must it be supposed that even when the 
labourer is housed upon the lands which he cultivates his household 
circumstances are generally such as his life of productive industry would seem to 
deserve Even on princely estates  his cottage  may be of the meanest 
description There are landlords who deem any stye good enough for their 
labourer and his family and who yet do not disdain to drive with him the hardest 
possible bargain for rent It may be but a ruinous onebedroomed hut having no 
firegrate no privy no opening window no water supply but the ditch no garden 
 but the labourer is helpless against the wrong And the Nuisances Removal 
Acts  are  a mere dead letter  in great part dependent for their working on 
such cottageowners as the one from whom his the labourers hovel is rented 
From brighter but exceptional scenes it is requisite in the interests of justice that 
attention should again be drawn to the overwhelming preponderance of facts 
which are a reproach to the civilisation of England Lamentable indeed must be 
the case when notwithstanding all that is evident with regard to the quality of the 
present accommodation it is the common conclusion of competent observers that 
even the general badness of dwellings is an evil infinitely less urgent than their 
mere numerical insufficiency For years the overcrowding of rural labourers 
dwellings has been a matter of deep concern not only to persons who care for 
sanitary good but to persons who care for decent and moral life For again and 
again in phrases so uniform that they seem stereotyped reporters on the spread of 
epidemic disease in rural districts have insisted on the extreme importance of that 
overcrowding as an influence which renders it a quite hopeless task to attempt 
the limiting of any infection which is introduced And again and again it has been 

 

 

 

Chapter  

pointed out that notwithstanding the many salubrious influences which there are 
in country life the crowding which so favours the extension of contagious 
disease also favours the origination of disease which is not contagious And those 
who have denounced the overcrowded state of our rural population have not been 
silent as to a further mischief Even where their primary concern has been only 
with the injury to health often almost perforce they have referred to other 
relations on the subject In showing how frequently it happens that adult persons 
of both sexes married and unmarried are huddled together in single small 
sleeping rooms their reports have carried the conviction that under the 
circumstances they describe decency must always be outraged and morality 
almost of necessity must suffer Thus for instance in the appendix of my last 
annual report Dr Ord reporting on an outbreak of fever at Wing in 
Buckinghamshire mentions how a young man who had come thither from 
Wingrave with fever in the first days of his illness slept in a room with nine 
other persons Within a fortnight several of these persons were attacked and in the 
course of a few weeks five out of the nine had fever and one died From Dr 
Harvey of St Georges Hospital who on private professional business visited 
Wing during the time of the epidemic I received information exactly in the sense 
of the above report A young woman having fever lay at night in a room 
occupied by her father and mother her bastard child two young men her 
brothers and her two sisters each with a bastard child   persons in all A few 
weeks ago  persons slept in it  

Dr  Hunter  investigated    cottages  of  agricultural  labourers  not  only  in  the  purely 
agricultural districts but in all counties of England Of these  had only one bedroom often

unapproachable beauty Its plaster walls bulged very like a ladys dress in a curtsey One gable 
end was convex the other concave and on this last unfortunately stood the chimney a curved 
tube  of  clay  and  wood  like  an  elephants  trunk  A  long  stick  served  as  prop  to  prevent  the 
chimney from falling The doorway and window were rhomboidal Of  houses visited only

The poor are none the better for them if you build  they will let fast enough in fact the 
more you build the more they want  
according to him the houses give birth to the inhabitants who then by a law of Nature press on 
the means of housing Dr Hunter remarks 
Now these poor must come from somewhere and as there is no particular attraction such as 
doles at Badsey it must be repulsion from some other unfit place which will send them here If 
each could find an allotment near his work he would not prefer Badsey where he pays for his 
scrap of ground twice as much as the farmer pays for his  
The  continual  emigration  to  the  towns  the  continual  formation  of  surplus  population  in  the 
country through the concentration of farms conversion of arable land into pasture machinery 
c and the continual eviction of the agricultural population by the destruction of their cottages 
go  hand  in  hand  The  more  empty  the  district  is  of  men  the  greater  is  its  relative  surplus 
population the greater is their pressure on the means of employment the greater is the absolute 

 

 

Chapter  
 
excess of the agricultural population over the means for housing it the greater therefore in the 
villages  is  the  local  surplus  population  and  the  most  pestilential  packing  together  of  human 
beings The packing together of knots of men in scattered little villages and small country towns 
corresponds  to  the  forcible  draining  of  men  from  the  surface  of  the  land  The  continuous 
superseding of the agricultural labourers in spite of their diminishing number and the increasing 
mass of their products gives birth to their pauperism Their pauperism is ultimately a motive to 
their eviction and the chief source of their miserable housing which breaks down their last power 
of resistance and makes them more slaves of the landed proprietors and the farmers Thus the 
minimum of wages becomes a law of Nature to them On the other hand the land in spite of its 
constant relative surplus population is at the same time underpopulated This is seen not only 
locally  at  the  points  where  the  efflux  of  men  to  towns  mines  railroadmaking  c  is  most 
marked It is to be seen everywhere in harvesttime as well as in spring and summer at those 
frequently recurring times when English agriculture so careful and intensive wants extra hands 
There are always too many agricultural labourers for the ordinary and always too few for the 
exceptional  or  temporary  needs  of  the  cultivation  of  the  soil  Hence  we  find  in  the  official 
documents  contradictory  complaints  from  the  same  places  of  deficiency  and  excess  of  labour 
simultaneously  The  temporary  or  local  want  of  labour  brings  about  no  rise  in  wages  but  a 
forcing of the women and children into the fields and exploitation at an age constantly lowered 
As soon as the exploitation of the women and children takes place on a larger scale it becomes in 
turn a new means of making a surplus population of the male agricultural labourer and of keeping 
down his wage In the east of England thrives a beautiful fruit of this vicious circle  the socalled 
gangsystem to which I must briefly return here  
The gangsystem obtains almost exclusively in the counties of Lincoln Huntingdon Cambridge 
Norfolk Suffolk and Nottingham here and there in the neighbouring counties of Northampton 
Bedford and Rutland Lincolnshire will serve us as an example A large part of this county is new 
land marsh formerly or even as in others of the eastern counties just named won lately from the 
sea The  steamengine  has  worked  wonders in the  way  of  drainage  What  were  once  fens  and 
sandbanks bear now a luxuriant sea of corn and the highest of rents The same thing holds of the 
alluvial lands won by human endeavour as in the island of Axholme and other parishes on the 
banks of the Trent In proportion as the new farms arose not only were no new cottages built old 
ones were demolished and the supply of labour had to come from open villages miles away by 
long roads that wound along the sides of the hills There alone had the population formerly found 
shelter from the incessant floods of the wintertime The labourers that dwell on the farms of 
  acres  they  are  called  confined  labourers  are  solely  employed  on  such  kinds  of 
agricultural work as is permanent difficult and carried on by aid of horses For every  acres 
there  is  on  an  average  scarcely  one  cottage  A  fen  farmer  eg  gave  evidence  before  the 
Commission of Inquiry 

I farm  acres all arable land I have not one cottage on my farm I have only 
one labourer on my farm now I have four horsemen lodging about We get light 
work done by gangs  

The soil requires much light field labour such as weeding hoeing certain processes of manuring 
removing of stones c This is done by the gangs or organised bands that dwell in the open 
villages  
The gang consists of  to  or  persons women young persons of both sexes  years of 
age although the boys are for the most part eliminated at the age of  and children of both 
sexes    years  of  age  At  the  head  is  the  gang  master  always  an  ordinary  agricultural 
labourer generally what is called a bad lot a scapegrace unsteady drunken but with a dash of 

 

 

Chapter  
 
enterprise and savoirfaire He is the recruitingsergeant for the gang which works under him 
not under the farmer He generally arranges with the latter for piecework and his income which 
on the average is not very much above that of an ordinary agricultural labourer depends almost 
entirely upon the dexterity with which he manages to extract within the shortest time the greatest 
possible amount of labour from his gang The farmers have discovered that women work steadily 
only under the direction of men but that women and children once set going impetuously spend 
their lifeforce  as Fourier knew  while the adult male labourer is shrewd enough to economise 
his as much as he can The gangmaster goes from one farm to another and thus employs his 
gang from  to  months in the year Employment by him is therefore much more lucrative and 
more  certain  for  the  labouring  families  than  employment  by  the  individual  farmer  who  only 
employs children occasionally This circumstance so completely rivets his influence in the open 
villages that children are generally only to be hired through his instrumentality The lending out 
of these individually independently of the gang is his second trade  
The  drawbacks  of  the  system  are  the  overwork  of  the  children  and  young  persons  the 
enormous  marches  that  they  make  daily  to  and  from  the  farms      and  sometimes    miles 
distant finally the demoralisation of the gang Although the gangmaster who in some districts 
is called the driver is armed with a long stick he uses it but seldom and complaints of brutal 
treatment are exceptional He is a democratic emperor or a kind of Pied Piper of Hamelin He 
must therefore be popular with his subjects and he binds them to himself by the charms of the 
gipsy  life  under  his  direction  Coarse  freedom  a  noisy  jollity  and  obscenest  impudence  give 
attractions to the gang Generally the gangmaster pays up in a public house then he returns home 
at the head of the procession reeling drunk propped up right and left by a stalwart virago while 
children and young persons bring up the rear boisterous and singing chaffing and bawdy songs 
On the return journey what Fourier calls phanerogamie is the order of the day The getting with 
child  of  girls  of    and    by  their  male  companions  of  the  same  age  is  common  The  open 
villages which supply the contingent of the gang become Sodoms and Gomorrahs and have 
twice as high a rate of illegitimate births as the rest of the kingdom The moral character of girls 
bred in these schools when married women was shown above Their children when opium does 
not give them the finishing stroke are born recruits of the gang  
The gang in its classical form just described is called the public common or tramping gang For 
there are also private gangs These are made up in the same way as the common gang but count 
fewer members and work not under a gangmaster but under some old farm servant whom the 
farmer does not know how to employ in any better way The gipsy fun has vanished here but 
according to all witnesses the payment and treatment of the children is worse  
The gangsystem which during the last years has steadily increased clearly does not exist for 
the sake of the gangmaster It exists for the enrichment of the large farmers  and indirectly of 
the landlords For the farmer there is no more ingenious method of keeping his labourers well 
below  the  normal  level  and  yet  of  always  having  an  extra  hand  ready  for  extra  work  of 
extracting the greatest possible amount of labour with the least possible amount of money  and 
of  making  adult  male  labour  redundant  From  the  exposition  already  made  it  will  be 
understood  why  on  the  one  hand  a  greater  or  less  lack  of  employment  for  the  agricultural 
labourer is admitted while on the other the gangsystem is at the same time declared necessary 
on account of the want of adult male labour and its migration to the towns The cleanly weeded 
land and the uncleanly human weeds of Lincolnshire are pole and counterpole of capitalistic 
production  

 

 

 

F Ireland 

Chapter  

In concluding this section we must travel for a moment to Ireland First the main facts of the 
case  
The population of Ireland had in  reached  in  it had dwindled to  
in  to  in  to  millions nearly to its level in  The diminution began 
with the famine year  so that Ireland in less than twenty years lost more than  ths of its 
people    Its  total  emigration  from  May    to  July    numbered    the 
emigration during the years  was more than halfamillion The number of inhabited 
houses fell from  by  From  the number of holdings of  to  
acres increased  that of holdings over  acres  whilst the total number of all 
farms fell  a fall therefore solely due to the suppression of farms under  acres  ie to 
their centralisation

The decrease of the population was naturally accompanied by a decrease in the mass of products

million emigrated and the absolute number of people sank by more than  of a million From

England  a  country  with  fully  developed  capitalist  production  and  preeminently  industrial 
would have bled to death with such a drain of population as Ireland has suffered But Ireland is at 
present only an agricultural district of England marked off by a wide channel from the country to 
which it yields corn wool cattle industrial and military recruits  
The  depopulation  of  Ireland  has  thrown  much  of  the  land  out  of  cultivation  has  greatly 
diminished the produce of the soil and in spite of the greater area devoted to cattle breeding 
has brought about in some of its branches an absolute diminution in others an advance scarcely 
worthy  of  mention  and  constantly  interrupted  by  retrogressions  Nevertheless  with  the fall  in 
numbers of the population rents and farmers profits rose although the latter not as steadily as 
the former The reason of this is easily comprehensible On the one hand with the throwing of 
small holdings into large ones and the change of arable into pasture land a larger part of the 
whole produce was transformed into surplusproduce The surplusproduce increased although 
the total produce of which it formed a fraction decreased On the other hand the money value of 
this surplusproduce increased yet more rapidly than its mass in consequence of the rise in the 
English market price of meat wool c during the last  and especially during the last  
years  
 

 

Chapter  
 
The scattered means of production that serve the producers themselves as means of employment 
and  of  subsistence  without  expanding  their  own  value  by  the  incorporation  of  the  labour  of 
others are no more capital than a product consumed by its own producer is a commodity If with 
the  mass  of  the  population  that  of  the  means  of  production  employed  in  agriculture  also 
diminished the mass of the capital employed in agriculture increased because a part of the means 
of production that were formerly scattered was concentrated and turned into capital  
The  total  capital  of  Ireland  outside  agriculture  employed  in  industry  and  trade  accumulated 
during the last two decades slowly and with great and constantly recurring fluctuations so much 
the more rapidly did the concentration of its individual constituents develop And however small 
its absolute increase in proportion to the dwindling population it had increased largely  
Here then under our own eyes and on a large scale a process is revealed than which nothing 
more  excellent  could  be  wished  for  by  orthodox  economy  for  the  support  of  its  dogma  that 
misery  springs  from  absolute  surplus  population  and  that  equilibrium  is  reestablished  by 
depopulation This is a far more important experiment than was the plague in the middle of the 
th century so belauded of Malthusians Note further If only the navet of the schoolmaster 
could  apply  to  the  conditions  of  production  and  population  of  the  nineteenth  century  the 
standard of the th this navet into the bargain overlooked the fact that whilst after the plague 
and  the  decimation  that  accompanied  it  followed  on  this  side  of  the  Channel  in  England 
enfranchisement and enrichment of the agricultural population on that side in France followed 
greater servitude and more misery  
The Irish famine of  killed more than  people but it killed poor devils only To the 
wealth of the country it did not the slightest damage The exodus of the next  years an exodus 
still  constantly  increasing  did  not  as  eg  the  Thirty  Years  War  decimate  along  with  the 
human  beings  their  means  of  production  Irish  genius  discovered  an  altogether  new  way  of 
spiriting  a  poor  people  thousands  of  miles  away  from  the  scene  of  its  misery  The  exiles 
transplanted to the United States send home sums of money every year as travelling expenses for 
those  left  behind  Every  troop  that  emigrates  one  year  draws  another  after  it  the  next  Thus 
instead of costing Ireland anything emigration forms one of the most lucrative branches of its 
export trade Finally it is a systematic process which does not simply make a passing gap in the 
population but sucks out of it every year more people than are replaced by the births so that the 
absolute level of the population falls year by year  
What  were  the  consequences  for  the  Irish  labourers  left  behind  and  freed  from  the  surplus 
population That the relative surplus population is today as great as before  that wages are 
just as low that the oppression of the labourers has increased that misery is forcing the country 
towards  a  new  crisis  The  facts  are  simple  The  revolution  in  agriculture  has  kept  pace  with 
emigration  The  production  of  relative  surplus  population  has  more  than  kept  pace  with  the 
absolute depopulation A glance at table C shows that the change of arable to pasture land must 
work  yet  more  acutely  in  Ireland  than  in  England  In  England  the  cultivation  of  green  crops 
increases with the breeding of cattle in Ireland it decreases Whilst a large number of acres that 
were formerly tilled lie idle or are turned permanently into grassland a great part of the waste 
land  and  peat  bogs  that  were  unused  formerly  become  of  service  for  the  extension  of  cattle
breeding The smaller and medium farmers  I reckon among these all who do not cultivate more 
than  acres  still make up about ths of the whole number They are one after the other 
and  with  a  degree  of  force  unknown  before  crushed  by  the  competition  of  an  agriculture 
managed  by  capital  and  therefore  they  continually  furnish  new  recruits  to  the  class  of  wage 
labourers The one great industry of Ireland linenmanufacture requires relatively few adult men 
and only employs altogether in spite of its expansion since the price of cotton rose in  

 

 

Chapter  
 
a  comparatively  insignificant  part  of  the  population  Like  all  other  great  modern  industries  it 
constantly  produces  by  incessant  fluctuations  a  relative  surplus  population  within  its  own 
sphere even with an absolute increase in the mass of human beings absorbed by it The misery of 
the  agricultural  population  forms  the  pedestal  for  gigantic  shirtfactories  whose  armies  of 
labourers are for the most part scattered over the country Here we encounter again the system 
described above of domestic industry which in underpayment and overwork possesses its own 
systematic means for creating supernumerary labourers Finally although the depopulation has 
not such destructive consequences as would result in a country with fully developed capitalistic 
production it does not go on without constant reaction upon the homemarket The gap which 
emigration causes here limits not only the local demand for labour but also the incomes of small 
shopkeepers artisans tradespeople generally Hence the diminution in incomes between  and 
 in Table E  
A clear statement of the condition of the agricultural labourers in Ireland is to be found in the 
Reports  of  the  Irish  Poor  Law  Inspectors    Officials  of  a  government  which  is 
maintained  only  by  bayonets  and  by  a  state  of  siege  now  open  now  disguised  they  have  to 
observe all the precautions of language that their colleagues in England disdain In spite of this 
however they do not let their government cradle itself in illusions According to them the rate of 
wages in the country still very low has within the last  years risen  per cent and stands 
now on the average at s to s per week But behind this apparent rise is hidden an actual fall 
in  wages  for  it  does  not  correspond  at  all  to  the  rise  in  price  of  the  necessary  means  of 
subsistence  that  has  taken  place  in  the  meantime  For  proof  the  following  extract  from  the 
official accounts of an Irish workhouse

Necessaries

The  price  of  the  necessary  means  of  subsistence  is  therefore  fully  twice  and  that  of  clothing 
exactly twice as much as they were  years before  
Even apart from this disproportion the mere comparison of the rate of wages expressed in gold 
would give a result far from accurate Before the famine the great mass of agricultural wages 
were paid in kind only the smallest part in money today payment in money is the rule From 
this it follows that whatever the amount of the real wage its money rate must rise 

Previous to the famine the labourer enjoyed his cabin  with a rood or halfacre 
or acre of land and facilities for  a crop of potatoes He was able to rear his pig 
and keep fowl But they now have to buy bread and they have no refuse upon 
which they can feed a pig or fowl and they have consequently no benefit from the 
sale of a pig fowl or eggs  

In fact formerly the agricultural labourers were but the smallest of the small farmers and formed 
for  the  most  part  a  kind  of  rearguard  of  the  medium  and  large  farms  on  which  they  found 
employment Only since the catastrophe of  have they begun to form a fraction of the class 
of  purely  wage  labourers  a  special  class  connected  with  its  wagemasters  only  by  monetary 
relations  
We know what were the conditions of their dwellings in  Since then they have grown yet 
worse A part of the agricultural labourers which however grows less day by day dwells still on 

 

Chapter  
 
the holdings of the farmers in overcrowded huts whose hideousness far surpasses the worst that 
the  English  agricultural  labourers  offered  us  in  this  way  And  this  holds  generally  with  the 
exception of certain tracts of Ulster in the south in the counties of Cork Limerick Kilkenny 
c  in  the  east  in  Wicklow  Wexford  c  in  the  centre  of  Ireland  in  Kings  and  Queens 
County Dublin c in the west in Sligo Roscommon Mayo Galway c 

 

The agricultural labourers huts an inspector cries out are a disgrace to the 
Christianity and to the civilisation of this country  

In order to increase the attractions of these holes for the labourers the pieces of land belonging 
thereto from time immemorial are systematically confiscated 

The mere sense that they exist subject to this species of ban on the part of the 
landlords and their agents has  given birth in the minds of the labourers to 
corresponding sentiments of antagonism and dissatisfaction towards those by 
whom they are thus led to regard themselves as being treated as  a proscribed 
race  

The first act of the agricultural revolution was to sweep away the huts situated on the field of 
labour This was done on the largest scale and as if in obedience to a command from on high 
Thus  many  labourers  were  compelled  to  seek  shelter  in  villages  and  towns  There  they  were 
thrown like refuse into garrets holes cellars and corners in the worst back slums Thousands of 
Irish families who according to the testimony of the English eaten up as these are with national 
prejudice are notable for their rare attachment to the domestic hearth for their gaiety and the 
purity of their homelife found themselves suddenly transplanted into hotbeds of vice The men 
are now obliged to seek work of the neighbouring farmers and are only hired by the day and 
therefore under the most precarious form of wage Hence 

they sometimes have long distances to go to and from work often get wet and 
suffer much hardship not unfrequently ending in sickness disease and want   
 The towns have had to receive from year to year what was deemed to be the 
surplus labour of the rural division and then people still wonder there is still 
a surplus of labour in the towns and villages and either a scarcity or a threatened 
scarcity in some of the country divisions The truth is that this want only 
becomes perceptible in harvesttime or during spring or at such times as 
agricultural operations are carried on with activity at other periods of the year 
many hands are idle that from the digging out of the main crop of potatoes in 
October until the early spring following  there is no employment for them 
and further that during the active times they are subject to broken days and to 
all kinds of interruptions  

These results of the agricultural revolution  ie the change of arable into pasture land the use of 
machinery the most rigorous economy of labour c are still further aggravated by the model 
landlords who instead of spending their rents in other countries condescend to live in Ireland on 
their demesnes In order that the law of supply and demand may not be broken these gentlemen 
draw their 

laboursupply  chiefly from their small tenants who are obliged to attend when 
required to do the landlords work at rates of wages in many instances 
considerably under the current rates paid to ordinary labourers and without regard 
to the inconvenience or loss to the tenant of being obliged to neglect his own 
business at critical periods of sowing or reaping  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The uncertainty and irregularity of employment the constant return and long duration of gluts of 
labour all these symptoms of a relative surplus population figure therefore in the reports of the 
Poor  Law  administration  as  so  many  hardships  of  the  agricultural  proletariat  It  will  be 
remembered that we met in the English agricultural proletariat with a similar spectacle But the 
difference is that in England an industrial country the industrial reserve recruits itself from the 
country districts whilst in Ireland an agricultural country the agricultural reserve recruits itself 
from  the  towns  the  cities  of  refuge  of  the  expelled  agricultural  labourers  In  the  former  the 
supernumeraries of agriculture are transformed into factory operatives in the latter those forced 
into the  towns  whilst  at  the  same  time  they  press  on  the  wages  in  towns  remain  agricultural 
labourers and are constantly sent back to the country districts in search of work  
The official inspectors sum up the material condition of the agricultural labourer as follows 

Though living with the strictest frugality his own wages are barely sufficient to 
provide food for an ordinary family and pay his rent and he depends upon other 
sources for the means of clothing himself his wife and children The 
atmosphere of these cabins combined with the other privations they are subjected 
to has made this class particularly susceptible to low fever and pulmonary 
consumption  

After this it is no wonder that according to the unanimous testimony of the inspectors a sombre 
discontent runs through the ranks of this class that they long for the return of the past loathe the 
present despair of the future give themselves up to the evil influence of agitators and have 
only one fixed idea to emigrate to America This is the land of Cockaigne into which the great 
Malthusian panacea depopulation has transformed green Erin  
What a happy life the Irish factory operative leads one example will show 

On my recent visit to the North of Ireland says the English Factory Inspector 
Robert Baker I met with the following evidence of effort in an Irish skilled 
workman to afford education to his children and I give his evidence verbatim as I 
took it from his mouth That he was a skilled factory hand may be understood 
when I say that he was employed on goods for the Manchester market Johnson 
 I am a beetler and work from  in the morning till  at night from Monday to 
Friday Saturday we leave off at  p m and get three hours of it for meals and 
rest I have five children in all For this work I get s d a week my wife 
works here also and gets s a week The oldest girl who is  minds the house 
She is also cook and all the servant we have She gets the young ones ready for 
school A girl going past the house wakes me at half past five in the morning My 
wife gets up and goes along with me We get nothing to eat before we come to 
work The child of  takes care of the little children all the day and we get 
nothing till breakfast at eight At eight we go home We get tea once a week at 
other times we get stirabout sometimes of oatmeal sometimes of Indian meal as 
we are able to get it In the winter we get a little sugar and water to our Indian 
meal In the summer we get a few potatoes planting a small patch ourselves and 
when they are done we get back to stirabout Sometimes we get a little milk as it 
may be So we go on from day to day Sunday and week day always the same the 
year round I am always very much tired when I have done at night We may see a 
bit of flesh meat sometimes but very seldom Three of our children attend school 
for whom we pay d a week a head Our rent is d a week Peat for firing costs 
s d a fortnight at the very lowest  

Such are Irish wages such is Irish life

In fact the misery of Ireland is again the topic of the day in England At the end of  and the 
beginning of  one of the Irish land magnates Lord Dufferin set about its solution in The 
Times Wie menschlich von solch grossem Herrn  
From  Table  E  we  saw  that  during    of    of  total  profits  three  surplusvalue 
makers pocketed only  that in  however out of  total profits the same 
three virtuosi of abstinence pocketed  in   surplusvalue makers reached to 
  in      surplusvalue  makers  reached  to    in      surplusvalue 
makers  in   surplusvalue makers  in   surplusvalue 
makers  nearly half of the total annual profit in   surplusvalue makers 
 more than half of the total annual profit But the lions share which an inconceivably 
small  number  of  land  magnates  in  England  Scotland  and  Ireland  swallow  up  of  the  yearly 
national rental is so monstrous that the wisdom of the English State does not think fit to afford 
the same statistical materials about the distribution of rents as about the distribution of profits 
Lord Dufferin is one of those land magnates That rentrolls and profits can ever be excessive 
or that their plethora is in any way connected with plethora of the peoples misery is of course 
an idea as disreputable as unsound He keeps to facts The fact is that as the Irish population 
diminishes  the  Irish  rentrolls  swell  that  depopulation  benefits  the  landlords  therefore  also 
benefits the soil and therefore the people that mere accessory of the soil He declares therefore 
that  Ireland  is  still  overpopulated  and  the  stream  of  emigration  still  flows  too  lazily  To  be 
perfectly happy Ireland must get rid of at least onethird of a million of labouring men Let no 
man imagine that this lord poetic into the bargain is a physician of the school of Sangrado who 
as often as he did not find his patient better ordered phlebotomy and again phlebotomy until the 
patient lost his sickness at the same time as his blood Lord Dufferin demands a new bloodletting 
of onethird of a million only instead of about two millions in fact without the getting rid of 
these the millennium in Erin is not to be The proof is easily given

Centralisation  has  from    to    destroyed  principally  farms  of  the  first  three  categories 
under    and  not  over    acres  These  above  all  must  disappear  This  gives   
supernumerary  farmers and  reckoning  the  families  the  low  average  of    persons   
persons On the extravagant supposition that after the agricultural revolution is complete one
fourth of these are again absorbable there remain for emigration  persons Categories  
  of over  and not over  acres are as was known long since in England too small for 
capitalistic  cultivation  of  corn  and for sheepbreeding  are  almost  vanishing  quantities  On the 
same  supposition  as  before  therefore  there  are  further    persons  to  emigrate  total 
 And as lapptit vient en mangeant Rentrolls eyes will soon discover that Ireland 
with    millions  is  still  always  miserable  and  miserable  because  she  is  overpopulated 
Therefore her depopulation must go yet further that thus she may fulfil her true destiny that of 
an English sheepwalk and cattlepasture  
Like  all  good  things  in  this  bad  world  this  profitable  method  has  its  drawbacks  With  the 
accumulation  of  rents  in  Ireland  the  accumulation  of  the  Irish  in  America  keeps  pace  The 
Irishman banished by sheep and ox reappears on the other side of the ocean as a Fenian and 
face  to  face  with  the  old queen of the  seas rises  threatening  and  more threatening  the  young

 If the reader reminds me of Malthus whose Essay on Population appeared in  I remind him 
that this work in its first form is nothing more than a schoolboyish superficial plagiary of De Foe Sir 
James Steuart Townsend Franklin Wallace c and does not contain a single sentence thought out 
by himself The great sensation this pamphlet caused was due solely to party  interest The  French 
Revolution  had  found  passionate  defenders  in  the  United  Kingdom  the  principle  of  population 
slowly worked out in the eighteenth century and then in the midst of a great social crisis proclaimed 
with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings of Condorcet c was greeted with 
jubilance by the English oligarchy as the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development 
Malthus  hugely  astonished  at  his  success  gave  himself  to  stuffing  into  his  book  materials 
superficially compiled and adding to it new matter not discovered but annexed by him Note further 
Although  Malthus  was  a  parson  of  the  English  State  Church  he  had  taken  the  monastic  vow  of 
celibacy  one of the conditions of holding a Fellowship in Protestant Cambridge University Socios 
collegiorum maritos esse non permittimus sed statim postquam quis uxorem duxerit socius collegii 
desinat  esse  Reports  of  Cambridge  University  Commission  p    This  circumstance 
favourably  distinguishes  Malthus  from  the  other  Protestant  parsons  who  have  shuffled  off  the 
command  enjoining  celibacy  of  the  priesthood  and  have  taken  Be  fruitful  and  multiply  as  their 
special Biblical mission in such a degree that they generally contribute to the increase of population to 
a  really  unbecoming  extent  whilst  they  preach  at  the  same  time  to  the  labourers  the  principle  of 
population It is characteristic that the economic fall of man the Adams apple the urgent appetite 
the checks which tend to blunt the shafts of Cupid as Parson Townsend waggishly puts it that this 
delicate question was and is monopolised by the Reverends of Protestant Theology or rather of the 
Protestant  Church  With  the  exception  of  the  Venetian  monk  Ortes  an  original  and  clever  writer 
most  of  the  population  theory  teachers  are  Protestant  parsons  For  instance  Bruckner  Thorie  du 
Systme  animal  Leyde    in  which  the  whole  subject  of  the  modern  population  theory  is 
exhausted  and  to  which  the  passing  quarrel  between  Quesnay  and  his  pupil  the  elder  Mirabeau 
furnished ideas on the same topic then Parson Wallace Parson Townsend Parson Malthus and his 
pupil  the  archParson  Thomas  Chalmers  to  say  nothing  of  lesser  reverend  scribblers  in  this  line 
Originally  Political  Economy  was  studied  by  philosophers  like  Hobbes  Locke  Hume  by 
businessmen  and  statesmen  like  Thomas  More  Temple  Sully  De  Witt  North  Law  Vanderlint 
Cantillon Franklin and especially and with the greatest success by medical men like Petty Barbon 
Mandeville Quesnay Even in the middle of the eighteenth century the Rev Mr Tucker a notable 
economist of his time excused himself for meddling with the things of Mammon Later on and in 
truth with this very Principle of population struck the hour of the Protestant parsons Petty who 
regarded  the  population  as  the  basis  of  wealth  and  was  like  Adam  Smith  an  outspoken  foe  to 
parsons says as if he had a presentiment of their bungling interference that Religion best flourishes 
when  the  Priests  are  most  mortified  as  was  before  said  of  the  Law  which  best  flourisheth  when 
lawyers have least to do He advises the Protestant priests therefore if they once for all will not 
follow the Apostle Paul and mortify themselves by celibacy not to breed more Churchmen than 
the Benefices as they now stand shared out will receive that is to say if there be places for about 
twelve thousand in England and Wales it will not be safe to breed up  ministers for then the 
twelve thousand which are unprovided for will seek ways how to get themselves a livelihood which 
they  cannot  do  more  easily  than  by  persuading  the people  that  the  twelve  thousand  incumbents  do 
poison or starve their souls and misguide them in their way to Heaven Petty A Treatise of Taxes

time is shown by the following In A Letter to A Smith LLD On the Life Death and Philosophy 
of his Friend David Hume By one of the People called Christians th Edition Oxford  Dr

vineyard of the Lord 
 The limit however to the employment of both the operative and the labourer is the same namely 
the possibility of the employer realising a profit on the produce of their industry If the rate of wages is 
such as to reduce the masters gains below the average profit of capital he will cease to employ them 
or he will only employ them on condition of submission to a reduction of wages John Wade l c p

 If we now return to our first inquiry wherein it was shown that capital itself is only the result of 
human labour it seems quite incomprehensible that  man can have fallen under the domination of 
capital his own product can be subordinated to it and as in reality this is beyond dispute the case

 Added in the th German edition  The law of progressive diminution of the relative magnitude of 
variable capital and its effect on the condition of the class of wage workers is conjectured rather than 
understood  by  some  of  the  prominent  economists  of  the  classical  school  The  greatest  service  was 
rendered here by John Barton although he like all the rest lumps together constant and fixed capital 
variable and circulating capital He says  
The demand for labour depends on the increase of circulating and not of fixed capital Were it true 
that the proportion between these two sorts of capital is the same at all times and in all circumstances 
then indeed it follows that the number of labourers employed is in proportion to the wealth of the 
state  But  such  a  proposition  has  not  the  semblance  of  probability  As  arts  are  cultivated  and 
civilisation is extended fixed capital bears a larger and larger proportion to circulating capital The 
amount of fixed capital employed in the production of a piece of British muslin is at least a hundred 
probably a thousand times  greater than that employed in a similar piece of Indian muslin And the 
proportion of circulating capital is a hundred or thousand times less  the whole of the annual savings 
added to the fixed capital would have no effect in increasing the demand for labour John Barton

hillock  of  lime  ashes  the  refuse  of  limekilns  and  which  are  used  as  dwellings and  occupied by 
labourers and others employed in the construction of a railway now in course of construction through 
that neighbourhood The excavations are small and damp and have no drains or privies about them 
and  not  the  slightest  means  of  ventilation  except  up  a  hole  pulled  through  the  top  and  used  for  a

 l c p  The English agricultural labourer receives only  as much milk and  as much bread 
as the Irish Arthur Young in his Tour in Ireland at the beginning of this century already noticed 
the  better  nourishment  of  the  latter  The  reason  is  simply  this  that  the  poor  Irish  farmer  is 
incomparably  more humane than the rich English As regards Wales that which is said in the  text 
holds only for the southwest All the doctors there agree that the increase of the deathrate through 
tuberculosis scrofula etc increases in intensity with the deterioration of the physical condition of the 
population and all ascribe this deterioration to poverty His the farm labourers keep is reckoned at 
about five pence a day but in many districts it was said to be of much less cost to the farmer himself 
very poor A morsel of the salt meat or bacon  salted and dried to the texture of mahogany and 
hardly  worth  the  difficult  process  of  assimilation    is  used  to  flavour  a  large  quantity  of  broth  or 
gruel  of  meal  and  leeks  and  day  after  day  this  is  the  labourers  dinner The  advance  of  industry 
resulted for him in this harsh and damp climate in the abandonment of the solid homespun clothing 
in  favour  of  the  cheap  and  socalled  cotton  goods  and  of  stronger  drinks  for  socalled  tea  The 
agriculturist after several hours exposure to wind and rain pins his cottage to sit by a fire of peat or 
of  balls  of  clay  and  small  coal  kneaded  together  from  which  volumes  of  carbonic  and  sulphurous

more the underfed peasant was nightly exposed and of the result a debilitated and scrofulous people 
there  was  no  want  of  evidence  The  statements  of  the  relieving  officers  of  Carmarthenshire  and

places and where not protected are blown out of all shape The cottages generally crouch under some 
bank or often in a ravine or quarry and none but the smallest sheep and native cattle can live on the 
pastures The young people migrate to the eastern mining districts of Glamorgan and Monmouth

Dr Hunters Report in Public Health Seventh Report  pp  passim 
 In  this law was improved to some extent It will soon be learnt from experience that tinkering 
of this sort is of no use 
  In  order  to  understand  that  which  follows  we  must  remember  that  Close  Villages  are  those 
whose  owners  are  one  or  two  large  landlords  Open  villages  those  whose  soil  belongs  to  many 
smaller landlords It is in the latter that building speculators can build cottages and lodginghouses 
 A showvillage of this kind looks very nice but is as unreal as the villages that Catherine II saw on 
her journey to the Crimea In recent times the shepherd also has often been banished from these show
villages eg near Market Harboro is sheepfarm of about  acres which only employs the labour 
of one man To reduce the long trudges over these wide plains the beautiful pastures of Leicester and 
Northampton the shepherd used to get a cottage on the farm Now they give him a thirteenth shilling a 
week for lodging that he must find far away in an open village 
  The  labourers  houses  in  the  open  villages  which  of  course  are  always  overcrowded  are 
usually in rows built with their backs against the extreme edge of the plot of land which the builder 
could call his and on this account are not allowed light and air except from the front Dr Hunters 
Report l c p  Very often the beerseller or grocer of the village is at the same time the letter of 
its houses In this case the agricultural labourer finds in him a second master besides the farmer He 
must be his customer as well as his tenant The hind with his s a week minus a rent of  a year  
is obliged to buy at the sellers own terms his modicum of tea sugar flour soap candles and beer 
l c p  These open villages form in fact the penal settlements of the English agricultural 
proletariat  Many  of  the  cottages  are  simply  lodginghouses  through  which  all  the  rabble  of  the 
neighbourhood passes The country labourer and his family who had often in a way truly wonderful 
preserved under the foulest conditions a thoroughness and purity of character go in these utterly to 
the  devil  It  is  of  course  the  fashion  amongst  the  aristocratic  shylocks  to  shrug  their  shoulders 
pharisaically at the building speculators the small landlords and the open villages They know well 
enough that their close villages and showvillages are the birthplaces of the open villages and 
could not exist without them The labourers  were it not for the small owners would for by far the

 The heavenborn employment of the hind gives dignity even to his position He is not a slave but 
a soldier of peace and deserves his place in married mens quarters to be provided by the landlord 
who has claimed a power of enforced labour similar to that the country demands of the soldier He no 
more receives marketprice for his work than does the soldier Like the soldier he is caught young 
ignorant knowing only his own trade and his own locality Early marriage and the operation of the 
various  laws  of  settlement  affect  the  one  as  enlistment  and  the  Mutiny  Act  affect  the  other  Dr

  A  similar  movement  is  seen  during  the  last  ten  years  in  France  in  proportion  as  capitalist 
production there takes possession of agriculture it drives the surplus agricultural population into the 
towns Here also we find deterioration in the housing and other conditions at the source of the surplus 
population On the special proltariat foncier to which this system of parcelling out the land has

 Sixth and last Report of the Childrens Employment Commission published at the end of March 
 It deals solely with the agricultural gangsystem 
 Child Emp Comm VI Report Evidence  p  
 Some gangmasters however have worked themselves up to the position of farmers of  acres 
or proprietors of whole rows of houses 
 Half the girls of Ludford have been ruined by going out in gangs l c p    
  They  gangs  have  greatly  increased  of  late  years  In  some  places  they  are  said  to  have  been 
introduced at comparatively late dates in others where gangs  have been known for many years  
more and younger children are employed in them l c p    
 Small farmers never employ gangs It is not on poor land but on land which affords rent of 
from  to  shillings that women and children are employed in the greatest numbers l c pp  
 
 To one of these gentlemen the taste of his rent was so grateful that he indignantly declared to the 
Commission of Inquiry that the whole hubbub was only due to the name of the system If instead of 
gang it were called the Agricultural Juvenile Industrial Selfsupporting Association everything 
would be all right 
 Gang work is cheaper than other work that is why they are employed says a former gangmaster 
l c p    The gangsystem is decidedly the cheapest for the farmer and decidedly the worst 
for the children says a farmer l c p    
  Undoubtedly  much  of  the  work  now  done  by  children  in  gangs  used  to  be  done  by  men  and 
women More men are out of work now where children and women are employed than formerly l 
c p  n  On the other hand the labour question in some agricultural districts particularly the 
arable is becoming so serious in consequence of emigration and the facility afforded by railways for 
getting to large towns that I the I is the steward of a great lord think the services of children are 
most indispensable l c p  n  For the labour question in English agricultural districts 
differently from the rest of the civilised world means the landlords and farmers question viz how 
is  it  possible  despite  an  always  increasing  exodus  of  the  agricultural  folk  to  keep  up  a  sufficient 
relative  surplus  population  in  the  country  and  by  means  of  it  keep  the  wages  of  the  agricultural 
labourer at a minimum 
 The Public Health Report where in dealing with the subject of childrens mortality the gang
system is treated in passing remains unknown to the press and therefore to the English public On 
the other hand the last report of the Child Empl Comm afforded the press sensational copy always 
welcome Whilst the Liberal press asked how the fine gentlemen and ladies and the wellpaid clergy 
of  the  State  Church  with  whom  Lincolnshire  swarms  could  allow  such  a  system  to  arise  on  their 
estates  under  their  very  eyes  they  who  send  out  expressly  missions  to  the  Antipodes  for  the 
improvement  of  the  morals  of  South  Sea  Islanders    the  more  refined  press  confined  itself  to 
reflections on the coarse degradation of the agricultural population who are capable of selling their 
children into such slavery Under the accursed conditions to which these delicate people condemn 
the  agricultural  labourer  it  would  not  be  surprising  if  he  ate  his  own  children  What  is  really 
wonderful  is  the  healthy  integrity  of  character  he  has  in  great  part  retained  The  official  reports 
prove  that  the  parents  even  in  the  gang  districts  loathe  the  gangsystem  There  is  much  in  the 
evidence that shows that the parents of the children would in many instances be glad to be aided by 
the  requirements  of  a  legal  obligation  to  resist  the  pressure  and  the  temptations  to  which  they  are 
often subject They are liable to be urged at times by the parish officers at times by employers under 
threats of being themselves discharged to be taken to work at an age when  school attendance  
would be manifestly to their greater advantage All that time and strength wasted all the suffering

Chapter  The Secret of Primitive 

Accumulation 

We have seen how money is changed into capital how through capital surplusvalue is made and 
from  surplusvalue  more  capital  But  the  accumulation  of  capital  presupposes  surplusvalue 
surplusvalue  presupposes  capitalistic  production  capitalistic  production  presupposes  the  pre
existence  of  considerable  masses  of  capital  and  of  labour  power  in  the  hands  of  producers  of 
commodities The whole movement therefore seems to turn in a vicious circle out of which we 
can  only  get  by  supposing  a  primitive  accumulation  previous  accumulation  of  Adam  Smith 
preceding  capitalistic  accumulation  an  accumulation  not  the  result  of  the  capitalistic  mode  of 
production but its starting point 
This primitive  accumulation  plays in  Political  Economy  about  the same  part  as  original  sin  in 
theology Adam bit the apple and thereupon sin fell on the human race Its origin is supposed to 
be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past In times long gone by there were two sorts 
of  people  one  the  diligent  intelligent  and  above  all  frugal  elite  the  other  lazy  rascals 
spending their substance and more in riotous living The legend of theological original sin tells 
us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow but the 
history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means 
essential  Never  mind  Thus  it  came  to  pass  that  the  former  sort  accumulated  wealth  and  the 
latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins And from this original sin dates the 
poverty of the great majority that despite all its labour has up to now nothing to sell but itself 
and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work Such 
insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property M Thiers eg had 
the  assurance  to  repeat  it  with  all  the  solemnity  of  a  statesman  to  the  French people  once  so 
spirituel But as soon as the question of property crops up it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim 
the  intellectual  food  of  the  infant  as  the  one  thing  fit  for  all  ages  and  for  all  stages  of 
development In actual history it is notorious that conquest enslavement robbery murder briefly 
force play the great part In the tender annals of Political Economy the idyllic reigns from time 
immemorial Right and labour were from all time the sole means of enrichment the present 
year of course always excepted As a matter of fact the methods of primitive accumulation are 
anything but idyllic 
In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and 
of subsistence They want transforming into capital But this transformation itself can only take 
place  under  certain  circumstances  that  centre  in  this  viz  that  two  very  different  kinds  of 
commoditypossessors must come face to face and into contact on the one hand the owners of 
money means of production means of subsistence who are eager to increase the sum of values 
they possess by buying other peoples labour power on the other hand free labourers the sellers 
of their own labour power and therefore the sellers of labour Free labourers in the double sense 
that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production as in the case of 
slaves bondsmen c nor do the means of production belong to them as in the case of peasant
proprietors they are therefore free from unencumbered by any means of production of their 
own  With  this  polarisation  of  the  market  for  commodities  the  fundamental  conditions  of 
capitalist production are given The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the 
labourers  from  all  property  in  the  means  by  which  they  can  realize  their  labour  As  soon  as 
capitalist production is once on its own legs it not only maintains this separation but reproduces 
it on a continually extending scale The process therefore that clears the way for the capitalist 
 

 

Chapter  
 
system can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of 
his  means  of  production  a  process  that  transforms  on  the  one  hand  the  social  means  of 
subsistence  and  of  production  into  capital  on  the  other  the  immediate  producers  into  wage 
labourers  The  socalled  primitive  accumulation  therefore  is  nothing  else  than  the  historical 
process of divorcing the producer from the means of production It appears as primitive because 
it forms the prehistoric stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it 
The economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal 
society The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former 
The immediate producer the labourer could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased 
to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave serf or bondsman of another To become a 
free  seller  of  labour  power  who  carries  his  commodity  wherever  he  finds  a  market  he  must 
further have escaped from the regime of the guilds their rules for apprentices and journeymen 
and the impediments of their labour regulations Hence the historical movement which changes 
the producers into wageworkers appears on the one hand as their emancipation from serfdom 
and from the fetters of the guilds and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians But on 
the other hand these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed 
of all their own means of production and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old 
feudal  arrangements  And  the  history  of  this  their  expropriation  is  written  in  the  annals  of 
mankind in letters of blood and fire 
The industrial capitalists these new potentates had on their part not only to displace the guild 
masters of handicrafts but also the feudal lords the possessors of the sources of wealth In this 
respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against 
feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on 
the  free  development  of  production  and  the  free  exploitation  of  man  by  man  The  chevaliers 
dindustrie however only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of 
events of which they themselves were wholly innocent They have risen by means as vile as those 
by which the Roman freedman once on a time made himself the master of his patronus 
The  starting  point  of  the  development  that  gave  rise  to  the  wage  labourer  as  well  as  to  the 
capitalist was the servitude of the labourer The advance consisted in a change of form of this 
servitude in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation To understand 
its  march  we  need  not  go  back  very  far  Although  we  come  across  the  first  beginnings  of 
capitalist production as early as the th or th century sporadically in certain towns of the 
Mediterranean the capitalistic era dates from the th century Wherever it appears the abolition 
of serfdom has been long effected and the highest development of the middle ages the existence 
of sovereign towns has been long on the wane 
In the history of primitive accumulation all revolutions are epochmaking that act as levers for 
the capital class in course of formation but above all those moments when great masses of men 
are  suddenly  and  forcibly  torn  from  their  means  of  subsistence  and  hurled  as  free  and 
unattached proletarians on the labourmarket The expropriation of the agricultural producer of 
the peasant from the soil is the basis of the whole process The history of this expropriation in 
different  countries  assumes  different  aspects  and  runs  through  its  various  phases  in  different 
orders of succession and at different periods In England alone which we take as our example 
has it the classic form  
                                                      
In Italy where capitalistic production developed earliest the dissolution of serfdom also took place 
earlier  than  elsewhere  The  serf  was  emancipated  in  that  country  before  he  had  acquired  any

century annihilated Northern Italys commercial supremacy a movement in the reverse direction set

Chapter  Expropriation of the Agricultural 

Population From the Land 

In England serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of the th century The immense 
majority of the population consisted then and to a still larger extent in the th century of free 
peasant proprietors whatever was the feudal title under which their right of property was hidden 
In the larger seignorial domains the old bailiff himself a serf was displaced by the free farmer 
The wage labourers of agriculture consisted partly of peasants who utilised their leisure time by 
working on the large estates partly of an independent special class of wage labourers relatively 
and absolutely few in numbers The latter also were practically at the same time peasant farmers 
since besides their wages they had allotted to them arable land to the extent of  or more acres 
together with their cottages Besides they with the rest of the peasants enjoyed the usufruct of 
the common land which gave pasture to their cattle furnished them with timber firewood turf 
c In all countries of Europe feudal production is characterised by division of the soil amongst 
the  greatest  possible  number  of  subfeudatories  The  might  of  the  feudal  lord  like  that  of  the 
sovereign depended not on the length of his rent roll but on the number of his subjects and the 
latter depended on the number of peasant proprietors Although therefore the English land after 
the Norman Conquest was distributed in gigantic baronies one of which often included some 
 of the old AngloSaxon lordships it was bestrewn with small peasant properties only here 
and  there  interspersed  with  great  seignorial  domains  Such  conditions  together  with  the 
prosperity of the towns so characteristic of the th century allowed of that wealth of the people 
which Chancellor Fortescue so eloquently paints in his Laudes legum Angliae but it excluded 
the possibility of capitalistic wealth 
The prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production was 
played  in  the  last  third  of  the  th  and  the  first  decade  of  the  th  century  A  mass  of  free 
proletarians was hurled on the labour market by the breakingup of the bands of feudal retainers 
who as Sir James Steuart well says everywhere uselessly filled house and castle Although the 
royal  power  itself  a  product  of  bourgeois  development  in  its  strife  after  absolute  sovereignty 
forcibly hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers it was by no means the sole cause 
of it In insolent conflict with king and parliament the great feudal lords created an incomparably 
larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land to which the latter had the 
same feudal right as the lord himself and by the usurpation of the common lands The rapid rise 
of the Flemish wool manufactures and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in England 
gave the direct impulse to these evictions The old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal 
wars The new nobility was the child of its time for which money was the power of all powers 
Transformation  of  arable  land  into  sheepwalks  was  therefore  its  cry  Harrison  in  his 
Description of England prefixed to Holinsheds Chronicles describes how the expropriation of 
small peasants is ruining the country What care our great encroachers The dwellings of the 
peasants and the cottages of the labourers were razed to the ground or doomed to decay If says 
Harrison the old records of euerie manour be sought it will soon appear that in some manour 
seventeene eighteene or twentie houses are shrunk that England was neuer less furnished with 
people than at the present Of cities and townes either utterly decaied or more than a quarter or 
half diminished though some one be a little increased here or there of townes pulled downe for 
sheepewalks and no more but the lordships now standing in them I could saie somewhat The 
complaints  of  these  old  chroniclers  are  always  exaggerated  but  they  reflect  faithfully  the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
impression  made  on  contemporaries  by  the  revolution  in  the  conditions  of  production  A 
comparison of the writings of Chancellor Fortescue and Thomas More reveals the gulf between 
the th and th century As Thornton rightly has it the English working class was precipitated 
without any transition from its golden into its iron age 
Legislation was terrified at this revolution It did not yet stand on that height of civilisation where 
the  wealth  of  the  nation  ie  the  formation  of  capital  and  the  reckless  exploitation  and 
impoverishing of the mass of the people figure as the ultima Thule of all statecraft In his history 
of Henry VII Bacon says Inclosures at that time  began to be more frequent whereby 
arable land which could not be manured without people and families was turned into pasture 
which was easily rid by a few herdsmen and tenancies for years lives and at will whereupon 
much of the yeomanry lived were turned into demesnes This bred a decay of people and by 
consequence  a  decay  of  towns  churches  tithes  and  the  like  In  remedying  of  this 
inconvenience the kings wisdom was admirable and the parliaments at that time they took a 
course to take away depopulating enclosures and depopulating pasturage An Act of Henry VII 
 cap  forbad the destruction of all houses of husbandry to which at least  acres of 
land belonged By an Act  Henry VIII the same law was renewed It recites among other 
things that many farms and large flocks of cattle especially of sheep are concentrated in the 
hands of a few men whereby the rent of land has much risen and tillage has fallen off churches 
and houses have been pulled down and marvellous numbers of people have been deprived of the 
means  wherewith  to  maintain  themselves  and  their  families  The  Act  therefore  ordains  the 
rebuilding of the decayed farmsteads and fixes a proportion between corn land and pasture land 
c An Act of  recites that some owners possess  sheep and limits the number to be 
owned to  The cry of the people and the legislation directed for  years after Henry 
VII against the expropriation of the small farmers and peasants were alike fruitless The secret 
of their inefficiency Bacon without knowing it reveals to us The device of King Henry VII 
says Bacon in his Essays Civil and Moral Essay  was profound and admirable in making 
farms and houses of husbandry of a standard that is maintained with such a proportion of land 
unto them as may breed a subject to live in convenient plenty and no servile condition and to 
keep the plough in the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings What the capitalist system 
demanded was on the other hand a degraded and almost servile condition of the mass of the 
people the transformation of them into mercenaries and of their means of labour into capital 
During  this  transformation  period  legislation  also  strove  to  retain  the    acres  of  land  by  the 
cottage of the agricultural wage labourer and forbad him to take lodgers into his cottage In the 
reign of James I  Roger Crocker of Front Mill was condemned for having built a cottage 
on the manor of Front Mill without  acres of land attached to the same in perpetuity As late as 
Charles Is reign  a royal commission was appointed to enforce the carrying out of the old 
laws especially that referring to the  acres of land Even in Cromwells time the building of a 
house within  miles of London was forbidden unless it was endowed with  acres of land As 
late  as  the  first  half  of  the  th  century  complaint  is  made  if  the  cottage  of  the  agricultural 
labourer has not an adjunct of one or two acres of land Nowadays he is lucky if it is furnished 
with a little garden or if he may rent far away from his cottage a few roods Landlords and 
farmers says Dr Hunter work here hand in hand A few acres to the cottage would make the 
labourers too independent  
The  process  of  forcible  expropriation  of  the  people  received  in  the  th  century  a  new  and 
frightful impulse from the Reformation and from the consequent colossal spoliation of the church 
property The Catholic church was at the time of the Reformation feudal proprietor of a great 
part of the English land The suppression of the monasteries c hurled their inmates into the 

 

 

Chapter  
 
proletariat  The  estates  of  the  church  were  to  a  large  extent  given  away  to  rapacious  royal 
favourites  or  sold  at  a  nominal  price  to  speculating  farmers  and  citizens  who  drove  out  en 
masse  the  hereditary  subtenants  and  threw  their  holdings  into  one  The  legally  guaranteed 
property of the poorer folk in a part of the churchs tithes was tacitly confiscated Pauper ubique 
jacet cried Queen Elizabeth after a journey through England In the rd year of her reign the 
nation  was  obliged  to  recognise  pauperism  officially  by  the  introduction  of  a  poorrate  The 
authors  of  this  law  seem  to  have  been  ashamed  to  state  the  grounds  of  it  for  contrary  to 
traditional usage it has no preamble whatever By the th of Charles I ch  it was declared 
perpetual and in fact only in  did it take a new and harsher form These immediate results 
of  the  Reformation  were  not  its  most  lasting  ones  The  property  of  the  church  formed  the 
religious  bulwark  of  the  traditional  conditions  of  landed  property  With  its  fall  these  were  no 
longer tenable  
Even in the last decade of the th century the yeomanry the class of independent peasants were 
more numerous than the class of farmers They had formed the backbone of Cromwells strength 
and even according to the confession of Macaulay stood in favourable contrast to the drunken 
squires  and  to  their  servants  the  country  clergy  who  had  to  marry  their  masters  castoff 
mistresses About  the yeomanry had disappeared and so had in the last decade of the 
th century the last trace of the common land of the agricultural labourer We leave on one side 
here the purely economic causes of the agricultural revolution We deal only with the forcible 
means employed 
After  the  restoration  of  the  Stuarts  the  landed  proprietors  carried  by  legal  means  an  act  of 
usurpation effected everywhere on the Continent without any legal formality They abolished the 
feudal tenure of land ie they got rid of all its obligations to the State indemnified the State 
by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of the mass of the people vindicated for themselves the 
rights of modern private property in estates to which they had only a feudal title and finally 
passed  those  laws  of  settlement  which  mutatis  mutandis  had  the  same  effect  on  the  English 
agricultural labourer as the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunof on the Russian peasantry  
The glorious Revolution brought into power along with William of Orange the landlord and 
capitalist  appropriators  of  surplusvalue  They  inaugurated  the  new  era  by  practising  on  a 
colossal scale thefts of state lands thefts that had been hitherto managed more modestly These 
estates were given away sold at a ridiculous figure or even annexed to private estates by direct 
seizure All this happened without the slightest observation of legal etiquette The Crown lands 
thus fraudulently appropriated together with the robbery of the Church estates as far as these had 
not been lost again during the republican revolution form the basis of the today princely domains 
of the English oligarchy The bourgeois capitalists favoured the operation with the view among 
others  to  promoting  free  trade  in  land to  extending  the  domain  of  modern  agriculture  on the 
large  farmsystem  and  to  increasing  their  supply  of  the  free  agricultural  proletarians  ready  to 
hand  Besides  the  new  landed  aristocracy  was  the  natural  ally  of  the  new  bankocracy  of  the 
newlyhatched  haute  finance  and  of  the  large  manufacturers  then  depending  on  protective 
duties  The  English  bourgeoisie  acted  for  its  own  interest  quite  as  wisely  as  did  the  Swedish 
bourgeoisie who reversing the process hand in hand with their economic allies the peasantry 
helped the kings in the forcible resumption of the Crown lands from the oligarchy This happened 
since  under Charles X and Charles XI  
Communal  property    always  distinct  from  the  State  property  just  dealt  with    was  an  old 
Teutonic  institution  which  lived  on  under  cover  of  feudalism  We  have  seen  how  the  forcible 
usurpation of this generally accompanied by the turning of arable into pasture land begins at the 
end of the th and extends into the th century But at that time the process was carried on by

means  of  individual  acts  of  violence  against  which  legislation  for  a  hundred  and  fifty  years 
fought  in  vain  The  advance  made  by  the  th  century  shows  itself  in  this  that  the  law  itself 
becomes now the instrument of the theft of the peoples land although the large farmers make 
use of their little independent methods as well The parliamentary form of the robbery is that of 
Acts  for  enclosures  of  Commons  in  other  words  decrees  by  which  the  landlords  grant 
themselves the peoples land as private property decrees of expropriation of the people Sir F M 
Eden refutes his own crafty special pleading in which he tries to represent communal property as 
the private property of the great landlords who have taken the place of the feudal lords when he 
himself demands a general Act of Parliament for the enclosure of Commons admitting thereby 
that  a  parliamentary  coup  dtat  is  necessary  for  its  transformation  into  private  property  and 
moreover calls on the legislature for the indemnification for the expropriated poor  
Whilst the place of the independent yeoman was taken by tenants at will small farmers on yearly 
leases a servile rabble dependent on the pleasure of the landlords the systematic robbery of the 
Communal lands helped especially next to the theft of the State domains to swell those large 
farms that were called in the th century capital farms or merchant farms and to set free 
the agricultural population as proletarians for manufacturing industry 
The  th  century  however  did  not  yet  recognise  as  fully  as  the  th  the  identity  between 
national wealth and the poverty of the people Hence the most vigorous polemic in the economic 
literature of that time on the enclosure of commons From the mass of materials that lie before 
me  I  give  a  few  extracts  that  will  throw  a  strong  light  on  the  circumstances  of  the  time  In 
several  parishes  of  Hertfordshire  writes  one  indignant  person    farms  numbering  on  the 
average    acres  have  been  melted  up  into  three  farms  In  Northamptonshire  and 
Leicestershire the enclosure of common lands has taken place on a very large scale and most of 
the new lordships resulting from the enclosure have been turned into pasturage in consequence 
of which many lordships have not now  acres ploughed yearly in which  were ploughed 
formerly  The  ruins  of  former  dwellinghouses  barns  stables  c  are  the  sole  traces  of  the 
former inhabitants An hundred houses and families have in some openfield villages dwindled 
to eight or ten The landholders in most parishes that have been enclosed only  or  years 
are very few in comparison of the numbers who occupied them in their openfield state It is no 
uncommon  thing  for    or    wealthy  graziers  to  engross  a  large  enclosed  lordship  which  was 
before in the hands of  or  farmers and as many smaller tenants and proprietors All these are 
hereby thrown out of their livings with their families and many other families who were chiefly 
employed  and  supported  by  them  It  was  not  only  the  land  that  lay  waste  but  often  land 
cultivated  either  in  common  or  held  under  a  definite  rent  paid  to  the  community  that  was 
annexed  by  the  neighbouring  landlords  under  pretext  of  enclosure  I  have  here  in  view 
enclosures of open fields and lands already improved It is acknowledged by even the writers in 
defence of enclosures that these diminished villages increase the monopolies of farms raise the 
prices of provisions and produce depopulation  and even the enclosure of waste lands as now 
carried on bears hard on the poor by depriving them of a part of their subsistence and only goes 
towards increasing farms already too large When says Dr Price this land gets into the 
hands of a few great farmers the consequence must be that the little farmers earlier designated 
by him a multitude of little proprietors and tenants who maintain themselves and families by the 
produce of the ground they occupy by sheep kept on a common by poultry hogs c and who 
therefore have little occasion to purchase any of the means of subsistence will be converted 
into a body of men who earn their subsistence by working for others and who will be under a 
necessity of going to market for all they want There will perhaps be more labour because 
there will be more compulsion to it Towns and manufactures will increase because more will

be driven to them in quest of places and employment This is the way in which the engrossing of 
farms  naturally  operates  And  this  is  the  way  in  which  for  many  years  it  has  been  actually 
operating in this kingdom He sums up the effect of the enclosures thus Upon the whole the 
circumstances of the lower ranks of men are altered in almost every respect for the worse From 
little occupiers of land they are reduced to the state of daylabourers and hirelings and at the 
same time their subsistence in that state has become more difficult In fact usurpation of the 
common  lands  and  the  revolution  in  agriculture  accompanying  this  told  so  acutely  on  the 
agricultural labourers that even according to Eden between  and  their wages began to 
fall  below  the  minimum  and  to  be  supplemented  by  official  poorlaw  relief  Their  wages  he 
says were not more than enough for the absolute necessaries of life  
Let us hear for a moment a defender of enclosures and an opponent of Dr Price Not is it a 
consequence that there must be depopulation because men are not seen wasting their labour in 
the open field If by converting the little farmers into a body of men who must work for others 
more  labour  is  produced  it  is  an  advantage  which  the  nation  to  which  of  course  the 
converted ones do not belong should wish for  the produce being greater when their joint 
labours are employed on one farm there will be a surplus for manufactures and by this means 
manufactures one of the mines of the nation will increase in proportion to the quantity of corn 
produced  
The  stoical  peace  of  mind  with  which  the  political  economist  regards  the  most  shameless 
violation of the sacred rights of property and the grossest acts of violence to persons as soon as 
they are necessary to lay the foundations of the capitalistic mode of production is shown by Sir 
F  M  Eden philanthropist  and  tory  to  boot The  whole  series  of  thefts  outrages  and popular 
misery that accompanied the forcible expropriation of the people from the last third of the th 
to  the  end  of  the  th  century  lead  him  merely  to  the  comfortable  conclusion  The  due 
proportion between arable land and pasture had to be established During the whole of the th 
and the greater part of the th century there was one acre of pasture to   and even  of arable 
land About the middle of the th century the proportion was changed of  acres of pasture to  
later on of  acres of pasture to one of arable until at last the just proportion of  acres of pasture 
to one of arable land was attained  
In the th century the very memory of the connexion between the agricultural labourer and the 
communal  property  had  of  course  vanished  To  say  nothing  of  more  recent  times  have  the 
agricultural population received a farthing of compensation for the  acres of common 
land  which  between    and    were  stolen  from  them  and  by  parliamentary  devices 
presented to the landlords by the landlords 
The last process of wholesale expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil is finally 
the socalled clearing of estates ie the sweeping men off them All the English methods hitherto 
considered culminated in clearing As we saw in the picture of modern conditions given in a 
former  chapter  where  there  are  no  more  independent  peasants  to  get  rid  of  the  clearing  of 
cottages begins so that the agricultural labourers do not find on the soil cultivated by them even 
the  spot  necessary  for  their  own  housing  But  what  clearing  of  estates  really  and  properly 
signifies  we  learn  only  in  the  promised  land  of  modern  romance  the  Highlands  of  Scotland 
There the process is distinguished by its systematic character by the magnitude of the scale on 
which it is carried out at one blow in Ireland landlords have gone to the length of sweeping away 
several villages at once in Scotland areas as large as German principalities are dealt with finally 
by the peculiar form of property under which the embezzled lands were held  
The Highland Celts were organised in clans each of which was the owner of the land on which it 
was settled The representative of the clan its chief or great man was only the titular owner of 
 

 

Chapter  
 
this property just as the Queen of England is the titular owner of all the national soil When the 
English government succeeded in suppressing the intestine wars of these great men and their 
constant incursions into the Lowland plains the chiefs of the clans by no means gave up their 
timehonoured  trade  as  robbers  they  only  changed  its  form  On  their  own  authority  they 
transformed  their  nominal right  into  a  right  of  private  property  and  as  this  brought  them  into 
collision with their clansmen resolved to drive them out by open force A king of England might 
as well claim to drive his subjects into the sea says Professor Newman This revolution which 
began in Scotland after the last rising of the followers of the Pretender can be followed through 
its first phases in the writings of Sir James Steuart  and James Anderson In the th century 
the huntedout Gaels were forbidden to emigrate from the country with a view to driving them by 
force to Glasgow and other manufacturing towns As an example of the method  obtaining in 
the th century the clearing made by the Duchess of Sutherland will suffice here This person 
well instructed in economy resolved on entering upon her government to effect a radical cure 
and to turn the whole country whose population had already been by earlier processes of the like 
kind reduced to  into a sheepwalk From  to  these  inhabitants about 
 families were systematically hunted and rooted out All their villages were destroyed and 
burnt all their fields turned into pasturage British soldiers enforced this eviction and came to 
blows with the inhabitants One old woman was burnt to death in the flames of the hut which she 
refused  to  leave  Thus  this  fine  lady  appropriated    acres  of  land  that  had  from  time 
immemorial belonged to the clan She assigned to the expelled inhabitants about  acres on 
the seashore   acres per family The  acres had until this time lain waste and brought in 
no income to their owners The Duchess in the nobility of her heart actually went so far as to let 
these at an average rent of s d per acre to the clansmen who for centuries had shed their blood 
for  her  family  The  whole  of  the  stolen  clanland  she  divided  into    great  sheep  farms  each 
inhabited by a single family for the most part imported English farmservants In the year  
the  Gaels were already replaced by  sheep The remnant of the aborigines flung on 
the seashore tried to live by catching fish They became amphibious and lived as an English 
author says half on land and half on water and withal only half on both  
But the brave Gaels must expiate yet more bitterly their idolatry romantic and of the mountains 
for the great men of the clan The smell of their fish rose to the noses of the great men They 
scented some profit in it and let the seashore to the great fishmongers of London For the second 
time the Gaels were hunted out  
But finally part of the sheepwalks are turned into deer preserves Every one knows that there 
are no real forests in England The deer in the parks of the great are demurely domestic cattle fat 
as  London  aldermen  Scotland  is  therefore  the  last  refuge  of  the  noble  passion  In  the 
Highlands says Somers in  new forests are springing up like mushrooms Here on one 
side of Gaick you have the new forest of Glenfeshie and there on the other you have the new 
forest of Ardverikie In the same line you have the Black Mount an immense waste also recently 
erected From east to west  from the neighbourhood of Aberdeen to the crags of Oban  you 
have now a continuous line of forests while in other parts of the Highlands there are the new 
forests of Loch Archaig Glengarry Glenmoriston c Sheep were introduced into glens which 
had been the seats of communities of small farmers and the latter were driven to seek subsistence 
on coarser and more sterile tracks of soil Now deer are supplanting sheep and these are once 
more dispossessing the small tenants who will necessarily be driven down upon still coarser land 
and to more grinding penury Deerforests and the people cannot coexist One or other of the 
two must yield Let the forests be increased in number and extent during the next quarter of a 
century  as  they  have  been  in  the  last  and  the  Gaels  will  perish  from  their  native  soil  This

movement among the Highland proprietors is with some a matter of ambition with some love of 
sport while others of a more practical cast follow the trade in deer with an eye solely to profit 
For it is a fact that a mountain range laid out in forest is in many cases more profitable to the 
proprietor  than  when let  as  a sheepwalk    The  huntsman  who  wants a  deerforest  limits  his 
offers by no other calculation than the extent of his purse Sufferings have been inflicted in the 
Highlands scarcely less severe than those occasioned by the policy of the Norman kings Deer 
have received extended ranges while men have been hunted within a narrower and still narrower 
circle One after one the liberties of the people have been cloven down And the oppressions 
are  daily  on  the  increase  The  clearance  and  dispersion  of  the  people  is  pursued  by  the 
proprietors  as  a  settled  principle  as  an  agricultural  necessity  just  as  trees  and  brushwood  are 
cleared from the wastes of America or Australia and the operation goes on in a quiet business
like way c  
The  spoliation  of  the  churchs  property  the  fraudulent  alienation  of  the  State  domains  the 
robbery of the common lands the usurpation of feudal and clan property and its transformation 
into modern private property under circumstances of reckless terrorism were just so many idyllic 
methods of primitive accumulation They conquered the field for capitalistic agriculture made the 
soil part and parcel of capital and created for the town industries the necessary supply of a free 
and outlawed proletariat 
                                                      
 The petty proprietors who cultivated their own fields with their own hands and enjoyed a modest 
competence then formed a much more important part of the nation than at present If we may trust 
the best statistical writers of that age not less than  proprietors who with their families must 
have  made  up  more  than  a  seventh  of  the  whole  population  derived  their  subsistence  from  little 
freehold estates The average income of these small landlords was estimated at between  and  
a year It was computed that the number of persons who tilled their own land was greater than the 
number of those who farmed the land of others Macaulay History of England th ed  I

 The spirit of Protestantism may be seen from the following among other things In the south of 
England certain landed proprietors and welltodo farmers put their heads together and propounded ten 
questions as to the right interpretation of the poorlaw of Elizabeth These they laid before a celebrated 
jurist of that time Sergeant Snigge later a judge under James I for his opinion Question   Some 
of the  more wealthy farmers in the parish have devised a skilful  mode by which all the trouble of 
executing this Act the rd of Elizabeth might be avoided They have proposed that we shall erect a 
prison in the parish and then give notice to the neighbourhood that if any persons are disposed to 
farm the poor of this parish they do give in sealed proposals on a certain day of the lowest price at 
which they will take them off our hands and that they will be authorised to refuse to any one unless 
he be shut up in the aforesaid prison The proposers of this plan conceive that there will be found in 
the adjoining counties persons who being unwilling to labour and not possessing substance or credit 
to take a farm or ship so as to live without labour may be induced to make a very advantageous offer 
to the parish If any of the poor perish under the contractors care the sin will lie at his door as the 
parish will have done its duty by them We are however apprehensive that the present Act rd of 
Elizabeth will not warrant a prudential measure of this kind but you are to learn that the rest of the 
freeholders of the county and of the adjoining county of B will very readily join in instructing their 
members to propose an Act to enable the parish to contract with a person to lock up and work the 
poor and to declare that if any person shall refuse to be so locked up and worked he shall be entitled 
to no relief This it is hoped will prevent persons in distress from wanting relief and be the means of 
keeping down parishes R Blakey The History of Political  Literature from the  Earliest Times

 Price l c p  We are reminded of ancient Rome The rich had got possession of the greater 
part of the undivided land They trusted in the conditions of the time that these possessions would not 
be again taken from them  and bought therefore some of the pieces of land lying near theirs and 
belonging to the poor with the acquiescence of their owners and took some by force so that they now 
were cultivating widely extended domains instead of isolated fields Then they employed slaves in 
agriculture  and  cattlebreeding  because  freemen  would  have  been  taken  from  labour  for  military 
service  The  possession  of  slaves  brought  them  great  gain  inasmuch  as  these  on  account  of  their 
immunity  from  military  service  could  freely  multiply  and  have  a  multitude  of  children  Thus  the 
powerful men drew all wealth to themselves and all the land swarmed with slaves The Italians on 
the  other  hand  were  always  decreasing  in  number  destroyed  as  they  were  by  poverty  taxes  and

without his spinningwheel it offers him a last resort while providing useful occupation for his wife 
his children his maids his farmhands and himself but what a painful life he leads even with this 
extra resource In summer he works like a convict with the plough and at harvest he goes to bed at 
nine  oclock  and  rises  at  two  to  get  through  all  his  work  in  winter  he  ought  to  be  recovering  his 
strength by sleeping longer but he would run short of corn for his bread and next years sowing if he 
got rid of the products that he needs to sell in order to pay the taxes He therefore has to spin to fill up 
this gap  and indeed he must do so most assiduously Thus the peasant goes to bed at midnight or 
one oclock in winter and gets up at five or six or he goes to bed at nine and gets up at two and this 
he does every day of his life except Sundays These excessively short hours of sleep and long hours of 
work consume a persons strength and hence it happens that men and women age much more in the 
country than in the towns Mirabeau l c tIII pp  sqq 
Note to the second edition In April   years after the publication of the work of Robert Somers 
quoted above Professor Leone Levi gave a lecture before the Society of Arts on the transformation of 
sheepwalks  into  deerforest  in  which  he  depicts  the  advance  in  the  devastation  of  the  Scottish 
Highlands He says with other things Depopulation and transformation into sheepwalks were the 
most convenient means for getting an income without expenditure A deerforest in place of a sheep
walk  was  a  common  change  in  the  Highlands  The  landowners  turned  out  the  sheep  as  they  once 
turned  out  the  men  from  their  estates  and  welcomed  the  new  tenants    the  wild  beasts  and  the 
feathered birds One can walk from the Earl of Dalhousies estates in Forfarshire to John OGroats 
without  ever  leaving  forest  land  In  many  of  these  woods  the  fox  the  wild  cat  the  marten  the 
polecat the weasel and the Alpine hare are common whilst the rabbit the squirrel and the rat have 
lately  made  their  way  into  the  country  Immense  tracts  of  land  much  of  which  is described  in  the 
statistical  account  of  Scotland  as  having  a  pasturage  in  richness  and  extent  of  very  superior 
description are thus shut out from all cultivation and improvement and are solely devoted to the sport 
of a few persons for a very brief period of the year The London Economist of June   says 
Amongst the items of news in a Scotch paper of last week we read One of the finest sheep farms 
in Sutherlandshire for which a rent of  a year was recently offered on the expiry of the existing 
lease this year is to be converted into a deerforest Here we see the modern instincts of feudalism  
operating pretty much as they did when the Norman Conqueror destroyed  villages to create the 
New Forest Two millions of acres totally laid waste embracing within their area some of the most 
fertile lands of Scotland The natural grass of Glen Tilt was among the most nutritive in the county of 
Perth  The  deerforest  of  Ben  Aulder  was  by  far  the  best  grazing  ground  in  the  wide  district  of 
Badenoch a part of the Black Mount forest was the best pasture for blackfaced sheep in Scotland 
Some idea of the ground laid waste for purely sporting purposes in Scotland may be formed from the 
fact that it embraced an area larger than the whole county of Perth The resources of the forest of Ben 
Aulder  might  give  some  idea  of  the  loss  sustained  from  the  forced  desolations  The  ground  would 
pasture    sheep  and  as  it  was  not  more  than  onethirtieth  part  of  the  old  forest  ground  in 
Scotland  it might c  All that forest land is as totally unproductive It might thus as well have 
been submerged under the waters of the German Ocean Such extemporised wildernesses or deserts 
ought to be put down by the decided interference of the Legislature  

 

 

Chapter  Bloody Legislation Against the 

Expropriated from the End of the th Century 

Forcing Down of Wages by Acts of Parliament 

The proletariat created by the breaking up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible 
expropriation of the people from the soil this free proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by 
the nascent manufactures as fast as it was thrown upon the world On the other hand these men 
suddenly dragged from their wonted mode of life could not as suddenly adapt themselves to the 
discipline of their new condition They were turned en masse into beggars robbers vagabonds 
partly from inclination in most cases from stress of circumstances Hence at the end of the th 
and during the whole of the th century throughout Western Europe a bloody legislation against 
vagabondage  The  fathers  of  the  present  working  class  were  chastised  for  their  enforced 
transformation  into  vagabonds  and  paupers  Legislation  treated  them  as  voluntary  criminals 
and assumed that it depended on their own good will to go on working under the old conditions 
that no longer existed 
In England this legislation began under Henry VII 
Henry VIII  Beggars old and unable to work receive a beggars licence On the other hand 
whipping and imprisonment for sturdy vagabonds They are to be tied to the carttail and whipped 
until the blood streams from their bodies then to swear an oath to go back to their birthplace or to 
where they have lived the last three years and to put themselves to labour What grim irony In 
 Henry VIII the former statute is repeated but strengthened with new clauses For the second 
arrest for vagabondage the whipping is to be repeated and half the ear sliced off but for the third 
relapse the offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and enemy of the common weal 
Edward VI A statute of the first year of his reign  ordains that if anyone refuses to work 
he shall be condemned as a slave to the person who has denounced him as an idler The master 
shall feed his slave on bread and water weak broth and such refuse meat as he thinks fit He has 
the right to force him to do any work no matter how disgusting with whip and chains If the 
slave is absent a fortnight he is condemned to slavery for life and is to be branded on forehead or 
back with the letter S if he runs away thrice he is to be executed as a felon The master can sell 
him bequeath him let him out on hire as a slave just as any other personal chattel or cattle If the 
slaves attempt anything against the masters they are also to be executed Justices of the peace on 
information are to hunt the rascals down If it happens that a vagabond has been idling about for 
three days he is to be taken to his birthplace branded with a redhot iron with the letter V on the 
breast and be set to work in chains in the streets or at some other labour If the vagabond gives a 
false  birthplace  he  is  then  to  become  the  slave  for  life  of  this  place  of  its  inhabitants  or  its 
corporation and to be branded with an S All persons have the right to take away the children of 
the vagabonds and to keep them as apprentices the young men until the th year the girls until 
the th If they run away they are to become up to this age the slaves of their masters who can 
put them in irons whip them c if they like Every master may put an iron ring round the neck 
arms or legs of his slave by which to know him more easily and to be more certain of him  The 
last  part  of  this  statute  provides  that  certain  poor  people  may  be  employed  by  a  place  or  by 
persons who are willing to give them food and drink and to find them work This kind of parish 
slaves was kept up in England until far into the th century under the name of roundsmen  

 

 

Chapter  
 
Elizabeth    Unlicensed  beggars  above    years  of  age  are  to  be  severely  flogged  and 
branded on the left ear unless some one will take them into service for two years in case of a 
repetition of the offence if they are over  they are to be executed unless some one will take 
them into service for two years but for the third offence they are to be executed without mercy as 
felons Similar statutes  Elizabeth c  and another of   
James  Any one wandering about and begging is declared a rogue and a vagabond Justices of 
the peace in petty sessions are authorised to have them publicly whipped and for the first offence 
to imprison them for  months for the second for  years Whilst in prison they are to be whipped 
as much and as often as the justices of the peace think fit Incorrigible and dangerous rogues are 
to be branded with an R on the left shoulder and set to hard labour and if they are caught begging 
again to be executed without mercy These statutes legally binding until the beginning of the 
th century were only repealed by  Anne c  
Similar  laws  in  France  where  by  the  middle  of  the  th  century  a  kingdom  of  vagabonds 
truands was established in Paris Even at the beginning of Louis XVIs reign Ordinance of 
July  th    every  man  in  good  health  from    to    years  of  age  if  without  means  of 
subsistence  and  not  practising  a  trade is to  be  sent  to  the  galleys  Of the same  nature  are the 
statute of Charles V for the Netherlands October  the first edict of the States and Towns 
of Holland March   the Plakaat of the United Provinces June   c 
Thus  were  the  agricultural  people  first  forcibly  expropriated  from  the  soil  driven  from  their 
homes turned into vagabonds and then whipped branded tortured by laws grotesquely terrible 
into the discipline necessary for the wage system 
It is not enough that the conditions of labour are concentrated in a mass in the shape of capital at 
the one pole of society while at the other are grouped masses of men who have nothing to sell 
but their labourpower  Neither is it  enough  that they  are  compelled to sell it voluntarily  The 
advance of capitalist production develops a working class which by education tradition habit 
looks  upon  the  conditions  of  that  mode  of  production  as  selfevident  laws  of  Nature  The 
organisation  of  the  capitalist  process  of  production  once  fully  developed  breaks  down  all 
resistance The constant generation of a relative surpluspopulation keeps the law of supply and 
demand of labour and therefore keeps wages in a rut that corresponds with the wants of capital 
The  dull  compulsion  of  economic  relations  completes  the  subjection  of  the  labourer  to  the 
capitalist  Direct  force  outside  economic  conditions  is  of  course  still  used  but  only 
exceptionally  In  the  ordinary  run  of  things  the  labourer  can  be  left  to  the  natural  laws  of 
production ie to his dependence on capital a dependence springing from and guaranteed in 
perpetuity by the conditions of production themselves It is otherwise during the historic genesis 
of  capitalist  production  The  bourgeoisie  at  its  rise  wants  and  uses  the  power  of  the  state  to 
regulate  wages  ie  to  force  them  within  the  limits  suitable  for  surplusvalue  making  to 
lengthen the working day and to keep the labourer himself in the normal degree of dependence 
This is an essential element of the socalled primitive accumulation 
The class of wage labourers which arose in the latter half of the th century formed then and in 
the following century only a very small part of the population well protected in its position by the 
independent peasant proprietary in the country and the guildorganisation in the town In country 
and  town  master  and  workmen  stood  close  together  socially  The  subordination  of  labour  to 
capital was only formal  ie the mode of production itself had as yet no specific capitalistic 
character  Variable  capital  preponderated  greatly  over  constant  The  demand  for  wage  labour 
grew  therefore  rapidly  with  every  accumulation  of  capital  whilst  the  supply  of  wage  labour 
followed but slowly A large part of the national product changed later into a fund of capitalist 
accumulation then still entered into the consumptionfund of the labourer  
 

 

Chapter  
 
Legislation on wage labour from the first aimed at the exploitation of the labourer and as it 
advanced always equally hostile to him is started in England by the Statute of Labourers of 
Edward  III    The  ordinance  of    in  France  issued  in  the  name  of  King  John 
corresponds with it English and French legislation run parallel and are identical in purport So far 
as the labourstatutes aim at compulsory extension of the working day I do not return to them as 
this point was treated earlier Chap X Section   
The Statute of Labourers was passed at the urgent instance of the House of Commons A Tory 
says naively 

Formerly the poor demanded such high wages as to threaten industry and wealth 
Next their wages are so low as to threaten industry and wealth equally and 
perhaps more but in another way A tariff of wages was fixed by law for town 
and country for piecework and daywork The agricultural labourers were to hire 
themselves out by the year the town ones in open market It was forbidden 
under pain of imprisonment to pay higher wages than those fixed by the statute 
but the taking of higher wages was more severely punished than the giving them 
So also in Sections  and  of the Statute of Apprentices of Elizabeth ten 
days imprisonment is decreed for him that pays the higher wages but twentyone 
days for him that receives them A statute of  increased the penalties and 
authorised the masters to extort labour at the legal rate of wages by corporal 
punishment All combinations contracts oaths c by which masons and 
carpenters reciprocally bound themselves were declared null and void Coalition 
of the labourers is treated as a heinous crime from the th century to  the 
year of the repeal of the laws against Trades Unions The spirit of the Statute of 
Labourers of  and of its offshoots comes out clearly in the fact that indeed a 
maximum of wages is dictated by the State but on no account a minimum  

In the th century the condition of the labourers had as we know become much worse The 
money wage rose but not in proportion to the depreciation of money and the corresponding rise 
in the prices of commodities Wages therefore in reality fell Nevertheless the laws for keeping 
them down remained in force together with the earclipping and branding of those whom no one 
was willing to take into service By the Statute of Apprentices  Elizabeth c  the justices of 
the peace were empowered to fix certain wages and to modify them according to the time of the 
year and the price of commodities James I extended these regulations of labour also to weavers 
spinners and all possible categories of workers George II extended the laws against coalitions 
of labourers to manufactures In the manufacturing period par excellence the capitalist mode of 
production had become sufficiently strong to render legal regulation of wages as impracticable as 
it was unnecessary but the ruling classes were unwilling in case of necessity to be without the 
weapons  of  the  old  arsenal  Still    George  II  forbade  a  higher  days  wage  than  s  d  for 
journeymen tailors in and around London except in cases of general mourning still  George 
III c  gave the regulation of the wages of silkweavers to the justices of the peace still in 
 it required two judgments of the higher courts to decide whether the mandates of justices 
of the peace as to wages held good also for nonagricultural labourers still in  an act of 
Parliament  ordered  that  the  wages  of  the  Scotch  miners  should  continue  to  be  regulated  by  a 
statute  of  Elizabeth  and  two  Scotch  acts  of    and    How  completely  in  the  meantime 
circumstances had changed is proved by an occurrence unheardof before in the English Lower 
House  In  that  place  where  for  more  than    years  laws  had  been  made  for  the  maximum 
beyond  which  wages  absolutely  must  not  rise  Whitbread  in    proposed  a  legal  minimum 
wage for agricultural labourers Pitt opposed this but confessed that the condition of the poor 

 

 

Chapter  
 
was cruel Finally in  the laws for the regulation of wages were repealed They were an 
absurd anomaly since the capitalist regulated his factory by his private legislation and could by 
the poorrates make up the wage of the agricultural labourer to the indispensable minimum The 
provisions of the labour statutes as to contracts between master and workman as to giving notice 
and the like which only allow of a civil action against the contractbreaking master but on the 
contrary permit a criminal action against the contractbreaking workman are to this hour  
in  full  force  The  barbarous  laws  against  Trades  Unions  fell  in    before  the  threatening 
bearing of the proletariat Despite this they fell only in part Certain beautiful fragments of the 
old  statute  vanished  only  in    Finally  the  act  of  Parliament  of  June      made  a 
pretence of removing the last traces of this class of legislation by legal recognition of Trades 
Unions But an act of Parliament of the same date an act to amend the criminal law relating to 
violence threats and molestation reestablished in point of fact the former state of things in a 
new shape By this Parliamentary escamotage the means which the labourers could use in a strike 
or lockout were withdrawn from the laws common to all citizens and placed under exceptional 
penal legislation the interpretation of which fell to the masters themselves in their capacity as 
justices  of  the  peace  Two  years  earlier  the  same  House  of  Commons  and  the  same  Mr 
Gladstone  in  the  wellknown  straightforward  fashion  brought  in  a  bill  for  the  abolition  of  all 
exceptional penal legislation against the working class But this was never allowed to go beyond 
the second reading and the matter was thus protracted until at last the great Liberal party by an 
alliance with the Tories found courage to turn against the very proletariat that had carried it into 
power Not content with this treachery the great Liberal party allowed the English judges ever 
complaisant  in  the  service  of  the  ruling  classes  to  dig  up  again  the  earlier  laws  against 
conspiracy and to apply them to coalitions of labourers We see that only against its will and 
under the pressure of the masses did the English Parliament give up the laws against Strikes and 
Trades Unions after it had itself for  years held with shameless egoism the position of a 
permanent Trades Union of the capitalists against the labourers  
During the very first storms of the revolution the French bourgeoisie dared to take away from the 
workers the right of association but just acquired By a decree of June   they declared all 
coalition of the workers as an attempt against liberty and the declaration of the rights of man 
punishable by a fine of  livres together with deprivation of the rights of an active citizen for 
one year This law which by means of State compulsion confined the struggle between capital 
and  labour  within  limits  comfortable  for  capital  has  outlived  revolutions  and  changes  of 
dynasties Even the Reign of Terror left it untouched It was but quite recently struck out of the 
Penal  Code  Nothing  is  more  characteristic  than  the  pretext  for  this  bourgeois  coup  dtat 
Granting says Chapelier the reporter of the Select Committee on this law that wages ought to 
be a little higher than they are  that they ought to be high enough for him that receives them to 
be  free  from  that  state  of  absolute  dependence  due  to  the  want  of  the  necessaries  of  life  and 
which  is  almost  that  of  slavery  yet  the  workers  must  not  be  allowed  to  come  to  any 
understanding about their own interests nor to act in common and thereby lessen their absolute 
dependence which is almost that of slavery because forsooth in doing this they injure the 
freedom of their cidevant masters the present entrepreneurs and because a coalition against the 
despotism of the quondam masters of the corporations is  guess what  is a restoration of the 
corporations abolished by the French constitution  
                                                      
 The author of the Essay on Trade etc  says In the reign of Edward VI indeed the English 
seem to have set in good earnest about encouraging manufactures and employing the poor This we 
learn from a remarkable statute which runs thus That all vagrants shall be branded c l c p

Chapter  Genesis of the Capitalist Farmer 

Now that we have considered the forcible creation of a class of outlawed proletarians the bloody 
discipline  that  turned  them  into  wage  labourers  the  disgraceful  action  of  the  State  which 
employed  the  police  to  accelerate  the  accumulation  of  capital  by  increasing  the  degree  of 
exploitation  of  labour  the  question  remains  whence  came  the  capitalists  originally  For  the 
expropriation  of  the  agricultural  population  creates  directly  none  but  the  greatest  landed 
proprietors As far however as concerns the genesis of the farmer we can so to say put our 
hand on it because it is a slow process evolving through many centuries The serfs as well as the 
free  small  proprietors  held  land  under  very  different  tenures  and  were  therefore  emancipated 
under very different economic conditions In England the first form of the farmer is the bailiff 
himself a serf His position is similar to that of the old Roman villicus only in a more limited 
sphere of action During the second half of the th century he is replaced by a farmer whom the 
landlord provided with seed cattle and implements His condition is not very different from that 
of the peasant Only he exploits more wage labour Soon he becomes a metayer a halffarmer He 
advances  one  part  of  the  agricultural  stock  the  landlord  the  other  The  two  divide  the  total 
product in proportions determined by contract This form quickly disappears in England to give 
the place to the farmer proper who makes his own capital breed by employing wage labourers 
and  pays  a  part  of  the  surplusproduct  in  money  or  in  kind  to  the  landlord  as  rent  So  long 
during the th century as the independent peasant and the farmlabourer working for himself as 
well as for wages enriched themselves by their own labour the circumstances of the farmer and 
his field of production were equally mediocre The agricultural revolution which commenced in 
the last third of the th century and continued during almost the whole of the th excepting 
however  its  last  decade  enriched  him  just  as  speedily  as  it  impoverished  the  mass  of  the 
agricultural people  
The usurpation of the common lands allowed him to augment greatly his stock of cattle almost 
without cost whilst they yielded him a richer supply of manure for the tillage of the soil To this 
was added in the th century a very important element At that time the contracts for farms ran 
for a long time often for  years The progressive fall in the value of the precious metals and 
therefore  of  money  brought  the  farmers  golden  fruit  Apart  from  all  the  other  circumstances 
discussed above it lowered wages A portion of the latter was now added to the profits of the 
farm The continuous rise in the price of corn wool meat in a word of all agricultural produce 
swelled  the  money  capital  of  the  farm  without  any  action  on  his  part  whilst  the  rent  he  paid 
being calculated on the old value of money diminished in reality Thus they grew rich at the

Chapter  Reaction of the Agricultural 

Revolution on Industry Creation of the Home

Market for Industrial Capital 

The  expropriation  and expulsion  of  the  agricultural population intermittent but  renewed  again 
and  again  supplied  as  we  saw  the  town  industries  with  a  mass  of  proletarians  entirely 
unconnected  with  the  corporate  guilds  and  unfettered  by  them  a  fortunate  circumstance  that 
makes  old  A  Anderson  not  to  be  confounded  with  James  Anderson  in  his  History  of 
Commerce believe in the direct intervention of Providence We must still pause a moment on 
this  element  of  primitive  accumulation  The  thinningout  of  the  independent  selfsupporting 
peasants not only brought about the crowding together of the industrial proletariat in the way that 
Geoffrey  Saint  Hilaire  explained  the  condensation  of  cosmical  matter  at  one  place  by  its 
rarefaction at another In spite of the smaller number of its cultivators the soil brought forth as 
much  or  more  produce  after  as  before  because  the  revolution  in  the  conditions  of  landed 
property was accompanied by improved methods of culture greater cooperation concentration 
of the means of production c and because not only were the agricultural wage labourers put 
on the strain more intensely but the field of production on which they worked for themselves 
became more and more contracted With the setting free of a part of the agricultural population 
therefore their former means of nourishment were also set free They were now transformed into 
material elements of variable capital The peasant expropriated and cast adrift must buy their 
value in the form of wages from his new master the industrial capitalist That which holds good 
of  the  means  of  subsistence  holds  with  the  raw  materials  of  industry  dependent  upon  home 
agriculture They were transformed into an element of constant capital Suppose eg a part of 
the Westphalian peasants who at the time of Frederick II all span flax forcibly expropriated and 
hunted from the soil and the other part that remained turned into day labourers of large farmers 
At the same time arise large establishments for flaxspinning and weaving in which the men set 
free now work for wages The flax looks exactly as before Not a fibre of it is changed but a 
new social soul has popped into its body It forms now a part of the constant capital of the master 
manufacturer  Formerly  divided  among  a  number  of  small  producers  who  cultivated  it 
themselves and with their families spun it in retail fashion it is now concentrated in the hand of 
one capitalist who sets others to spin and weave it for him The extra labour expended in flax
spinning  realised  itself  formerly  in  extra  income  to  numerous  peasant  families  or  maybe  in 
Frederick  IIs  time  in  taxes  pour  le  roi  de  Prusse  It  realises  itself  now  in  profit  for  a  few 
capitalists  The  spindles  and  looms  formerly  scattered  over  the  face  of  the  country  are  now 
crowded together in a few great labourbarracks together with the labourers and the raw material 
And spindles looms raw material are now transformed from means of independent existence for 
the  spinners  and  weavers  into  means  for  commanding  them  and  sucking  out  of  them  unpaid 
labour One does not perceive when looking at the large manufactories and the large farms that 
they have originated from the throwing into one of many small centres of production and have 
been  built  up  by  the  expropriation  of  many  small  independent  producers  Nevertheless  the 
popular intuition was not at fault In the time of Mirabeau the lion of the Revolution the great 
manufactories were still called manufactures runies workshops thrown into one as we speak of 
fields thrown into one Says Mirabeau 

We are only paying attention to the grand manufactories in which hundreds of 
men work under a director and which are commonly called manufactures runies 

 

 

 

Chapter  

Those where a very large number of labourers work each separately and on his 
own account are hardly considered they are placed at an infinite distance from 
the others This is a great error as the latter alone make a really important object 
of national prosperity The large workshop manufacture runie will enrich 
prodigiously one or two entrepreneurs but the labourers will only be journeymen 
paid more or less and will not have any share in the success of the undertaking In 
the discrete workshop manufacture separe on the contrary no one will become 
rich but many labourers will be comfortable the saving and the industrious will 
be able to amass a little capital to put by a little for a birth of a child for an 
illness for themselves or their belongings The number of saving and industrious 
labourers will increase because they will see in good conduct in activity a means 
of essentially bettering their condition and not of obtaining a small rise in wages 
that can never be of any importance of the future and whose sole result is to place 
men in the position to live a little better but only from day to day The large 
workshops undertakings of certain private persons who pay labourers from day to 
day to work for their gain may be able to put these private individuals at their 
ease but they will never be an object worth the attention of governments Discrete 
workshops for the most part combined with cultivation of small holdings are the 
only free ones The expropriation and eviction of a part of the agricultural 
population not only set free for industrial capital the labourers their means of 
subsistence and material for labour it also created the homemarket  

In fact the events that transformed the small peasants into wage labourers and their means of 
subsistence and of labour into material elements of capital created at the same time a home
market for the latter Formerly the peasant family produced the means of subsistence and the raw 
materials which they themselves for the most part consumed These raw materials and means of 
subsistence have now become commodities the large farmer sells them he finds his market in 
manufactures Yarn linen coarse woollen stuffs  things whose raw materials had been within 
the reach of every peasant family had been spun and woven by it for its own use  were now 
transformed  into  articles  of  manufacture  to  which  the  country  districts  at  once  served  for 
markets  The  many  scattered  customers  whom  stray  artisans  until  now  had  found  in  the 
numerous small producers working on their own account concentrate themselves now into one 
great market provided for by industrial capital Thus hand in hand with the expropriation of the 
selfsupporting  peasants  with  their  separation  from  their  means  of  production  goes  the 
destruction  of  rural  domestic  industry  the  process  of  separation  between  manufacture  and 
agriculture And only the destruction of rural domestic industry can give the internal market of a 
country that extension and consistence which the capitalist mode of production requires Still the 
manufacturing  period  properly  so  called  does  not  succeed  in  carrying  out  this  transformation 
radically and completely It will be remembered that manufacture properly so called conquers 
but partially the domain of national production and always rests on the handicrafts of the town 
and the domestic industry of the rural districts as its ultimate basis If it destroys these in one 
form in particular branches at certain points it calls them up again elsewhere because it needs 
them for the preparation of raw material up to a certain point It produces therefore a new class 
of small villagers who while following the cultivation of the soil as an accessory calling find 
their chief occupation in industrial labour the products of which they sell to the manufacturers 
directly  or  through  the  medium  of  merchants  This  is  one  though  not  the  chief  cause  of  a 
phenomenon which at first puzzles the student of English history From the last third of the 
th  century  he  finds  continually  complaints  only  interrupted  at  certain  intervals  about  the 
encroachment of capitalist farming in the country districts and the progressive destruction of the 
 

 

Chapter  
 
peasantry  On  the  other  hand  he  always  finds  this  peasantry  turning  up  again  although  in 
diminished number and always under worse conditions The chief reason is England is at one 
time chiefly a cultivator of corn at another chiefly a breeder of cattle in alternate periods and 
with  these  the  extent  of  peasant  cultivation  fluctuates  Modern  Industry  alone  and  finally 
supplies  in  machinery  the  lasting  basis  of  capitalistic  agriculture  expropriates  radically  the 
enormous  majority  of  the  agricultural  population  and  completes  the  separation  between 
agriculture  and  rural  domestic  industry  whose  roots   spinning  and  weaving    it  tears  up  It 
therefore  also  for  the  first  time  conquers  for  industrial  capital  the  entire  home  market

manufactures 
 Twenty pounds of wool converted unobtrusively into yearly clothing of a labourers family by its 
own industry in the intervals of other works  this makes no show but bring it to market send it to 
the factory thence to the broker thence to the dealer and you will have great commercial operations 
and  nominal  capital  engaged  to  the  amount  of  twenty  times  its  value  The  workingclass  is  thus

But now comes Carey and cries out upon England surely not with unreason that it is trying to turn

plough and the loom the hammer and the harrow The Slave Trade p According to him 
Urquhart  himself  is  one  of  the  chief  agents  in  the  ruin  of  Turkey  where  he  had  made  Freetrade

Chapter  The Genesis of the Industrial 

Capitalist 

The  genesis  of  the  industrial  capitalist  did  not  proceed  in  such  a  gradual  way  as  that  of  the 
farmer Doubtless many small guildmasters and yet more independent small artisans or even 
wage  labourers  transformed  themselves  into  small  capitalists  and  by  gradually  extending 
exploitation of wage labour and corresponding accumulation into fullblown capitalists In the 
infancy of capitalist production things often happened as in the infancy of medieval towns where 
the question which of the escaped serfs should be master and which servant was in great part 
decided by the earlier or later date of their flight The snails pace of this method corresponded in 
no wise with the commercial requirements of the new world market that the great discoveries of 
the end of the th century created But the middle ages had handed down two distinct forms of 
capital which mature in the most different economic social formations and which before the era 
of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  are  considered  as  capital  quand  mme  all  the  same   
usurers capital and merchants capital  

At present all the wealth of society goes first into the possession of the capitalist 
 he pays the landowner his rent the labourer his wages the tax and tithe 
gatherer their claims and keeps a large indeed the largest and a continually 
augmenting share of the annual produce of labour for himself The capitalist may 
now be said to be the first owner of all the wealth of the community though no 
law has conferred on him the right to this property this change has been effected 
by the taking of interest on capital  and it is not a little curious that all the law
givers of Europe endeavoured to prevent this by statutes viz statutes against 
usury The power of the capitalist over all the wealth of the country is a 
complete change in the right of property and by what law or series of laws was it 
effected  

The author should have remembered that revolutions are not made by laws  
The money capital formed by  means of usury and commerce was prevented from turning into 
industrial  capital  in  the  country  by  the  feudal  constitution  in  the  towns  by  the  guild 
organisation These fetters vanished with the dissolution of feudal society with the expropriation 
and  partial  eviction of the  country  population The new  manufactures  were  established  at  sea
ports or at inland points beyond the control of the old municipalities and their guilds Hence in 
England an embittered struggle of the corporate towns against these new industrial nurseries  
The  discovery  of  gold  and  silver  in  America  the  extirpation enslavement  and entombment  in 
mines of the aboriginal population the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies 
the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of blackskins signalised the rosy 
dawn  of  the  era  of  capitalist  production  These  idyllic  proceedings  are  the  chief  momenta  of 
primitive accumulation On their heels treads the commercial war of the European nations with 
the globe for a theatre It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain assumes giant 
dimensions in Englands AntiJacobin War and is still going on in the opium wars against China

  Industrial here  in  contradistinction  to  agricultural In the  categoric  sense  the  farmer  is  an  industrial  capitalist  as 
much as the manufacturer 

 

 

Chapter  
 
The  different  momenta  of  primitive  accumulation  distribute  themselves  now  more  or  less  in 
chronological order particularly over Spain Portugal Holland France and England In England 
at the end of the th century they arrive at a systematical combination embracing the colonies 
the  national  debt  the  modern  mode  of  taxation  and  the  protectionist  system  These  methods 
depend in part on brute force eg the colonial system But they all employ the power of the 
State the concentrated and organised force of society to hasten hothouse fashion the process of 
transformation  of  the  feudal  mode  of  production  into  the  capitalist  mode  and  to  shorten  the 
transition  Force  is  the  midwife  of  every  old  society  pregnant  with  a  new  one  It  is  itself  an 
economic power  
Of the Christian colonial system W Howitt a man who makes a speciality of Christianity says 

The barbarities and desperate outrages of the socalled Christian race throughout 
every region of the world and upon every people they have been able to subdue 
are not to be paralleled by those of any other race however fierce however 
untaught and however reckless of mercy and of shame in any age of the earth  

The  history  of  the  colonial  administration  of  Holland    and  Holland  was  the  head  capitalistic 
nation of the th century

meanness  

Nothing is more characteristic than their system of stealing men to get slaves for Java The men 
stealers  were  trained  for  this  purpose  The  thief  the  interpreter  and  the  seller  were  the  chief 
agents in this trade native princes the chief sellers The young people stolen were thrown into 
the secret dungeons of Celebes until they were ready for sending to the slaveships An official 
report says 

This one town of Macassar eg is full of secret prisons one more horrible than 
the other crammed with unfortunates victims of greed and tyranny fettered in 
chains forcibly torn from their families  

To secure Malacca the Dutch corrupted the Portuguese governor He let them into the town in 
 They hurried at once to his house and assassinated him to abstain from the payment of 
 the price of his treason Wherever they set foot devastation and depopulation followed

Sweet commerce  
The English East India Company as is well known obtained besides the political rule in India 
the exclusive monopoly of the teatrade as well as of the Chinese trade in general and of the 
transport of goods to and from Europe But the coasting trade of India and between the islands as 
well as the internal trade of India were the monopoly of the higher employs of the company 
The monopolies of salt opium betel and other commodities were inexhaustible mines of wealth 
The  employs  themselves  fixed  the  price  and  plundered  at  will  the  unhappy  Hindus  The 
GovernorGeneral  took  part  in  this  private  traffic  His  favourites  received  contracts  under 
conditions whereby they cleverer than the alchemists made gold out of nothing Great fortunes 
sprang up like mushrooms in a day primitive accumulation went on without the advance of a 
shilling The trial of Warren Hastings swarms with such cases Here is an instance A contract for 
opium was given to a certain Sullivan at the moment of his departure on an official mission to a 
part  of  India  far  removed  from  the  opium  district  Sullivan  sold  his  contract  to  one  Binn  for 
 Binn sold it the same day for  and the ultimate purchaser who carried out the 
contract declared that after all he realised an enormous gain According to one of the lists laid 
before  Parliament  the  Company  and  its  employs  from    got    from  the 
Indians as gifts Between  and  the English manufactured a famine by buying up all the 
rice and refusing to sell it again except at fabulous prices  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The treatment of the aborigines was naturally most frightful in plantationcolonies destined for 
export  trade  only  such  as  the  West  Indies  and  in  rich  and  wellpopulated  countries  such  as 
Mexico and India that were given over to plunder But even in the colonies properly so called 
the  Christian  character  of  primitive  accumulation  did  not  belie  itself  Those  sober  virtuosi  of 
Protestantism the Puritans of New England in  by decrees of their assembly set a premium 
of  on every Indian scalp and every captured redskin in  a premium of  on every 
scalp in  after MassachusettsBay had proclaimed a certain tribe as rebels the following 
prices for a male scalp of  years and upwards  new currency for a male prisoner  
for  women  and  children  prisoners    for  scalps  of  women  and  children    Some  decades 
later the colonial system took its revenge on the descendants of the pious pilgrim fathers who 
had  grown  seditious  in  the  meantime  At  English  instigation  and  for  English  pay  they  were 
tomahawked  by  redskins  The  British  Parliament  proclaimed  bloodhounds  and  scalping  as 
means that God and Nature had given into its hand  
The colonial system ripened like a hothouse trade and navigation The societies Monopolia of 
Luther were powerful levers for concentration of capital The colonies secured a market for the 
budding manufactures and through the monopoly of the market an increased accumulation The 
treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting enslavement and murder floated back 
to the mothercountry and were there turned into capital Holland which first fully developed the 
colonial system in  stood already in the acme of its commercial greatness It was 

in almost exclusive possession of the East Indian trade and the commerce 
between the southeast and northwest of Europe Its fisheries marine 
manufactures surpassed those of any other country The total capital of the 
Republic was probably more important than that of all the rest of Europe put 
together Glich forgets to add that by  the people of Holland were more 
overworked poorer and more brutally oppressed than those of all the rest of 
Europe put together  

Today  industrial  supremacy  implies  commercial  supremacy  In  the  period  of  manufacture 
properly  so  called  it  is  on  the  other  hand  the  commercial  supremacy  that  gives  industrial 
predominance Hence the preponderant rle that the colonial system plays at that time It was the 
strange God who perched himself on the altar cheek by jowl with the old Gods of Europe and 
one fine day with a shove and a kick chucked them all of a heap It proclaimed surplusvalue 
making as the sole end and aim of humanity  
The system of public credit ie of national debts whose origin we discover in Genoa and Venice 
as  early  as  the  Middle  Ages  took  possession  of  Europe  generally  during  the  manufacturing 
period The colonial  system  with  its  maritime  trade and  commercial  wars served  as  a  forcing
house for it Thus it first took root in Holland National debts ie the alienation of the state  
whether despotic constitutional or republican  marked with its stamp the capitalistic era The 
only part of the socalled national wealth that actually enters into the collective possessions of 
modern peoples is their national debt Hence as a necessary consequence the modern doctrine 
that a nation becomes the richer the more deeply it is in debt Public credit becomes the credo of 
capital And with the rise of national debtmaking want of faith in the national debt takes the 
place of the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which may not be forgiven  
The public debt becomes one of the most powerful levers of primitive accumulation As with the 
stroke of an enchanters wand it endows barren money with the power of breeding and thus turns 
it into capital without the necessity of its exposing  itself to the troubles and risks inseparable 
from its employment in industry or even in usury The state creditors actually give nothing away 
for the sum lent is transformed into public bonds easily negotiable which go on functioning in 
their hands just as so much hard cash would But further apart from the class of lazy annuitants

thus  created  and  from  the  improvised  wealth  of  the  financiers  middlemen  between  the 
government and the nation  as also apart from the taxfarmers merchants private manufacturers 
to whom a good part of every national loan renders the service of a capital fallen from heaven  
the national debt has given rise to jointstock companies to dealings in negotiable effects of all 
kinds and to agiotage in a word to stockexchange gambling and the modern bankocracy  
At  their  birth the  great  banks  decorated  with  national  titles  were only  associations  of  private 
speculators who placed themselves by the side of governments and thanks to the privileges they 
received  were  in  a  position  to  advance  money  to  the  State  Hence  the  accumulation  of  the 
national debt has no more infallible measure than the successive rise in the stock of these banks 
whose full development dates from the founding of the Bank of England in  The Bank of 
England  began  with  lending  its  money  to  the  Government  at    at  the  same  time  it  was 
empowered by Parliament to coin money out of the same capital by lending it again to the public 
in the form of banknotes It was allowed to use these notes for discounting bills making advances 
on commodities and for buying the precious metals It was not long ere this creditmoney made 
by the bank itself became the coin in which the Bank of England made its loans to the State and 
paid on account of the State the interest on the public debt It was not enough that the bank gave 
with one hand and took back more with the other it remained even whilst receiving the eternal 
creditor  of  the  nation  down  to  the  last  shilling  advanced  Gradually  it  became  inevitably  the 
receptacle of the metallic hoard of the country and the centre of gravity of all commercial credit 
What  effect  was  produced  on  their  contemporaries  by  the  sudden  uprising  of  this  brood  of 
bankocrats financiers rentiers brokers stockjobbers c is proved by the writings of that time 
eg by Bolingbrokes  
With  the  national  debt  arose  an  international  credit  system  which  often  conceals  one  of  the 
sources  of  primitive  accumulation  in  this  or  that  people  Thus  the  villainies  of  the  Venetian 
thieving system formed one of the secret bases of the capitalwealth of Holland to whom Venice 
in her decadence lent large sums of money So also was it with Holland and England By the 
beginning of the th century the Dutch manufactures were far outstripped Holland had ceased 
to  be  the  nation  preponderant  in  commerce  and  industry  One  of  its  main  lines  of  business 
therefore from  is the lending out of enormous amounts of capital especially to its 
great rival England The same thing is going on today between England and the United States A 
great deal of capital which appears today in the United States without any certificate of birth was 
yesterday in England the capitalised blood of children  
As  the  national  debt  finds  its  support  in  the  public  revenue  which  must  cover  the  yearly 
payments for interest c the modern system of taxation was the necessary complement of the 
system  of  national  loans  The  loans  enable  the  government  to  meet  extraordinary  expenses 
without the taxpayers feeling it immediately but they necessitate as a consequence increased 
taxes On the other hand the raising of taxation caused by the accumulation of debts contracted 
one  after  another  compels  the  government  always  to  have  recourse  to  new  loans  for  new 
extraordinary expenses Modern fiscality whose pivot is formed by taxes on the most necessary 
means  of  subsistence  thereby  increasing  their  price  thus  contains  within  itself  the  germ  of 
automatic  progression  Overtaxation  is  not  an  incident  but  rather  a  principle  In  Holland 
therefore where this system was first inaugurated the great patriot DeWitt has in his Maxims 
extolled it as the best system for making the wage labourer submissive frugal industrious and 
overburdened with labour The destructive influence that it exercises on the condition of the wage 
labourer  concerns  us  less  however  here  than  the  forcible  expropriation  resulting  from  it  of 
peasants artisans and in a word all elements of the lower middle class On this there are not two 
opinions  even  among  the  bourgeois  economists  Its  expropriating  efficacy  is  still  further 
heightened by the system of protection which forms one of its integral parts  

 

 

Chapter  
 
The great part that the public debt and the fiscal system corresponding with it has played in the 
capitalisation of wealth and the expropriation of the masses has led many writers like Cobbett 
Doubleday  and  others  to seek  in this  incorrectly  the  fundamental  cause  of  the  misery  of the 
modern peoples  
The  system  of  protection  was  an  artificial  means  of  manufacturing  manufacturers  of 
expropriating  independent  labourers  of  capitalising  the  national  means  of  production  and 
subsistence  of  forcibly  abbreviating  the  transition  from  the  medieval  to  the  modern  mode  of 
production The European states tore one another to pieces about the patent of this invention and 
once entered into the service of the surplusvalue makers did not merely lay under contribution in 
the pursuit of this purpose their own people indirectly through protective duties directly through 
export premiums They also forcibly rooted out in their dependent countries all industry as eg 
England  did  with  the  Irish  woollen  manufacture  On  the  continent  of  Europe  after  Colberts 
example the process was much simplified The primitive industrial capital here came in part 
directly out of the state treasury Why cries Mirabeau why go so far to seek the cause of the 
manufacturing  glory  of  Saxony  before  the  war    of  debts  contracted  by  the 
sovereigns  
Colonial system public debts heavy taxes protection commercial wars c these children of 
the true manufacturing period increase gigantically during the infancy of Modem Industry The 
birth  of  the  latter  is  heralded  by  a  great  slaughter  of  the  innocents  Like  the  royal  navy  the 
factories were recruited by means of the pressgang Blas as Sir F M Eden is as to the horrors 
of the expropriation of the agricultural population from the soil from the last third of the th 
century  to  his  own  time  with  all  the  selfsatisfaction  with  which  he  rejoices  in  this  process 
essential  for  establishing  capitalistic  agriculture and  the  due  proportion  between  arable and 
pasture land  he does not show however the same economic insight in respect to the necessity 
of  childstealing  and  childslavery  for  the  transformation  of  manufacturing  exploitation  into 
factory  exploitation  and  the  establishment  of  the  true  relation  between  capital  and  labour
power He says 

It may perhaps be worthy the attention of the public to consider whether any 
manufacture which in order to be carried on successfully requires that cottages 
and workhouses should be ransacked for poor children that they should be 
employed by turns during the greater part of the night and robbed of that rest 
which though indispensable to all is most required by the young and that 
numbers of both sexes of different ages and dispositions should be collected 
together in such a manner that the contagion of example cannot but lead to 
profligacy and debauchery will add to the sum of individual or national 
felicity  
In the counties of Derbyshire Nottinghamshire and more particularly in 
Lancashire says Fielden the newlyinvented machinery was used in large 
factories built on the sides of streams capable of turning the waterwheel 
Thousands of hands were suddenly required in these places remote from towns 
and Lancashire in particular being till then comparatively thinly populated and 
barren a population was all that she now wanted The small and nimble fingers of 
little children being by very far the most in request the custom instantly sprang up 
of procuring apprentices from the different parish workhouses of London 
Birmingham and elsewhere Many many thousands of these little hapless 
creatures were sent down into the north being from the age of  to the age of  
or  years old The custom was for the master to clothe his apprentices and to 
feed and lodge them in an apprentice house near the factory overseers were

appointed to see to the works whose interest it was to work the children to the 
utmost because their pay was in proportion to the quantity of work that they could 
exact Cruelty was of course the consequence  In many of the manufacturing 
districts but particularly I am afraid in the guilty county to which I belong 
Lancashire cruelties the most heartrending were practised upon the 
unoffending and friendless creatures who were thus consigned to the charge of 
mastermanufacturers they were harassed to the brink of death by excess of 
labour  were flogged fettered and tortured in the most exquisite refinement of 
cruelty  they were in many cases starved to the bone while flogged to their 
work and  even in some instances  were driven to commit suicide The 
beautiful and romantic valleys of Derbyshire Nottinghamshire and Lancashire 
secluded from the public eye became the dismal solitudes of torture and of many 
a murder The profits of manufacturers were enormous but this only whetted the 
appetite that it should have satisfied and therefore the manufacturers had recourse 
to an expedient that seemed to secure to them those profits without any possibility 
of limit they began the practice of what is termed nightworking that is having 
tired one set of hands by working them throughout the day they had another set 
ready to go on working throughout the night the dayset getting into the beds that 
the nightset had just quitted and in their turn again the nightset getting into the 
beds that the dayset quitted in the morning It is a common tradition in 
Lancashire that the beds never get cold  

With  the  development  of  capitalist  production  during  the  manufacturing  period  the  public 
opinion  of  Europe  had  lost  the  last  remnant  of  shame  and  conscience  The  nations  bragged 
cynically of every infamy that served them as a means to capitalistic accumulation Read eg the 
nave Annals of Commerce of the worthy A Anderson Here it is trumpeted forth as a triumph of 
English  statecraft  that  at  the  Peace  of  Utrecht  England  extorted  from  the  Spaniards  by  the 
Asiento Treaty the privilege of being allowed to ply the negro trade until then only carried on 
between  Africa  and  the  English  West  Indies  between  Africa  and  Spanish  America  as  well 
England thereby acquired the right of supplying Spanish America until  with  negroes 
yearly This threw at the same time an official cloak over British smuggling Liverpool waxed 
fat on the slave trade This was its method of primitive accumulation And even to the present 
day  Liverpool  respectability  is  the  Pindar  of  the  slave  trade  which    compare  the  work  of 
Aikin    already  quoted    has  coincided  with  that  spirit  of  bold  adventure  which  has 
characterised the trade of Liverpool and rapidly carried it to its present state of prosperity has 
occasioned vast employment for shipping and sailors and greatly augmented the demand for the 
manufactures of the country p  Liverpool employed in the slavetrade in   ships 
in   in   in   and in    
Whilst  the  cotton  industry  introduced  childslavery  in  England  it  gave  in  the  United  States  a 
stimulus to the transformation of the earlier more or less patriarchal slavery into a system of 
commercial exploitation In fact the veiled slavery of the wage workers in Europe needed for its 
pedestal slavery pure and simple in the new world  
Tantae molis erat to establish the eternal laws of Nature of the capitalist mode of production to 
complete the process of separation between labourers and conditions of labour to transform at 
one pole the social means of production and subsistence into capital at the opposite pole the 
mass of the population into wage labourers into free labouring poor that artificial product of 
modern  society  If  money  according  to  Augier  comes  into  the  world  with  a  congenital 
bloodstain on one cheek capital comes dripping from head to foot from every pore with blood

true but this is very incompletely stating the question Capital eschews no profit or very small profit

Chapter  Historical Tendency of Capitalist 

Accumulation 

What does the primitive accumulation of capital ie its historical genesis resolve itself into In 
so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves and serfs into wage labourers and therefore 
a  mere  change  of  form  it  only  means  the  expropriation  of  the  immediate  producers  ie  the 
dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner Private property as the antithesis 
to social collective property exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of 
labour belong to private individuals But according as these private individuals are labourers or 
not labourers private property has a different character The numberless shades that it at first 
sight  presents  correspond  to  the  intermediate  stages  lying  between  these  two  extremes  The 
private property of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry 
whether agricultural manufacturing or both petty industry again is an essential condition for 
the  development  of  social  production  and  of  the free  individuality  of  the labourer  himself  Of 
course  this  petty  mode  of  production  exists  also  under  slavery  serfdom  and  other  states  of 
dependence But it flourishes it lets loose its whole energy it attains its adequate classical form 
only where the labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by himself 
the peasant of the land which he cultivates the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso 
This mode of production presupposes parcelling of the soil and scattering of the other means of 
production As it excludes the concentration of these means of production so also it excludes co
operation division of labour within each separate process of production the control over and the 
productive application of the forces of Nature by society and the free development of the social 
productive  powers  It  is  compatible  only  with  a  system  of  production  and  a  society  moving 
within narrow and more or less primitive bounds To perpetuate it would be as Pecqueur rightly 
says  to  decree  universal  mediocrity  At  a  certain  stage  of  development  it  brings  forth  the 
material agencies for its own dissolution From that moment new forces and new passions spring 
up in the bosom of society but the old social organisation fetters them and keeps them down It 
must be annihilated it is annihilated Its annihilation the transformation of the individualised and 
scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones of the pigmy property of the many 
into the huge property of the few the expropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil 
from  the  means  of  subsistence  and  from  the  means  of  labour  this  fearful  and  painful 
expropriation of the mass of the people forms the prelude to the history of capital It comprises a 
series of forcible methods of which we have passed in review only those that have been epoch
making as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital The expropriation of the immediate 
producers was accomplished with merciless Vandalism and under the stimulus of passions the 
most  infamous  the  most  sordid  the  pettiest  the  most  meanly  odious  Selfearned  private 
property that is based so to say on the fusing together of the isolated independent labouring 
individual with the conditions of his labour is supplanted by capitalistic private property which 
rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others ie on wage labour 
As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to 
bottom as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians their means of labour into capital as 
soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet then the further socialisation of 
labour  and  further  transformation  of  the  land  and  other  means  of  production  into  socially 
exploited and therefore common  means of production as well as the further expropriation of 
private  proprietors  takes  a  new  form  That  which  is  now  to  be  expropriated  is  no  longer  the 
labourer working for himself but the capitalist exploiting many labourers This expropriation is 
accomplished  by  the  action  of  the  immanent  laws  of  capitalistic  production  itself  by  the 

 

 
centralisation of capital One capitalist always kills many Hand in hand with this centralisation 
or  this  expropriation  of  many  capitalists  by  few  develop  on  an  everextending  scale  the  co
operative  form  of  the  labour  process  the  conscious  technical  application  of  science  the 
methodical cultivation of the soil the transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments 
of labour only usable in common the economising of all means of production by their use as 
means of production of combined socialised labour the entanglement of all peoples in the net of 
the world market and with this the international character of the capitalistic regime Along with 
the  constantly  diminishing  number  of  the  magnates  of  capital  who  usurp  and  monopolise  all 
advantages  of  this  process  of  transformation  grows  the  mass  of  misery  oppression  slavery 
degradation exploitation but with this too grows the revolt of the working class a class always 
increasing in numbers and disciplined united organised by the very mechanism of the process of 
capitalist  production  itself  The  monopoly  of  capital  becomes  a  fetter  upon  the  mode  of 
production which has sprung up and flourished along with and under it Centralisation of the 
means  of  production  and  socialisation  of  labour  at  last  reach  a  point  where  they  become 
incompatible  with  their  capitalist  integument  This  integument  is  burst  asunder  The  knell  of 
capitalist private property sounds The expropriators are expropriated  
The  capitalist  mode  of  appropriation the result  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  produces 
capitalist private property This is the first negation of individual private property as founded on 
the labour of the proprietor But capitalist production begets with the inexorability of a law of 
Nature its own negation It is the negation of negation This does not reestablish private property 
for the producer but gives him individual property based on the acquisition of the capitalist era 
ie on cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production  
The transformation  of  scattered  private  property  arising  from  individual  labour  into  capitalist 
private property is naturally a process incomparably more protracted violent and difficult than 
the  transformation  of  capitalistic  private  property  already  practically  resting  on  socialised 
production into socialised property In the former case we had the expropriation of the mass of 
the people by a few usurpers in the latter we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the 
mass of the people

 The advance of industry whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie replaces the isolation of the 
labourers  due  to  competition  by  their  revolutionary  combination  due  to  association  The 
development of Modern Industry therefore cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the 
bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products What the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all 
are its own gravediggers Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable Of all the 
classes that stand facetoface with the bourgeoisie today the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary 
class  The  other  classes  perish  and  disappear  in  the  face  of  Modern  Industry  the  proletariat  is  its 
special and essential product The lower middle classes the small manufacturers the shopkeepers

Chapter  The Modern Theory of Colonisation  
Political economy confuses on principle two very different kinds of private property of which 
one rests on the producers own labour the other on the employment of the labour of others It 
forgets that the latter not only is the direct antithesis of the former but absolutely grows on its 
tomb  only  In  Western  Europe  the  home  of  Political  Economy  the  process  of  primitive 
accumulation  is  more  of  less  accomplished  Here  the  capitalist  regime  has  either  directly 
conquered  the  whole  domain  of  national  production  or  where  economic  conditions  are  less 
developed it at least indirectly controls those strata of society which though belonging to the 
antiquated mode of production continue to exist side by side with it in gradual decay To this 
readymade world of capital the political economist applies the notions of law and of property 
inherited from a precapitalistic world with all the more anxious zeal and all the greater unction 
the more loudly the facts cry out in the face of his ideology It is otherwise in the colonies There 
the capitalist regime everywhere comes into collision with the resistance of the producer who as 
owner  of  his  own  conditions  of  labour  employs  that  labour  to  enrich  himself  instead  of  the 
capitalist  The  contradiction  of  these  two  diametrically  opposed  economic  systems  manifests 
itself here practically in a struggle between them Where the capitalist has at his back the power 
of  the  mothercountry  he  tries  to  clear  out  of  his  way  by  force  the  modes  of  production  and 
appropriation based on the independent labour of the producer The same interest which compels 
the  sycophant  of  capital  the  political  economist  in  the  mothercountry  to  proclaim  the 
theoretical  identity  of  the  capitalist  mode  of  production  with  its  contrary  that  same  interest 
compels him in the colonies to make a clean breast of it and to proclaim aloud the antagonism of 
the  two  modes  of  production  To  this  end  he  proves  how  the  development  of  the  social 
productive power of labour cooperation division of labour use of machinery on a large scale 
c  are  impossible  without  the  expropriation  of  the  labourers  and  the  corresponding 
transformation of their means of production into capital In the interest of the socalled national 
wealth  he  seeks  for  artificial  means  to  ensure  the  poverty  of  the  people  Here  his  apologetic 
armor crumbles off bit by bit like rotten touchwood It is the great merit of EG Wakefield to 
have discovered not anything new about the Colonies but to have discovered in the Colonies 
the  truth  as to  the  conditions  of  capitalist  production  in  the  mother  country As  the  system  of 
protection at its origin attempted to manufacture capitalists artificially in the mothercountry so 
Wakefields colonisation theory which England tried for a time to enforce by Acts of Parliament 
attempted to effect the manufacture of wageworkers in the Colonies This he calls systematic 
colonisation  
First of all Wakefield discovered that in the Colonies property in money means of subsistence 
machines and other means of production does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be 
wanting the correlative  the wageworker the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his 
own free will He discovered that capital is not a thing but a social relation between persons 
established by the instrumentality of things Mr Peel he moans took with him from England to 
Swan River West Australia means of subsistence and of production to the amount of  
Mr Peel had the foresight to bring with him besides  persons of the working class men 
women  and  children  Once  arrived  at  his  destination  Mr  Peel  was  left  without  a  servant  to 
make his bed or fetch him water from the river Unhappy Mr Peel who provided for everything 
except the export of English modes of production to Swan River  
For the understanding of the following discoveries of Wakefield two preliminary remarks We 
know  that  the  means  of  production  and  subsistence  while  they  remain  the  property  of  the 
immediate producer are not capital They become capital only under circumstances in which they 

 

 

Chapter  
 
serve at the same time as means of exploitation and subjection of the labourer But this capitalist 
soul of theirs is so intimately wedded in the head of the political economist to their material 
substance that he christens them capital under all circumstances even when they are its exact 
opposite Thus is it with Wakefield Further the splitting up of the means of production into the 
individual property of many independent labourers working on their own account he calls equal 
division of capital It is with the political economist as with the feudal jurist The latter stuck on to 
pure monetary relations the labels supplied by feudal law  
If  says  Wakefield  all  members  of  the  society  are  supposed  to  possess  equal  portions  of 
capital no man would have a motive for accumulating more capital than he could use with his 
own hands This is to some extent the case in new American settlements where a passion for 
owning land prevents the existence of a class of labourers for hire So long therefore as the 
labourer can accumulate for himself  and this he can do so long as he remains possessor of his 
means  of  production    capitalist  accumulation  and  the  capitalistic  mode  of  production  are 
impossible The class of wage labourers essential to these is wanting How then in old Europe 
was  the  expropriation  of  the  labourer  from  his  conditions  of  labour  ie  the  coexistence  of 
capital and wage labour brought about By a social contract of a quite original kind Mankind 
have  adopted  a  simple  contrivance  for  promoting  the  accumulation  of  capital  which  of 
course since the time of Adam floated in their imagination floated in their imagination as the 
sole and final end of their existence they have divided themselves into owners of capital and 
owners of labour The division was the result of concert and combination In one word the 
mass of mankind expropriated itself in honour of the accumulation of capital Now one would 
think  that  this  instinct  of  selfdenying  fanaticism  would  give  itself  full  fling  especially  in  the 
Colonies where alone exist the men and conditions that could turn a social contract from a dream 
to a reality But why then should systematic colonisation be called in to replace its opposite 
spontaneous  unregulated  colonisation  But    but    In  the  Northern  States  of  the  American 
Union  it  may  be  doubted  whether  so  many  as  a  tenth  of  the  people  would  fall  under  the 
description  of  hired  labourers  In  England  the  labouring  class  compose  the  bulk  of  the 
people Nay the impulse to selfexpropriation on the part of labouring humanity for the glory of 
capital exists so little that slavery according to Wakefield himself is the sole natural basis of 
Colonial wealth His systematic colonisation is a mere pis aller since he unfortunately has to do 
with  free  men  not  with  slaves  The  first  Spanish  settlers  in  Saint  Domingo  did  not  obtain 
labourers from Spain But without labourers their capital must have perished or at least must 
soon have been diminished to that small amount which each individual could employ with his 
own hands This has actually occurred in the last Colony founded by England  the Swan River 
Settlement  where a great mass of capital of seeds implements and cattle has perished for want 
of labourers to use it and where no settler has preserved much more capital than he can employ 
with his own hands  
We have seen that the expropriation of the mass of the people from the soil forms the basis of the 
capitalist mode of production The essence of a free colony on the contrary consists in this  that 
the bulk of the soil is still public property and every settler on it therefore can turn part of it into 
his private property and individual means of production without hindering the later settlers in the 
same operation This is the secret both of the prosperity of the colonies and of their inveterate 
vice  opposition to the establishment of capital Where land is very cheap and all men are free 
where every one who so pleases can easily obtain a piece of land for himself not only is labour 
very dear as respects the labourers share of the produce but the difficulty is to obtain combined 
labour at any price  
As in the colonies the separation of the labourer from the conditions of labour and their root the 
soil does not exist or only sporadically or on too limited a scale so neither does the separation 
of agriculture from industry exist nor the destruction of the household industry of the peasantry 

 

 

Chapter  
 
Whence then is to come the internal market for capital No part of the population of America is 
exclusively agricultural excepting slaves and their employers who combine capital and labour in 
particular works Free Americans who cultivate the soil follow many other occupations Some 
portion  of  the  furniture  and  tools  which  they  use  is  commonly  made  by  themselves  They 
frequently build their own houses and carry to market at whatever distance the produce of their 
own industry They are spinners and weavers they make soap and candles as well as in many 
cases  shoes  and  clothes  for  their  own  use  In  America  the  cultivation  of  land  is  often  the 
secondary pursuit of a blacksmith a miller or a shopkeeper With such queer people as these 
where is the field of abstinence for the capitalists  
The great beauty of capitalist production consists in this  that it not only constantly reproduces 
the  wageworker  as  wageworker  but  produces  always  in  proportion  to  the  accumulation  of 
capital  a  relative  surpluspopulation  of  wageworkers Thus  the law  of  supply and  demand  of 
labour  is  kept  in  the  right  rut  the  oscillation  of  wages  is  penned  within  limits  satisfactory  to 
capitalist  exploitation  and  lastly  the  social  dependence  of  the  labourer  on  the  capitalist  that 
indispensable  requisite  is  secured  an  unmistakable  relation  of  dependence  which  the  smug 
political economist at home in the mothercountry can transmogrify into one of free contract 
between buyer and seller between equally independent owners of commodities the owner of the 
commodity capital and the owner of the commodity labour But in the colonies this pretty fancy 
is torn asunder The absolute population here increases much more quickly than in the mother
country because many labourers enter this world as readymade adults and yet the labourmarket 
is always understocked The law of supply and demand of labour falls to pieces On the one hand 
the old world constantly throws in capital thirsting after exploitation and abstinence on the 
other the regular reproduction of the wage labourer as wage labourer comes into collision with 
impediments  the  most  impertinent  and  in  part  invincible  What  becomes  of  the  production  of 
wagelabourers supernumerary in proportion to the accumulation of capital The wageworker of 
today is tomorrow an independent peasant or artisan working for himself He vanishes from 
the  labourmarket  but  not  into  the  workhouse  This  constant  transformation  of  the  wage
labourers into independent producers who work for themselves instead of for capital and enrich 
themselves instead of the capitalist gentry reacts in its turn very perversely on the conditions of 
the  labourmarket  Not  only  does  the  degree  of  exploitation  of  the  wage  labourer  remain 
indecently low The wage labourer loses into the bargain along with the relation of dependence 
also the sentiment of dependence on the abstemious capitalist Hence all the inconveniences that 
our  E  G Wakefield  pictures so  doughtily  so eloquently  so  pathetically  The  supply  of  wage 
labour  he  complains  is  neither  constant  nor  regular  nor  sufficient  The  supply  of  labour  is 
always not only small but uncertain Though the produce divided between the capitalist and 
the labourer be large the labourer takes so great a share that he soon becomes a capitalist Few 
even  those  whose  lives  are  unusually  long  can  accumulate  great  masses  of  wealth  The 
labourers most distinctly decline to allow the capitalist to abstain from the payment of the greater 
part of their labour It avails him nothing if he is so cunning as to import from Europe with his 
own capital his own wageworkers They soon cease to be labourers for hire they become 
independent  landowners  if  not  competitors  with  their  former  masters  in  the  labourmarket 
Think of the horror The excellent capitalist has imported bodily from Europe with his own good 
money his own competitors The end of the world has come No wonder Wakefield laments the 
absence of all dependence and of all sentiment of dependence on the part of the wageworkers in 
the colonies On account of the high wages says his disciple Merivale there is in the colonies 
the urgent desire for cheaper and more subservient labourers  for a class to whom the capitalist 
might  dictate  terms  instead  of  being  dictated  to  by  them  In  ancient  civilised  countries  the 
labourer though free is by a law of Nature dependent on capitalists in colonies this dependence 
must be created by artificial means  

 

 

Chapter  
 
What is now according to Wakefield the consequence of this unfortunate state of things in the 
colonies  A  barbarising  tendency  of  dispersion  of  producers  and  national  wealth  The 
parcellingout  of  the  means  of  production  among  innumerable  owners  working  on  their  own 
account  annihilates  along  with  the  centralisation  of  capital  all  the  foundation  of  combined 
labour Every longwinded undertaking extending over several years and demanding outlay of 
fixed capital is prevented from being carried out In Europe capital invests without hesitating a 
moment for the working  class constitutes its living  appurtenance always in excess always at 
disposal But in the colonies Wakefield tells an extremely doleful anecdote He was talking with 
some capitalists of Canada and the state of New York where the immigrant wave often becomes 
stagnant and deposits a sediment of supernumerary labourers Our capital says one of the 
characters in the melodrama was ready for many operations which require a considerable period 
of time for their completion but we could not begin such operations with labour which we knew 
would soon leave us If we had been sure of retaining the labour of such emigrants we should 
have been glad to have engaged it at once and for a high price and we should have engaged it 
even though we had been sure it would leave us provided we had been sure of a fresh supply 
whenever we might need it  
After Wakefield has constructed the English capitalist agriculture and its combined labour with 
the scattered cultivation of American peasants he unwittingly gives us a glimpse at the reverse of 
the medal He depicts the mass of the American people as welltodo independent enterprising 
and  comparatively  cultured  whilst  the  English  agricultural  labourer  is  miserable  wretch  a 
pauper In what country except North America and some new colonies do the wages of free 
labour employed in agriculture much exceed a bare subsistence for the labourer  Undoubtedly  
farmhorses in England being a valuable property are better fed than English peasants But 
never mind national wealth is once again by its very nature identical with misery of the people  
How then to heal the anticapitalistic cancer of the colonies If men were willing at a blow to 
turn all the soil from public into private property they would destroy certainly the root of the evil 
but also  the colonies The trick is how to kill two birds with one stone Let the Government put 
upon the virgin soil an artificial price independent of the law of supply and demand a price that 
compels the immigrant to work a long time for wages before he can earn enough money to buy 
land and turn himself into an independent peasant The fund resulting from the sale of land at a 
price relatively prohibitory for the wageworkers this fund of money extorted from the wages of 
labour by violation of the sacred law of supply and demand the Government is to employ on the 
other hand in proportion as it grows to import havenothings from Europe into the colonies and 
thus keep the wage labour  market full for the capitalists Under these circumstances tout sera 
pour  le  mieux  dans  le  meilleur  des  mondes  possibles  This  is  the  great  secret  of  systematic 
colonisation By this plan Wakefield cries in triumph the supply of labour must be constant 
and regular because first as no labourer would be able to procure land until he had worked for 
money all immigrant labourers working for a time for wages and in combination would produce 
capital  for  the  employment  of  more  labourers  secondly  because  every  labourer  who  left  off 
working  for  wages  and  became  a  landowner  would  by  purchasing  land  provide  a  fund  for 
bringing fresh labour to the colony The price of the soil imposed by the State must of course 
be  a  sufficient  price    ie  so  high  as  to  prevent the labourers  from  becoming  independent 
landowners until others had followed to take their place This sufficient price for the land is 
nothing but a euphemistic circumlocution for the ransom which the labourer pays to the capitalist 
for leave to retire from the wage labour market to the land First he must create for the capitalist 
capital with which the latter may be able to exploit more labourers then he must place at his 
own  expense  a  locum  tenens  placeholder  on  the  labour  market  whom  the  Government 
forwards across the sea for the benefit of his old master the capitalist

It is very characteristic that the English Government for years practised this method of primitive 
accumulation prescribed by Mr Wakefield expressly for the use of the colonies The fiasco was 
of course as complete as that of Sir Robert Peels Bank Act The stream of emigration was only 
diverted from the English colonies to the United States Meanwhile the advance of capitalistic 
production  in  Europe  accompanied  by  increasing  Government  pressure  has  rendered 
Wakefields  recipe  superfluous  On  the  one  hand  the  enormous  and  ceaseless  stream  of  men 
year after year driven upon America leaves behind a stationary sediment in the east of the United 
States  the  wave  of  immigration  from  Europe  throwing  men  on  the  labourmarket  there  more 
rapidly  than  the  wave  of  emigration  westwards  can  wash  them  away  On  the  other  hand  the 
American Civil War brought in its train a colossal national debt and with it pressure of taxes 
the rise of the vilest financial aristocracy the squandering of a huge part of the public land on 
speculative  companies  for  the  exploitation  of  railways  mines  c  in  brief  the  most  rapid 
centralisation  of  capital  The  great  republic  has  therefore  ceased  to  be  the  promised  land  for 
emigrant  labourers  Capitalistic  production  advances  there  with  giant  strides  even  though  the 
lowering of wages and the dependence of the wageworker are yet far from being brought down 
to the normal European level The shameless lavishing of uncultivated colonial land on aristocrats 
and  capitalists  by  the  Government  so  loudly  denounced  even  by  Wakefield  has  produced 
especially in Australia in conjunction with the stream of men that the gold diggings attract and 
with  the  competition  that  the  importation  of  Englishcommodities  causes  even  to  the  smallest 
artisan  an  ample  relative  surplus  labouring  population  so that almost  every  mail  brings  the 
Jobs  news  of  a  glut  of  the  Australia  labourmarket  and  the  prostitution  in  some  places 
flourishes as wantonly as in the London Haymarket  
However  we  are  not  concerned  here  with  the  conditions  of  the  colonies  The  only  thing  that 
interests us is the secret discovered in the new world by the Political Economy of the old world 
and proclaimed on the housetops that the capitalist mode of production and accumulation and 
therefore capitalist private property have for their fundamental condition the annihilation of self
earned private property in other words the expropriation of the labourer

 We treat here of real Colonies virgins soils colonized by free immigrants The United States are 
speaking  economically  still  only  a  Colony  of  Europe  Besides  to  this  category  belong  such  old 
plantations as those in which the abolition of slavery has completely altered the earlier conditions 
 Wakefields few glimpses on the subject of Modern Colonisation are fully anticipated by Mirabeau 
Pere the physiocrat and even much earlier by English economists 
 Later it became a temporary necessity in the international competitive struggle But whatever its 
motive the consequences remain the same 
 A negro is a negro In certain circumstances he becomes a slave A mule is a machine for spinning 
cotton Only under certain circumstances does it become capital Outside these circumstances it is no 
more  capital  than  gold  is  intrinsically  money  or  sugar  is  the  price  of  sugar  Capital  is  a  social 
relation of production It is a historical relation of production Karl Marx Lohnarbeit und Kapital

uns ni les autres prissent In the colonies where slavery has been abolished without the compulsory 
labour being replaced with an equivalent quantity of free labour there has occurred the opposite of 
what happens every day before our eyes Simple workers have been seen to exploit in their turn the 
industrial  entrepreneurs  demanding  from  them  wages  which  bear  absolutely  no  relation  to  the 
legitimate share in the product which they ought to receive The planters were unable to obtain for 
their sugar for a sufficent price to cover the increase in wages and were obliged to furnish the extra 
amount  at  first  out  of  their  profits  and  then  out  of  their  very  capital  A  considerable  amount  of 
planters have been ruined as a result while others have closed down their businesses in order to avoid 
the ruin which threatened them  It is doubtless better that these accumulations of capital should be 
destroyed than that generations of men should perish  but would it not be better if both survived

simple as to exploit the capitalist Mr Molinari feels a strong itching to set the law of supply and
