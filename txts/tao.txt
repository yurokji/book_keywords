Reading  Le  Guins  translations  is  like  taking  a  shared  walk  down  a
familiar  trail  where  we  discover  rocks  and  water  that  we  somehow
missed  before        undeniably  refreshing  capturing  a  language  that  is
casual  and  clear  reflective  and  pointed  full  of  the  wise  humor  of  the
Way

Introduction

The Tao Te Ching was probably written about twentyfive hundred years ago
perhaps by a man called Lao Tzu who may have lived at about the same time
as Confucius Nothing about it is certain except that its Chinese and very old
and speaks to people everywhere as if it had been written yesterday

The  first  Tao  Te  Ching  I  ever  saw  was  the  Paul  Carus  edition  of  
bound  in  yellow  cloth  stamped  with  blue  and  red  Chinese  designs  and
characters  It  was  a  venerable  object  of  mystery  which  I  soon  investigated
and found more fascinating inside than out The book was my fathers he read
in it often Once I saw him making notes from it and asked what he was doing
He said he was marking which chapters hed like to have read at his funeral
We did read those chapters at his memorial service

I have the book now ninetyeight years old and further ornamented with red
bindingtape to hold the back on and have marked which chapters Id like to
have read at my funeral In the Notes I explain why I was so lucky to discover
Lao  Tzu  in  that  particular  edition  Here  I  will  only  say  that  I  was  lucky  to
discover him so young so that I could live with his book my whole life long

I also discuss other aspects of my version in the Notesthe how of it Here

I want to state very briefly the why of it

The Tao Te Ching is partly in prose partly in verse but as we define poetry
now not by rhyme and meter but as a patterned intensity of language the whole
thing  is  poetry  I  wanted  to  catch  that  poetry  its  terse  strange  beauty  Most
translations  have  caught  meanings  in  their  net  but  prosily  letting  the  beauty
slip through And in poetry beauty is no ornament it is the meaning It is the
truth We have that on good authority

Scholarly  translations  of  the  Tao  Te  Ching  as  a  manual  for  rulers  use  a
vocabulary  that  emphasizes  the  uniqueness  of  the  Taoist  sage  his
masculinity his authority This language is perpetuated and degraded in most
popular  versions  I  wanted  a  Book  of  the  Way  accessible  to  a  presentday
unwise unpowerful and perhaps unmale reader not seeking esoteric secrets

but listening for a voice that speaks to the soul I would like that reader to see
why people have loved the book for twentyfive hundred years

It  is  the  most  lovable  of  all  the  great  religious  texts  funny  keen  kind
modest indestructibly outrageous and inexhaustibly refreshing Of all the deep
springs this is the purest water To me it is also the deepest spring

Ursula K Le Guin

Commentaries at the foot of some of the chapters are my own responses to the
text They are idiosyncratic and unscholarly and are to be ignored if not found
helpful In the Notes at the end of the book are more detailed considerations of
some of the chapters thanks to my sources and guides and remarks on how I
arrived at my version

BOOK ONE



Taoing

The way you can go
isnt the real way
The name you can say
isnt the real name

Heaven and earth
begin in the unnamed
names the mother
of the ten thousand things

So the unwanting soul
sees whats hidden
and the everwanting soul
sees only what it wants

Two things one origin
but different in name
whose identity is mystery
Mystery of all mysteries
The door to the hidden

A satisfactory translation of this chapter is I believe perfectly impossible It
contains the book I think of it as the Aleph in Borgess story if you see it
rightly it contains everything



Soul food

Everybody on earth knowing
that beauty is beautiful
makes ugliness

Everybody knowing
that goodness is good
makes wickedness

For being and nonbeing
arise together
hard and easy
complete each other
long and short
shape each other
high and low
depend on each other
note and voice
make the music together
before and after
follow each other

Thats why the wise soul
does without doing
teaches without talking

The things of this world
exist they are
you cant refuse them

To bear and not to own

to act and not lay claim
to do the work and let it go
for just letting it go
is what makes it stay

One of the things I read in this chapter is that values and beliefs are not only
culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang the great
reversals  that  maintain  the  living  balance  of  the  world  To  believe  that  our
beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance To let
go of that belief is to find safety



Hushing

Not praising the praiseworthy
keeps people uncompetitive

Not prizing rare treasures
keeps people from stealing

Not looking at the desirable
keeps the mind quiet

So the wise soul
governing people
would empty their minds
fill their bellies
weaken their wishes
strengthen their bones

keep people unknowing
unwanting
keep the ones who do know
from doing anything

When you do notdoing
nothings out of order

Over and over Lao Tzu says wei wu wei Do not do Doing notdoing To act
without acting Action by inaction You do nothing yet it gets done   

Its  not  a  statement  susceptible  to  logical  interpretation  or  even  to  a
syntactical translation  into  English  but  its a  concept  that  transforms  thought

radically  that  changes  minds  The  whole  book  is  both  an  explanation  and  a
demonstration of it



Sourceless

The way is empty
used but not used up
Deep yes ancestral
to the ten thousand things

Blunting edge
loosing bond
dimming light
the way is the dust of the way

Quiet
yes and likely to endure
Whose child born
before the gods

Everything  Lao  Tzu  says  is  elusive  The  temptation  is  to  grasp  at  something
tangible in the endlessly deceptive simplicity of the words Even some of his
finest scholarly translators focus on positive ethical or political values in the
text as if those were whats important in it And of course the religion called
Taoism is full of gods saints miracles prayers rules methods for securing
riches power longevity and so forthall the stuff that Lao Tzu says leads us
away from the Way

In  passages  such  as  this  one  I  think  it  is  the  profound  modesty  of  the
language that offers what so many people for so many centuries have found in
this book a pure apprehension of the mystery of which we are part



Useful emptiness

Heaven and earth arent humane
To them the ten thousand things
are straw dogs

Wise souls arent humane
To them the hundred families
are straw dogs

Heaven and earth
act as a bellows

Empty yet structured
it moves inexhaustibly giving

The  inhumanity  of  the  wise  soul  doesnt  mean  cruelty  Cruelty  is  a  human
characteristic  Heaven  and  earththat  is  Nature  and  its  Wayare  not
humane  because  they  are  not  human  They  are  not  kind  they  are  not  cruel
those  are  human  attributes  You  can  only  be  kind  or  cruel  if  you  have  and
cherish a self You cant even be indifferent if you arent different Altruism is
the other side of egoism Followers of the Way like the forces of nature act
selflessly



What is complete

The valley spirit never dies
Call it the mystery the woman

The mystery
the Door of the Woman
is the root
of earth and heaven

Forever this endures forever
And all its uses are easy



Dim brightness

Heaven will last
earth will endure
How can they last so long
They dont exist for themselves
and so can go on and on

So wise souls
leaving self behind
move forward
and setting self aside
stay centered
Why let the self go
To keep what the soul needs



Easy by nature

True goodness
is like water
Waters good
for everything
It doesnt compete

It goes right
to the low loathsome places
and so finds the way

For a house
the good thing is level ground
In thinking
depth is good
The good of giving is magnanimity
of speaking honesty
of government order
The good of work is skill
and of action timing

No competition
so no blame

A clear stream of water runs through this book from poem to poem wearing
down the indestructible finding the way around everything that obstructs the
way Good drinking water



Being quiet

Brimfill the bowl
itll spill over
Keep sharpening the blade
youll soon blunt it

Nobody can protect
a house full of gold and jade

Wealth status pride
are their own ruin
To do good work well and lie low
is the way of the blessing



Techniques

Can you keep your soul in its body
hold fast to the one
and so learn to be whole
Can you center your energy
be soft tender
and so learn to be a baby

Can you keep the deep water still and clear
so it reflects without blurring
Can you love people and run things
and do so by not doing

Opening closing the Gate of Heaven
can you be like a bird with her nestlings
Piercing bright through the cosmos
can you know by not knowing

To give birth to nourish
to bear and not to own
to act and not lay claim
to lead and not to rule
this is mysterious power

Most of the scholars think this chapter is about meditation its techniques and
fulfillments The language is profoundly mystical the images are charged rich
in implications

The last verse turns up in nearly the same words in other chapters there are

several such refrains throughout the book identical or similar lines repeated
once or twice or three times



The uses of not

Thirty spokes
meet in the hub
Where the wheel isnt
is where its useful

Hollowed out
clay makes a pot
Where the pots not
is where its useful

Cut doors and windows
to make a room
Where the room isnt
theres room for you

So the profit in what is
is in the use of what isnt

One  of  the  things  I  love  about  Lao  Tzu  is  he  is  so  funny  Hes  explaining  a
profound and difficult truth here one of those counterintuitive truths that when
the mind can accept them suddenly double the size of the universe He goes
about it with this deadpan simplicity talking about pots



Not wanting

The five colors
blind our eyes
The five notes
deafen our ears
The five flavors
dull our taste

Racing chasing hunting
drives people crazy
Trying to get rich
ties people in knots

So the wise soul
watches with the inner
not the outward eye
letting that go
keeping this



Shameless

To be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear
To take the body seriously
is to admit one can suffer

What does that mean
to be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear
Favor debases
we fear to lose it
fear to win it
So to be in favor or disgrace
is to live in fear

What does that mean
to take the body seriously
is to admit one can suffer
I suffer because Im a body
if I werent a body
how could I suffer

So people who set their bodily good
before the public good
could be entrusted with the commonwealth
and people who treated the body politic
as gently as their own body
would be worthy to govern the commonwealth

Autocracy and  oligarchy  foster  the  beliefs that  power  is  gained  magically
and retained by sacrifice and that powerful people are genuinely superior to
the powerless

Lao Tzu does not see political power as magic He sees rightful power as
earned and wrongful power as usurped He does not see power as virtue but
as the result of virtue The democracies are founded on that view

Lao Tzu a mystic demystifies political power

He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power and power as
available  to  anybody  who  follows  the  Way  This  is  a  radically  subversive
attitude No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends



Celebrating mystery

Look at it nothing to see
Call it colorless
Listen to it nothing to hear
Call it soundless
Reach for it nothing to hold
Call it intangible

Triply undifferentiated
it merges into oneness
not bright above
not dark below

Never oh never
can it be named
It reverts it returns
to unbeing
Call it the form of the unformed
the image of no image

Call it unthinkable thought
Face it no face
Follow it no end

Holding fast to the old Way
we can live in the present
Mindful of the ancient beginnings
we hold the thread of the Tao



People of power

Once upon a time
people who knew the Way
were subtle spiritual mysterious penetrating
unfathomable

Since theyre inexplicable
I can only say what they seemed like
Cautious oh yes as if wading through a winter river
Alert as if afraid of the neighbors
Polite and quiet like houseguests
Elusive like melting ice
Blank like uncut wood
Empty like valleys
Mysterious oh yes they were like troubled water

Who can by stillness little by little
make what is troubled grow clear
Who can by movement little by little
make what is still grow quick

To follow the Way
is not to need fulfillment
Unfulfilled one may live on
needing no renewal

In  the  first  stanza  we  see  the  followers  of  the  Way  in  ancient  times  or  illo
tempore remote and inaccessible but the second stanza brings them close and

alive in a series of marvelous similes I am particularly fond of the polite and
quiet houseguests The images of the valley and of uncut or uncarved wood
will recur again and again



Returning to the root

Be completely empty Be perfectly serene
The ten thousand things arise together
in their arising is their return
Now they flower
and flowering
sink homeward
returning to the root

The return to the root
is peace
Peace to accept what must be
to know what endures
In that knowledge is wisdom
Without it ruin disorder

To know what endures
is to be openhearted
magnanimous
regal
blessed
following the Tao
the way that endures forever
The body comes to its ending
but there is nothing to fear

To  those  who  will  not  admit  morality  without  a  deity  to  validate  it  or
spirituality of which man is not the measure the firmness of Lao Tzus morality

and  the  sweetness  of  his  spiritual  counsel  must  seem  incomprehensible  or
illegitimate or very troubling indeed



Acting simply

True leaders
are hardly known to their followers
Next after them are the leaders
the people know and admire
after them those they fear
after them those they despise

To give no trust
is to get no trust

When the works done right
with no fuss or boasting
ordinary people say
Oh we did it

This invisible leader who gets things done in such a way that people think they
did it all themselves isnt one who manipulates others from behind the scenes
just the opposite Again its a matter of doing without doing uncompetitive
unworried  trustful  accomplishment  power  that  is  not  force  An  example  or
analogy might be a very good teacher or the truest voice in a group of singers



Second bests

In the degradation of the great way
come benevolence and righteousness
With the exaltation of learning and prudence
comes immense hypocrisy
The disordered family
is full of dutiful children and parents
The disordered society
is full of loyal patriots



Raw silk and uncut wood

Stop being holy forget being prudent
itll be a hundred times better for everyone
Stop being altruistic forget being righteous
people will remember what family feeling is
Stop planning forget making a profit
there wont be any thieves and robbers

But even these three rules
neednt be followed what works reliably
is to know the raw silk
hold the uncut wood
Need little
want less
Forget the rules
Be untroubled

This  chapter  and  the  two  before  it  may  be  read  as  a  single  movement  of
thought

Raw silk and uncut wood are images traditionally associated with the

characters su simple plain and pu natural honest



Being different

How much difference between yes and no
What difference between good and bad

What the people fear
must be feared
O desolation
Not yet not yet has it reached its limit

Everybodys cheerful
cheerful as if at a party
or climbing a tower in springtime
And here I sit unmoved
clueless like a child
a baby too young to smile

Forlorn forlorn
Like a homeless person
Most people have plenty
Im the one thats poor
a fool right through

Ignorant ignorant
Most people are so bright
Im the one thats dull
Most people are so keen
I dont have the answers
Oh Im desolate at sea
adrift without harbor

Everybody has something to do

Im the clumsy one out of place
Im the different one
for my food
is the milk of the mother

The  difference  between  yes  and  no  good  and  bad  is  something  only  the
bright people the people with the answers can understand A poor stupid
Taoist cant make it out

This  chapter  is  full  of  words  like  huang  wild  barren  famine  tun
ignorant  chaotic  hun  dull  turbid  men  sad  puzzled  mute  and  hu
confused  obscured  vague  They  configure  chaos  confusion  a
bewilderness  in  which  the  mind  wanders  without  certainties  desolate
silent  awkward  But  in  that  milky  dim  strangeness  lies  the  way  It  cant  be
found in the superficial order imposed by positive and negative opinions the
goodbad yesno moralizing that denies fear and ignores mystery



The empty heart

The greatest power is the gift
of following the Way alone
How the Way does things
is hard to grasp elusive
Elusive yes hard to grasp
yet there are thoughts in it
Hard to grasp yes elusive
yet there are things in it
Hard to make out yes and obscure
yet there is spirit in it
veritable spirit
There is certainty in it
From long long ago till now
it has kept its name
So it saw
the beginning of everything

How do I know
anything about the beginning
By this

Mysticism rises from and returns to the irreducible unsayable reality of this
This is the Way This is the way



Growing downward

Be broken to be whole
Twist to be straight
Be empty to be full
Wear out to be renewed
Have little and gain much
Have much and get confused

So wise souls hold to the one
and test all things against it

Not showing themselves
they shine forth
Not justifying themselves
theyre selfevident
Not praising themselves
theyre accomplished
Not competing
they have in all the world no competitor

What they used to say in the old days
Be broken to be whole
was that mistaken
Truly to be whole
is to return



Nothing and not

Nature doesnt make long speeches
A whirlwind doesnt last all morning
A cloudburst doesnt last all day
Who makes the wind and rain
Heaven and earth do
If heaven and earth dont go on and on
certainly people dont need to

The people who work with Tao
are Tao people
they belong to the Way
People who work with power
belong to power
People who work with loss
belong to whats lost

Give yourself to the Way
and youll be at home on the Way
Give yourself to power
and youll be at home in power
Give yourself to loss
and when youre lost youll be at home

To give no trust
is to get no trust



Proportion

You cant keep standing on tiptoe
or walk in leaps and bounds
You cant shine by showing off
or get ahead by pushing
Selfsatisfied people do no good
selfpromoters never grow up

Such stuff is to the Tao
as garbage is to food
or a tumor to the body
hateful
The follower of the Way
avoids it



Imagining mystery

There is something
that contains everything
Before heaven and earth
it is
Oh it is still unbodied
all on its own unchanging

allpervading
evermoving
So it can act as the mother
of all things
Not knowing its real name
we only call it the Way

If it must be named
let its name be Great
Greatness means going on
going on means going far
and going far means turning back

So they say The Way is great
heaven is great
earth is great
and humankind is great
four greatnesses in the world
and humanity is one of them

People follow earth
earth follows heaven

heaven follows the Way
the Way follows what is

Id  like  to  call  the  something  of  the  first  line  a  lumpan  unshaped
undifferentiated  lump  chaos  before  the  Word  before  Form  before  Change
Inside it is time space everything in the womb of the Way

The last words of the chapter tzu jan I render as what is I was tempted
to say The Way follows itself because the Way is the way things are but
that would reduce the significance of the words They remind us not to see the
Way as a sovereignty or a domination all creative all yang The Way itself is a
follower Though it is before everything it follows what is



Power of the heavy

Heavy is the root of light
Still is the master of moving

So wise souls make their daily march
with the heavy baggage wagon

Only when safe
in a solid quiet house
do they lay care aside

How can a lord of ten thousand chariots
let his own person
weigh less in the balance than his land
Lightness will lose him his foundation
movement will lose him his mastery

I  take  heaviness  to  be  the  root  matters  of  daily  life  the  baggage  we  bodily
beings have to carry such as food drink shelter safety If you go charging too
far ahead of the baggage wagon you may be cut off from it if you treat your
body as unimportant you risk insanity or inanity

The first two lines would make a nice motto for the practice of Tai Chi



Skill

Good walkers leave no track
Good talkers dont stammer
Good counters dont use their fingers
The best doors unlocked and unopened
The best knots not in a rope and cant be untied

So wise souls are good at caring for people
never turning their back on anyone
Theyre good at looking after things
never turning their back on anything
Theres a light hidden here

Good people teach people who arent good yet
the less good are the makings of the good
Anyone who doesnt respect a teacher
or cherish a student
may be clever but has gone astray
Theres a deep mystery here

The hidden light and the deep mystery seem to be signals saying think about
thisabout care for what seems unimportant In a teachers parental care for
the insignificant student and in a societys respect for mothers teachers and
other  obscure  people  who  educate  there  is  indeed  illumination  and  a
profoundly  human  mystery  Having  replaced  instinct  with  language  society
and culture we are the only species that depends on teaching and learning We
arent human without them In them is true power But are they the occupations
of the rich and mighty



Turning back

Knowing man
and staying woman
be the riverbed of the world
Being the worlds riverbed
of eternal unfailing power
is to go back again to be newborn

Knowing light
and staying dark
be a pattern to the world
Being the worlds pattern
of eternal unerring power
is to go back again to boundlessness

Knowing glory
and staying modest
be the valley of the world
Being the worlds valley
of eternal inexhaustible power
is to go back again to the natural

Natural wood is cut up
and made into useful things
Wise souls are used
to make into leaders
Just so a great carving
is done without cutting

The  simplicity  of  Lao  Tzus  language  can  present  an  almost  impenetrable
density  of  meaning  The  reversals  and  paradoxes  in  this  great  poem  are  the
oppositions of the yin and yangmalefemale lightdark glorymodestybut
the knowing and being of them the balancing act results in neither stasis nor
synthesis The riverbed in which power runs leads back the patterns of power
lead  back  the  valley  where  power  is  contained  leads  backto  the  forever
new  endless  straightforward  way  Reversal  recurrence  are  the  movement
and yet the movement is onward



Not doing

Those who think to win the world
by doing something to it
I see them come to grief
For the world is a sacred object
Nothing is to be done to it
To do anything to it is to damage it
To seize it is to lose it

Under heaven some things lead some follow
some blow hot some cold
some are strong some weak
some are fulfilled some fail

So the wise soul keeps away
from the extremes excess extravagance

For  Lao  Tzu  moderation  in  all  things  isnt  just  a  bit  of  safe  practical
advice To lose the sense of the sacredness of the world is a mortal loss To
injure our world by excesses of greed and ingenuity is to endanger our own
sacredness



Not making war

A Taoist wouldnt advise a ruler
to use force of arms for conquest
that tactic backfires

Where the army marched
grow thorns and thistles
After the war
come the bad harvests
Good leaders prosper thats all
not presuming on victory
They prosper without boasting
or domineering or arrogance
prosper because they cant help it
prosper without violence

Things flourish then perish
Not the Way
Whats not the Way
soon ends

This first direct statement of Lao Tzus pacifism is connected in thought to the
previous poem and leads directly to the next

The  last  verse  is  enigmatic  Things  flourish  then  perishHow  can  this
supremely natural sequence not be the Way I offer my understanding of it in
the note on the page with chapter  where nearly the same phrase occurs



Against war

Even the best weapon
is an unhappy tool
hateful to living things
So the follower of the Way
stays away from it

Weapons are unhappy tools
not chosen by thoughtful people
to be used only when there is no choice
and with a calm still mind
without enjoyment
To enjoy using weapons
is to enjoy killing people
and to enjoy killing people
is to lose your share in the common good

It is right that the murder of many people
be mourned and lamented
It is right that a victor in war
be received with funeral ceremonies



Sacred power

The way goes on forever nameless
Uncut wood nothing important
yet nobody under heaven
dare try to carve it
If rulers and leaders could use it
the ten thousand things
would gather in homage
heaven and earth would drop sweet dew
and people without being ordered
would be fair to one another

To order to govern
is to begin naming
when names proliferate
its time to stop
If you know when to stop
youre in no danger

The Way in the world
is as a stream to a valley
a river to the sea

The second verse connects the uncut the uncarved the unusable to the idea of
the  unnamed  presented  in  the  first  chapter  names  the  mother  of  the  ten
thousand things You have to make order you have to make distinctions but
you  also  have  to  know  when  to  stop  before  youve  lost  the  whole  in  the
multiplicity of parts The simplicity or singleness of the Way is that of water

which always rejoins itself



Kinds of power

Knowing other people is intelligence
knowing yourself is wisdom
Overcoming others takes strength
overcoming yourself takes greatness
Contentment is wealth

Boldly pushing forward takes resolution
Staying put keeps you in position

To live till you die
is to live long enough



Perfect trust

The Great Way runs
to left to right
the ten thousand things
depending on it
living on it
accepted by it

Doing its work
it goes unnamed
Clothing and feeding
the ten thousand things
it lays no claim on them
and asks nothing of them
Call it a small matter
The ten thousand things
return to it
though it lays no claim on them
Call it great

So the wise soul
without great doings
achieves greatness



Humane power

Hold fast to the great thought
and all the world will come to you
harmless peaceable serene

Walking around we stop
for music for food
But if you taste the Way
its flat insipid
It looks like nothing much
it sounds like nothing much
And yet you cant get enough of it



The small dark light

What seeks to shrink
must first have grown
what seeks weakness
surely was strong
What seeks its ruin
must first have risen
what seeks to take
has surely given

This is called the small dark light
the soft the weak prevail
over the hard the strong

There is a third stanza in all the texts

Fish should stay underwater
the real means of rule
should be kept dark

Or  more  literally  the  States  sharp  weapons  ought  not  to  be  shown  to  the
people  This  Machiavellian  truism  seems  such  an  anticlimax  to  the  great
theme  stated  in  the  first  verses  that  I  treat  it  as  an  intrusion  perhaps  a
commentators practical example of the small dark light



Over all

The Way never does anything
and everything gets done
If those in power could hold to the Way
the ten thousand things
would look after themselves
If even so they tried to act
Id quiet them with the nameless
the natural

In the unnamed in the unshapen
is not wanting
In not wanting is stillness
In stillness all under heaven rests

Here the themes of not doing and not wanting the unnamed and the unshapen
recur  together  in  one  pure  legato  It  is  wonderful  how  by  negatives  and
privatives Lao Tzu gives a sense of serene inexhaustible fullness of being

BOOK Two



Talking about power

Great power not clinging to power
has true power
Lesser power clinging to power
lacks true power
Great power doing nothing
has nothing to do
Lesser power doing nothing
has an end in view

The good the truly good do
has no end in view
The right the very righteous do
has an end in view
And those who act in true obedience to law
roll up their sleeves
and make the disobedient obey

So when we lose the Way we find power
losing power we find goodness
losing goodness we find righteousness
losing righteousness were left with obedience

Obedience to law is the dry husk
of loyalty and good faith
Opinion is the barren flower of the Way
the beginning of ignorance

So greatminded people
abide in the kernel not the husk

in the fruit not the flower
letting the one go keeping the other

A vast dense argument in a minumum of words this poem lays out the Taoist
values in steeply descending order the Way and its power goodness humane
feeling  righteousness  morality  anda  very  distant  lastobedience  law
and  order  The  word  I  render  as  opinion  can  be  read  as  knowing  too
soon the mind obeying orders judging before the evidence is in closed to
fruitful perception and learning



Integrity

Those who of old got to be whole

Heaven through its wholeness is pure
earth through its wholeness is steady
spirit through its wholeness is potent
the valley through its wholeness flows with rivers
the ten thousand things through their wholeness live
rulers through their wholeness have authority
Their wholeness makes them what they are

Without what makes it pure heaven would disintegrate
without what steadies it earth would crack apart
without what makes it potent spirit would fail
without what fills it the valley would run dry
without what quickens them the ten thousand things would die
without what authorizes them rulers would fall

The root of the noble is in the common
the high stands on whats below
Princes and kings call themselves
orphans widowers beggars
to get themselves rooted in the dirt

A multiplicity of riches
is poverty
Jade is praised as precious
but its strength is being stone



By no means

Return is how the Way moves
Weakness is how the Way works

Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things
are born of being
Being is born of nothing



On and off

Thoughtful people hear about the Way
and try hard to follow it
Ordinary people hear about the Way
and wander onto it and off it
Thoughtless people hear about the Way
and make jokes about it
It wouldnt be the Way
if there werent jokes about it

So they say
The Ways brightness looks like darkness
advancing on the Way feels like retreating
the plain Way seems hard going
The height of power seems a valley
the amplest power seems not enough
the firmest power seems feeble
Perfect whiteness looks dirty
The pure and simple looks chaotic

The great square has no corners
The great vessel is never finished
The great tone is barely heard
The great thought cant be thought

The Way is hidden
in its namelessness
But only the Way
begins sustains fulfills



Children of the Way

The Way bears one
The one bears two
The two bear three
The three bear the ten thousand things
The ten thousand things
carry the yin on their shoulders
and hold in their arms the yang
whose interplay of energy
makes harmony

People despise
orphans widowers outcasts
Yet thats what kings and rulers call themselves
Whatever you lose youve won
Whatever you win youve lost

What others teach I say too
violence and aggression
destroy themselves
My teaching rests on that

Beginning with a pocket cosmology this chapter demonstrates the interplay of
energy of yin and yang by showing how low and high winning and losing
destruction  and  selfdestruction  reverse  themselves  each  turning  into  its
seeming opposite



Water and stone

Whats softest in the world
rushes and runs
over whats hardest in the world

The immaterial
enters
the impenetrable

So I know the good in not doing

The wordless teaching
the profit in not doing
not many people understand it



Fame and fortune

Which is nearer
name or self
Which is dearer
self or wealth
Which gives more pain
loss or gain

All you grasp will be thrown away
All you hoard will be utterly lost

Contentment keeps disgrace away
Restraint keeps you out of danger
so you can go on for a long long time



Real power

Whats perfectly whole seems flawed
but you can use it forever
Whats perfectly full seems empty
but you cant use it up

True straightness looks crooked
Great skill looks clumsy
Real eloquence seems to stammer

To be comfortable in the cold keep moving
to be comfortable in the heat hold still
to be comfortable in the world stay calm and clear



Wanting less

When the worlds on the Way
they use horses to haul manure
When the world gets off the Way
they breed warhorses on the common

The greatest evil wanting more
The worst luck discontent
Greeds the curse of life

To know enoughs enough
is enough to know



Looking far

You dont have to go out the door
to know what goes on in the world
You dont have to look out the window
to see the way of heaven
The farther you go
the less you know

So the wise soul
doesnt go but knows
doesnt look but sees
doesnt do but gets it done

We  tend  to  expect  great  things  from  seeing  the  world  and  getting
experience  A  Roman  poet  remarked  that  travelers  change  their  sky  but  not
their soul Other poets untraveled and inexperienced Emily Bront and Emily
Dickinson prove Lao Tzus point its the inner eye that really sees the world



Unlearning

Studying and learning daily you grow larger
Following the Way daily you shrink
You get smaller and smaller
So you arrive at not doing
You do nothing and nothings not done

To run things
dont fuss with them
Nobody who fusses
is fit to run things

The word shi in the second stanza my fuss is troublesome to the translators
Caruss quite legitimate translation of it is diplomacy which would give a
stanza I like very much

To run things
be undiplomatic
No diplomat
is fit to run things



Trust and power

The wise have no mind of their own
finding it in the minds
of ordinary people

Theyre good to good people
and theyre good to bad people
Power is goodness
They trust people of good faith
and they trust people of bad faith
Power is trust

They mingle their life with the world
they mix their mind up with the world
Ordinary people look after them
Wise souls are children

The next to last line is usually read as saying that ordinary people watch and
listen to wise people But Lao Tzu has already told us that most of us wander
on and off the Way and dont know a sage from a sandpile And surely the quiet
Taoist is not a media pundit

Similarly the last line is taken to mean that the wise treat ordinary people
like children This is patronizing and makes hash out of the first verse I read it
to  mean  that  the  truly  wise  are  looked  after  or  looked  upon  like  children
because  theyre  trusting  unprejudiced  and  dont  hold  themselves  above  or
apart from ordinary life



Love of life

To look for life
is to find death
The thirteen organs of our living
are the thirteen organs of our dying
Why are the organs of our life
where death enters us
Because we hold too hard to living

So Ive heard
if you live in the right way
when you cross country
you neednt fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger
when youre in a battle
you neednt fear the weapons
The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns
the tiger nowhere to stick its claws
the sword nowhere for its point to go
Why Because theres nowhere in you
for death to enter



Nature nurture

The Way bears them
power nurtures them
their own being shapes them
their own energy completes them
And not one of the ten thousand things
fails to hold the Way sacred
or to obey its power

Their reverence for the Way
and obedience to its power
are unforced and always natural
For the Way gives them life
its power nourishes them
mothers and feeds them
completes and matures them
looks after them protects them

To have without possessing
do without claiming
lead without controlling
this is mysterious power



Back to the beginning

The beginning of everything
is the mother of everything
Truly to know the mother
is to know her children
and truly to know the children
is to turn back to the mother
The body comes to its ending
but there is nothing to fear

Close the openings
shut the doors
and to the end of life
nothing will trouble you
Open the openings
be busy with business
and to the end of life
nothing can help you

Insight sees the insignificant
Strength knows how to yield
Use the ways light return to its insight
and so keep from going too far
Thats how to practice whats forever

This chapter on the themes of return and centering makes circles within itself
and throughout the book returning to phrases from other poems turning them
round the center A center which is everywhere a circle whose circumference

is infinite   



Insight

If my minds modest
I walk the great way
Arrogance
is all I fear

The great way is low and plain
but people like shortcuts over the mountains

The palace is full of splendor
and the fields are full of weeds
and the granaries are full of nothing

People wearing ornaments and fancy clothes
carrying weapons
drinking a lot and eating a lot
having a lot of things a lot of money
shameless thieves
Surely their way
isnt the way

So much for capitalism



The sign of the mysterious

Being full of power
is like being a baby
Scorpions dont sting
tigers dont attack
eagles dont strike
Soft bones weak muscles
but a firm grasp
Ignorant of the intercourse
of man and woman
yet the baby penis is erect
True and perfect energy
All day long screaming and crying
but never getting hoarse
True and perfect harmony

To know harmony
is to know whats eternal
To know whats eternal
is enlightenment
Increase of life is full of portent
the strong heart exhausts the vital breath
The fullgrown is on the edge of age
Not the Way
Whats not the Way soon dies

As a model for the Taoist the baby is in many ways ideal totally unaltruistic
not interested in politics business or the proprieties weak soft and able to

scream placidly for hours without wearing itself out its parents are another
matter The babys unawareness of poisonous insects and carnivorous beasts
means  that  such  dangers  simply  do  not  exist  for  it  Again  its  parents  are  a
different case

As a metaphor of the Tao the baby embodies the eternal beginning the ever
springing source We come trailing clouds of glory Wordsworth says and
Hopkins There lives the dearest freshness deep down things No Peter Pan
ish refusal to grow up is involved no hunt for the fountain of youth What is
eternal is forever young never grows old But we are not eternal

It is in this sense that I understand how the natural inevitable cycle of youth
growth mature vigor age and decay can be not the Way The Way is more
than  the  cycle  of  any  individual  life  We  rise  flourish  fail  The  Way  never
fails We are waves It is the sea



Some rules

Well planted is not uprooted
well kept is not lost
The offerings of the generations
to the ancestors will not cease

To follow the way yourself is real power
To follow it in the family is abundant power
To follow it in the community is steady power
To follow it in the whole country is lasting power
To follow it in the world is universal power

So in myself I see what self is
in my household I see what family is
in my town I see what community is
in my nation I see what a country is
in the world I see what is under heaven

How do I know the world is so
By this

I follow Waleys interpretation of this chapter It is Tao that plants and keeps
the various kinds of power belong to Tao and finally in myself I see the Tao of
self and so on



Mysteries of power

Who knows
doesnt talk
Who talks
doesnt know
Closing the openings
shutting doors

blunting edge
loosing bond
dimming light
be one with the dust of the way
So you come to the deep sameness

Then you cant be controlled by love
or by rejection
You cant be controlled by profit
or by loss
You cant be controlled by praise
or by humiliation
Then you have honor under heaven



Being simple

Run the country by doing whats expected
Win the war by doing the unexpected
Control the world by doing nothing
How do I know that
By this

The more restrictions and prohibitions in the world
the poorer people get
The more experts the country has
the more of a mess its in
The more ingenious the skillful are
the more monstrous their inventions
The louder the call for law and order
the more the thieves and con men multiply

So a wise leader might say
I practice inaction and the people look after themselves
I love to be quiet and the people themselves find justice
I dont do business and the people prosper on their own
I dont have wants and the people themselves are uncut wood

A strong political statement of the central idea of wu wei not doing inaction

My monstrous is literally new New is strange and strange is uncanny
New is bad Lao Tzu is deeply and firmly against changing things particularly
in the name of progress He would make an Iowa farmer look flighty I dont
think he is exactly antiintellectual but he considers most uses of the intellect
to be pernicious and all plans for improving things to be disastrous Yet hes

not  a  pessimist  No  pessimist  would  say  that  people  are  able  to  look  after
themselves be just and prosper on their own No anarchist can be a pessimist
Uncut  woodhere  likened  to  the  human  soulthe  uncut  unearned
unshaped unpolished native natural stuff is better than anything that can be
made out of it Anything done to it deforms and lessens it Its potentiality is
infinite Its uses are trivial



Living with change

When the governments dull and confused
the people are placid
When the governments sharp and keen
the people are discontented
Alas misery lies under happiness
and happiness sits on misery alas
Who knows where it will end
Nothing is certain

The normal changes into the monstrous
the fortunate into the unfortunate
and our bewilderment
goes on and on

And so the wise
shape without cutting
square without sawing
true without forcing
They are the light that does not shine

In the first verse the words dull and confused and sharp and keen are as
Waley points out the words used in chapter  to describe the Taoist and the
nonTaoists

In  the  last  verse  most  translators  say  the  Taoist  is  square  but  doesnt  cut
shines but doesnt dazzle Waley says that this misses the point The point is
that Taoists gain their ends without the use of means That is indeed a light that
does not shinean idea that must be pondered and brooded over A small dark

light



Staying on the way

In looking after your life and following the way
gather spirit
Gather spirit early
and so redouble power
and so become invulnerable

Invulnerable unlimited
you can do what you like with material things
But only if you hold to the Mother of things
will you do it for long
Have deep roots a strong trunk
Live long by looking long



Staying put

Rule a big country
the way you cook a small fish

If you keep control by following the Way
troubled spirits wont act up
They wont lose their immaterial strength
but they wont harm people with it
nor will wise souls come to harm
And so neither harming the other
these powers will come together in unity

Thomas Jefferson would have liked the first stanza

Troubled spirits are kwei ghosts not bad in themselves but dangerous if
they possess you Waley reads the second stanza as a warning to believers in
Realpolitik a ruler possessed by power harms both the people and his own
soul  Taking  it  as  counsel  to  the  individual  it  might  mean  that  wise  souls
neither indulge nor repress the troubled spirits that may haunt them rather they
let those spiritual energies be part of the power they find along the way



Lying low

The polity of greatness
runs downhill like a river to the sea
joining with everything
woman to everything

By stillness the woman
may always dominate the man
lying quiet underneath him

So a great country
submitting to small ones dominates them
so small countries
submitting to a great one dominate it

Lie low to be on top
be on top by lying low



The gift of the way

The way is the hearth and home
of the ten thousand things
Good souls treasure it
lost souls find shelter in it

Fine words are for sale
fine deeds go cheap
even worthless people can get them

So at the coronation of the Son of Heaven
when the Three Ministers take office
you might race out in a fourhorse chariot
to offer a jade screen
but wouldnt it be better to sit still
and let the Way be your offering

Why was the Way honored
in the old days
Wasnt it said
Seek youll find it
Hide it will shelter you
So it was honored under heaven

I think the line of thought throughout the poem has to do with true reward as
opposed to dishonorable gain true giving as opposed to fake goods



Consider beginnings

Do without doing
Act without action
Savor the flavorless
Treat the small as large
the few as many

Meet injury
with the power of goodness

Study the hard while its easy
Do big things while theyre small
The hardest jobs in the world start out easy
the great affairs of the world start small

So the wise soul
by never dealing with great things
gets great things done

Now since taking things too lightly makes them worthless
and taking things too easy makes them hard
the wise soul
by treating the easy as hard
doesnt find anything hard

Waley  says  that  this  charmingly  complex  chapter  plays  with  two  proverbs
Requite  injuries  with  good  deeds  is  the  first  The  word  te  here  meaning
goodness or good deeds is the same word Lao Tzu uses for the Power of the

Way Power is goodness he says in chapter  So having neatly annexed
the Golden Rule he goes on to the proverb about taking things too lightly and
plays paradox with it



Mindful of little things

Its easy to keep hold of what hasnt stirred
easy to plan what hasnt occurred
Its easy to shatter delicate things
easy to scatter little things
Do things before they happen
Get them straight before they get mixed up

The tree you cant reach your arms around
grew from a tiny seedling
The ninestory tower rises
from a heap of clay
The tenthousandmile journey
begins beneath your foot

Do and do wrong
Hold on and lose
Not doing the wise soul
doesnt do it wrong
and not holding on
doesnt lose it
In all their undertakings
its just as theyre almost finished
that people go wrong
Mind the end as the beginning
then it wont go wrong

Thats why the wise
want not to want
care nothing for hardwon treasures

learn not to be learned
turn back to what people overlooked
They go along with things as they are
but dont presume to act



One power

Once upon a time
those who ruled according to the Way
didnt use it to make people knowing
but to keep them unknowing

People get hard to manage
when they know too much
Whoever rules by intellect
is a curse upon the land
Whoever rules by ignorance
is a blessing on it
To understand these things
is to have a pattern and a model
and to understand the pattern and the model
is mysterious power

Mysterious power
goes deep
It reaches far
It follows things back
clear back to the great oneness

Where shall we find a ruler wise enough to know what to teach and what to
withhold Once upon a time maybe in the days of myth and legend as a
pattern a model an ideal

The knowledge and the ignorance or unknowing Lao Tzu speaks of may or
may not refer to what we think of as education In the last stanza by power he

evidently does not mean political power at all but something vastly different a
unity with the power of the Tao itself

This is a mystical statement about governmentand in our minds those two
realms  are  worlds  apart  I  cannot  make  the  leap  between  them  I  can  only
ponder it



Lowdown

Lakes and rivers are lords of the hundred valleys
Why Because theyll go lower
So theyre the lords of the hundred valleys

Just so a wise soul
wanting to be above other people
talks to them from below
and to guide them
follows them

And so the wise soul
predominates without dominating
and leads without misleading
And people dont get tired
of enjoying and praising
one who not competing
has in all the world
no competitor

One of the things I love in Lao Tzu is his good cheer as in this poem which
while giving good counsel is itself a praise and enjoyment of the spirit of yin
the  watersoul  that  yields  follows  eludes  and  leads  on  dancing  in  the
hundred valleys



Three treasures

Everybody says my way is great
but improbable

All greatness
is improbable
Whats probable
is tedious and petty

I have three treasures
I keep and treasure them
The first mercy
the second moderation
the third modesty
If youre merciful you can be brave
if youre moderate you can be generous
and if you dont presume to lead
you can lead the high and mighty

But to be brave without compassion
or generous without selfrestraint
or to take the lead
is fatal

Compassion wins the battle
and holds the fort
it is the bulwark set
around those heaven helps

The first two verses of this chapter are a joy to me

The  three  final  verses  are  closely  connected  in  thought  to  the  next  two
chapters which may be read as a single meditation on mercy moderation and
modesty on the use of strength on victory and defeat



Heavens lead

The best captain doesnt rush in front
The fiercest fighter doesnt bluster
The big winner isnt competing
The best boss takes a low footing
This is the power of noncompetition
This is the right use of ability
To follow heavens lead
has always been the best way



Using mystery

The expert in warfare says
Rather than dare make the attack
Id take the attack
rather than dare advance an inch
Id retreat a foot

Its called marching without marching
rolling up your sleeves without flexing your muscles
being armed without weapons
giving the attacker no opponent
Nothings worse than attacking what yields
To attack what yields is to throw away the prize

So when matched armies meet
the one who comes to grief
is the true victor

A piece of sound tactical advice practiced by the martial arts such as Aikido
and by underground resistance and guerrilla forces which leads to a profound
moral warning The prize thrown away by the aggressor is compassion The
yielder the griever the mourner keeps that prize The game is loser take all



Being obscure

My words are so easy to understand
so easy to follow

and yet nobody in the world
understands or follows them

Words come from an ancestry
deeds from a mastery
when these are unknown so am I

In my obscurity
is my value
Thats why the wise
wear their jade under common clothes



The sick mind

To know without knowing is best
Not knowing without knowing it is sick

To be sick of sickness
is the only cure

The wise arent sick
Theyre sick of sickness
so theyre well

What you know without knowing you know it is the right kind of knowledge
Any  other  kind  conviction  theory  dogmatic  belief  opinion  isnt  the  right
kind  and  if  you  dont  know  that  youll  lose  the  Way  This  chapter  is  an
example of exactly what Lao Tzu was talking about in the last oneobscure
clarity wellconcealed jade



The right fear

When we dont fear what we should fear
we are in fearful danger
We ought not to live in narrow houses
we ought not to do stupid work

If we dont accept stupidity
we wont act stupidly
So wise souls know but dont show themselves
look after but dont prize themselves
letting the one go keeping the other



Daring to do

Brave daring leads to death
Brave caution leads to life
The choice can be the right one
or the wrong one

Who will interpret
the judgment of heaven
Even the wise soul
finds it hard

The way of heaven
doesnt compete
yet wins handily
doesnt speak
yet answers fully
doesnt summon
yet attracts
It acts
perfectly easily

The net of heaven
is vast vast
widemeshed
yet misses nothing



The Lord of Slaughter

When normal decent people dont fear death
how can you use death to frighten them
Even when they have a normal fear of death
who of us dare take and kill the one who doesnt
When people are normal and decent and deathfearing
theres always an executioner
To take the place of that executioner
is to take the place of the great carpenter
People who cut the great carpenters wood
seldom get off with their hands unhurt

To Lao Tzu not to fear dying and not to fear killing are equally unnatural and
antisocial Who are we to forestall the judgment of heaven or nature to usurp
the  role  of  the  executioner  The  Lord  of  Slaughter  is  Waleys  grand
translation



Greed

People are starving
The rich gobble taxes
thats why people are starving

People rebel
The rich oppress them
thats why people rebel

People hold life cheap
The rich make it too costly
thats why people hold it cheap

But those who dont live for the sake of living
are worth more than the wealthseekers

How  many  hundreds  of  years  ago  was  this  book  written  And  yet  still  this
chapter must be written in the present tense



Hardness

Living people
are soft and tender
Corpses are hard and stiff
The ten thousand things
the living grass the trees
are soft pliant
Dead theyre dry and brittle

So hardness and stiffness
go with death
tenderness softness
go with life

And the hard sword fails
the stiff trees felled
The hard and great go under
The soft and weak stay up

In an age when hardness is supposed to be the essence of strength and even the
beauty of women is reduced nearly to the bone I welcome this reminder that
tanks and tombstones are not very adequate role models and that to be alive is
to be vulnerable



The bow

The Way of heaven
is like a bow bent to shoot
its top end brought down
its lower end raised up
It brings the high down
lifts the low
takes from those who have
gives to those who have not

Such is the Way of heaven
taking from people who have
giving to people who have not
Not so the human way
it takes from those who have not
to fill up those who have
Who has enough to fill up everybody
Only those who have the Way

So the wise
do without claiming
achieve without asserting
wishing not to show their worth



Paradoxes

Nothing in the world
is as soft as weak as water
nothing else can wear away
the hard the strong
and remain unaltered
Soft overcomes hard
weak overcomes strong
Everybody knows it
nobody uses the knowledge

So the wise say
By bearing common defilements
you become a sacrificer at the altar of earth
by bearing common evils
you become a lord of the world

Right words sound wrong



Keeping the contract

After a great enmity is settled
some enmity always remains
How to make peace
Wise souls keep their part of the contract
and dont make demands on others
People whose power is real fulfill their obligations
people whose power is hollow insist on their claims

The Way of heaven plays no favorites
It stays with the good

This  chapter  is  equally  relevant  to  private  relationships  and  to  political
treaties Its realistic morality is based on a mystical perception of the fullness
of the Way



Freedom

Let there be a little country without many people
Let them have tools that do the work of ten or a hundred
and never use them
Let them be mindful of death
and disinclined to long journeys
Theyd have ships and carriages
but no place to go
Theyd have armor and weapons
but no parades
Instead of writing
they might go back to using knotted cords
Theyd enjoy eating
take pleasure in clothes
be happy with their houses
devoted to their customs

Waley says this endearing and enduring vision can be understood in the past
present or future tense as the reader desires This is always true of the vision
of the golden age the humane society

Christian  or  Cartesian  dualism  the  division  of  spirit  or  mind  from  the
material  body  and  world  existed  long  before  Christianity  or  Descartes  and
was never limited to Western thought though it is the craziness or sickness
that many people under Western domination see in Western civilization Lao
Tzu thinks the materialistic dualist who tries to ignore the body and live in the
head and the religious dualist who despises the body and lives for a reward
in heaven are both dangerous and in danger So enjoy your life he says live
in your body you are your body where else is there to go Heaven and earth

are one As you walk the streets of your town you walk on the Way of heaven



Telling it true

True words arent charming
charming words arent true
Good people arent contentious
contentious people arent good
People who know arent learned
learned people dont know

Wise souls dont hoard
the more they do for others the more they have
the more they give the richer they are
The Way of heaven profits without destroying
Doing without outdoing
is the Way of the wise

The next little country might be so close
the people could hear cocks crowing
and dogs barking there
but theyd get old and die
without ever having been there

NOTES

Concerning This Version

This  is  a  rendition  not  a  translation  I  do  not  know  any  Chinese  I  could
approach the text at all only because Paul Carus in his  translation of the
Tao  Te  Ching  printed  the  Chinese  text  with  each  character  followed  by  a
transliteration and a translation My gratitude to him is unending

To have the text thus made accessible was not only to have a Rosetta Stone
for the book itself but also to have a touchstone for comparing other English
translations one with another If I could focus on which word the translators
were interpreting I could begin to understand why they made the choice they
did  I  could  compare  various  interpretations  and  see  why  they  varied  so
tremendously  could  see  how  much  explanation  sometimes  how  much  bias
was included in the translation could discover for myself that several English
meanings might lead me back to the same Chinese word And finally for all
my ignorance of the language I could gain an intuition of the style the gait and
cadence of the original necessary to my ear and conscience if I was to try to
reproduce it in English

Without the access to the text that the Carus edition gave me I would have
been defeated by the differences among the translations and could never have
thought of following them as guides towards a version of my own As it was
working from Caruss text I learned how to let them lead me into it always
using  their  knowledge  their  scholarship  their  decisions  as  my  light  in
darkness

When you try to follow the Way even if you wander off it all the time good
things happen though you do not deserve them My work on the Tao Te Ching
was  very  wandering  indeed  I  started  in  my  twenties  with  a  few  chapters
Every decade or so Id do another bit and tell myself Id sit down and really
get to it some day The undeserved good thing that happened was that a true
and genuine scholar of ancient Chinese and of Lao Tzu Dr J P Seaton of the
University of North Carolina saw some of my versions of bits of the Tao Te

Ching scurvily quoted without attribution by myself He reprinted them with
honor and asked me for more I do not think he knew what he was getting into
Of his invaluable teaching his encouragement his generosity I can say only
what Lao Tzu says at the end of the book

Wise souls dont hoard
the more they do for others the more they have
the more they give the richer they are

Sources

Though  the  Tao  Te  Ching  has  been  translated  into  English  very  much  more
often than any other Chinese classic indeed almost overwhelmingly often it
wasnt  easy  to  get  hold  of  more  than  a  few  of  these  versions  until  quite
recently

Caruss  wordforword  ChinesetoEnglish  was  endlessly  valuable  to  me
but his actual translation wasnt very satisfactory Reason as a translation of
Tao did not ring true I always looked at any translation of the book I found and
had a go at it The language of some was so obscure as to make me feel the
book must be beyond Western comprehension James Legges version was one
of these though I did find the title for a book of mine The Lathe of Heaven in
Legge Years later Joseph Needham the great scholar of Chinese science and
technology  wrote  to  tell  me  in  the  kindest  most  unreproachful  fashion  that
Legge was a bit off on that one when Chuang Tzu was written the lathe hadnt
been invented

Listed  roughly  in  the  order  of  their  usefulness  to  me  these  are  the
translations  that  I  collected  over  the  years  and  came  to  trust  in  one  way  or
another and to use as my exemplars and guides

Witter Bynner The Way of Life According to Lao Tzu Capricorn Books 
In  the  dedication  to  his  friend  Kiang  Kanghu  Bynner  quotes  him  It  is
impossible to translate it without an interpretation Most of the translations
were based on the interpretations of commentators but you chiefly took its
interpretation from your own insight    so the translation could be very
close to the original text even without knowledge of the words This is
true of Bynners very free poetic American Version and its truth helped
give me the courage to work on my own American Version fifty years later
I did not refer often to Bynner while I worked because his style is very
different from mine and his vivid language might have controlled my own
rather than freeing it But I am most grateful to him

I started out using translations by Stephen Mitchell and Chang Chungyuan but

found them not useful Since I began working seriously on this version so many
Tao Te Chings have appeared or reappeared that one begins to wonder if Lao
Tzu  has  more  translators  than  he  has  readers  I  have  looked  hopefully  into
many but none of the new versions seems to improve in any way on Waley
Henricks  Lau  or  FengEnglish  and  many  of  them  blur  the  language  into
dullness and vagueness Lao Tzu is toughminded He is tenderminded He is
never under any circumstances squashyminded By confusing mysticism with
imprecision  such  versions  betray  the  spirit  of  the  book  and  its  marvelously
pungent laconic beautiful language

Notes on Some Choices of Wording

For tao I mostly use Way sometimes way depending on context Way
in my text always represents the character tao

I consistently render the character te as power Virtue virtus vert in
its  old  sense  of  the  inherent  quality  and  strength  of  a  thing  or  person  is  far
closer to the mark but that sense is pretty well lost Applied obsessively to the
virginity or monogamy of women the word lost its own virtue When used of
persons it now almost always has a smirk or a sneer in it This is a shame Lao
Tzus Power is goodness makes precisely the identification we used to make
in the word virtue Power on the other hand is a powerful word almost a
manaword for us It is also a very slippery one with many connotations To
identify it with goodness takes a special Taoistic definition of it as a property
ofthe virtue ofthe Way

The  phrase  tien  hsia  literally  under  heaven  occurs  many  times
throughout the text More often than not I render it as the world It is often
translatable as the Empirewhich after all meant the world to Lao Tzus
contemporaries I avoid this in order to avoid historical specificity but often
tien  hsia  indubitably  means  ones  country  ones  land  as  in  chapter  
Elsewhere I call it the public good the commonwealth or the common good
and sometimes I render it literally

The phrase wan wuh occurring very frequently means the material world
all  beings  everything  I  often  use  the  traditional  literal  translation  the  ten
thousand  things  because  its  lively  and  concrete  but  at  times  I  say
everything or the things of this world

I use wise soul or the wise for the several words and phrases usually
rendered  as  Sage  Wise  Man  Saint  Great  Man  and  so  on  and  I  avoid  the
pronoun usually associated with these terms I wanted to make a version that
doesnt limit wisdom to males and doesnt give the impression that a follower
of the Tao has to be a professional fulltime HolierthanThou who lives up

above snowline Unimportant uneducated untrained men and women can be
wise souls I thought of using mensch

With  the  same  intention  I  often  use  the  plural  pronoun  where  other
translations use the singular to avoid unnecessary gendering and to keep from
suggesting  the  idea  of  uniqueness  singularity  I  appreciate  the  Chinese
language for making such choices available

Certain obscure passages and verses that change or obstruct the sense of the
poems may be seen as errors or interpolations by copyists I decided to eject
some of them My authority for doing so is nila poets judgment that this
doesnt belong here It takes nerve to drop a line that Waley has left in My
version is openly dependent on the judgment of the scholars But my aim was
to make aesthetic intellectual and spiritual sense and I felt that efforts to treat
material extraneous to the text as integral to it weaken its integrity Anyhow
rejects are discussed and printed in the commentary on the page with the poem
or in the Notes

The Titles of the Poems Carus is one of the few translators to use titles
they  are  in  both  his  Chinese  text  and  his  translation  I  follow  his  version
sometimes and sometimes invent my own

The Two Texts of the Tao Te Ching

We  now  have  two  versions  of  the  Tao  Te  Ching  the  texts  that  have  been
standard since the third century CE and the Ma wang tui texts of the midfirst
century CE not discovered till  They differ in many details but in only
one major respect the order of the two books that constitute the text

The  three  words  tao  te  ching  put  into  English  without  syntactical
connection  are  way  power  classic  The  usual  interpretation  gives  the
meaning of this title as something on the order of the classic text about the
way and its power The two books are titled in some versions Tao The
Way  and  Te  The  Power  I  personally  find  that  the  poems  do  not
consistently  reflect  that  division  of  subjectmatter  In  the  Ma  wang  tui  the
Power comes before the Way

I keep the standard order in which tao precedes te and the famous stanza
about the goable way and the namable name is the first chapter not the thirty
eighth  Where  there  are  differences  in  wording  I  follow  sometimes  the
standard text sometimes Robert G Henrickss translation of the Ma wang tui
whichever seemed more useful

Notes on the Chapters

CHAPTER 

Here for the words in the third verse that I render what it wants I use the
Ma wang tui text The words in the standard text mean boundaries or limits
or  outcomes  This  version  seems  to  follow  more  comprehensibly  from  the
preceding lines

And yet the idea of what can be delimited or made manifest is relevant In
the last verse the two whose identity is mystery may be understood to be the
hidden  the  unnameable  the  limitless  vision  of  the  freed  souland  the
manifest  the  nameable  the  field  of  vision  limited  by  our  wants  But  the
endlessness of all that is and the limitation of mortal bodily life are the same
and their sameness is the key to the door

CHAPTER 

As I said above in a few of the poems I leave out lines which I find weaken
the  coherence  of  the  text  to  the  point  that  I  believe  them  to  be  a  longago
readers marginal notes which got incorporated in later copyings My authority
for these omissions is strictly personal and aesthetic Here I omit the last two
lines Translations of them vary greatly my version is

Mere talk runs dry
Best keep to the center

CHAPTER 

There are times Lao Tzu sounds very like Henry David Thoreau but Lao Tzu
was  kinder  When  Thoreau  says  to  distrust  any  enterprise  that  requires  new
clothes I distrust him He is macho flaunting his asceticism Lao Tzu knows
that getting all entangled with the external keeps us from the eternal but see

chapter  he also understands that sometimes people like to get dressed up

CHAPTER 

Tien hsia under heaven ie the Empire or the world here I render it as
the public good the commonwealth and the body politic

J P Seaton comments When Lao Tzu mentions the Empire or all under
heaven he does so with the assumption that all his readers know that it is a
commonwealth  where  only  the  ruler  who  rules  by  virtue  of  virtue  alone  is
legitimate

CHAPTERS   AND 

Henricks considers these three chapters to belong together

The last two lines of  are usually printed as the first two lines of  but

Henricks thinks they belong here and I follow him

In  line  the words hsiao tzu are traditionally translated as filial piety
and paternal affection a Confucian ideal In that chapter Lao Tzu cites these
dutiful  families  as  a  symptom  of  social  disorder  But  in  chapter    line  
hsiao  tzu  appears  as  the  good  that  will  result  when  people  cease  being
moralistic Unable to reconcile these contradictory usages and feeling that Lao
Tzu  was  far  more  likely  to  use  Confucian  language  satirically  than
straightforwardly  I  fudged  the  translation  in  chapter    calling  it  family
feeling  Evidently  we  arent  the  only  society  or  generation  to  puzzle  over
what a family is and ought to be

Sometimes I translate the characters su and pu with such words as simple
natural Though the phrase the uncarved block has become familiar to many
yet  metaphor  may  distance  ideas  and  weaken  a  direct  statement  But
sometimes  as  here  I  use  the  traditional  metaphors  because  the  context  so
clearly implies knowing something as an artist knows her materials keeping
hold on something solid

CHAPTER 

The standard texts ask whats the difference between wei and o which might
be translated yes and yessir The Ma wang tui has wei and ho yes and

no This is parallel with the next line good and bad in the standard text
beautiful and ugly in the Ma wang tui Heres a case where the older text
surely is correct the later ones corrupt

In the first two lines of the second verse the Ma wang tui text is perfectly
clear A person whom everyone fears ought to be feared The standard text is
strange  obscure  What  the  people  fear  must  be  feared  Yet  the  next  lines
follow from it as they dont from the Ma wang tui and after much pondering I
followed the standard text

CHAPTER 

In the second verse the word shih loss gives trouble to all the translators
Waley  calls  it  the  reverse  of  the  power  and  inefficacy  and  Waleys
interpretations are never to be ignored All the same I decided to take it not as
the opposite of the Way and the power but as a kind of shadowWay Identify
yourself  with  loss  failure  the  obscure  the  unpossessible  and  youll  be  at
home even there

CHAPTER 

My version of the first four lines of the second verse doesnt follow any of the
scholarly  translations  and  is  quite  unjustified  but  at  least  unlike  them  it
makes sense without horrible verbal contortions

CHAPTER 

In all the texts the fourth verse reads

So they say The Way is great
heaven is great
earth is great
and the king is great
Four greatnesses in the world
and the king is one of them

Yet in the next verse which is the same series in reverse order instead of
the king its the people or humanity I think a Confucian copyist slipped

the king in The king garbles the sense of the poem and goes against the spirit
of the book I dethroned him

The last words of the chapter tzu jan which I render what is bear many
interpretations Waley translates them as the SelfSo glossing them as the
unconditioned or what is so of itself Henricks what is so on its own
Lau that which is naturally so GibbsCheng Nature FengEnglish what
is natural Lafargue things as they are I came out closest to Lafargue in this
case

CHAPTER 

I follow the Ma wang tui text for the third verse which fits the theme much
better than the nonsequitur standard text Amid fine sights they sit calm and
aloof The syntax of the Ma wang tui also clarifies the last verse relating it to
the last verse of chapter 

CHAPTER 

The first two lines of the third verse say that the notgood are the tzu  the
capital  Carus  or  the  charge  FengEnglish  or  the  stock  in  trade
Waley or the raw material Henricks of the good Lafargue has the less
excellent are material for the excellent and GibbsCheng mediocre people
have the potential to be good people The latter two interpretations seemed
the  most  useful  to  me  And  so  I  call  these  makings  this  raw  material  a
studentsomebody learning to be or know better

The last lines of the second and third verses are translated in wildly various
ways my hidden light and deep mystery are justified if as I believe Lao
Tzu  is  signaling  that  his  apparently  simple  statements  have  complex
implications and need thinking about Of course this is true of everything in the

CHAPTER 

The natural and natural wood are the same word pu which I talked about
in the note to chapter  Given the amount of cutting up and carving that goes
on  in  the  last  verse  which  seems  a  kind  of  footnote  to  the  first  three  we

really seem to be talking about wood

Chinese lends itself to puns and this last verse is rife with them Waley says
that chi useful things can mean vessels or vassals and chih can mean
carving  or  governing  A  great  government  wouldnt  chop  and  hack  at
human nature trying to make leaders out of sows ears But the paradox of the
last two lines surely exceeds any single interpretation

CHAPTER 

The phrase tien hsia occurs only in the first verse where I translate it the
world  I  begin  the  second  verse  with  the  literal  translation  of  it  under
heaven I wanted the phrase in the poem as a reminder that the world of these
extremesof  hot  and  cold  weakness  and  strength  gain  and  lossis  the
sacred object the place under heaven

CHAPTER 

I have omitted certain lines included by the translators who are my sources and
guides In all the texts the second verse begins

A courteous person
in peacetime honors the left
in wartime the right

And the last verse begins

In celebrations the left is the place of honor
in mourning the right is the place of honor
so lesser officers stand on the left
the generalissimo on the right
just as they would at a funeral

I  consider  these  passages  to  be  commentaries  or  marginal  glosses  that  got
copied into the text J P Seaton says What were once supports by analogy to
common ceremonial practice are now relevant only to the historian Here they
confuse the clear powerful statement that culminates in the last four lines The
confusion  already  existed  when  the  Ma  wang  tui  version  was  written  and

there seems to be no way of sorting it out now except by radical surgery

CHAPTER 

This  chapter  sounds  like  Polonius  incontrovertible  but  banal  until  the  last
verse which is a doozer Here are some other versions of the last six words
Sss erh pu wang che shou

Carus word for word Who dies  yet  not  perishes  theone  is
longlived immortal
Caruss  free  translation  One  who  may  die  but  does  not  perish  has  life
everlasting
Waley When one dies one is not lost there is no other longevity
FengEnglish To die but not to perish is to be eternally present
Henricks To die but not be forgottenthats true long life
Bynner Vitality cleaves to the marrow  Leaving death behind
Lafargue One who dies and does not perish is truly longlived
GibbsCheng One who dies yet still remains has longevity
Lau He who lives out his days has had a long life

Under J P Seatons guidance I finally came to feel that I had a handle on the
line and that Laus rendition was the most useful One thing is certain Lao Tzu
is  not  saying  that  immortality  or  even  longevity  is  desirable  The  religion
called Taoism has spent much imagination on ways to prolong life interminably
or gain immortality and the mythologized Lao Tzu was supposed to have run
Methuselah  a  close  race  but  the  Lao  Tzu  who  wrote  this  had  no  truck  with
such notions

CHAPTER 

Wei mingthis  phrase  in  the  first  line  of  the  second  verse  and  the  chapter
titleis tricky

Carus  word  for  word  the  secrets    explanation  Caruss  free
translation explanation ie enlightenment of the secret

FengEnglish perception of the nature of things
GibbsCheng wonderfully minute and obscure yet brilliant
Lafargue subtle clarity
Henricks subtle light
Bynner a man with insight
Waley dimming ones light

Ming  is  light  or  enlightenment  Waley  explains  that  wei  means  obscure
because very small and also obscure because dark I use this second meaning
to make an oxymoron

CHAPTER 

The words in the first verse I translate as the nameless the natural and in the
next verse as the unnamed the unshapen are the same four words wu ming
chih pu more literally the naturalness of the unnamed The unnamed is a
key phrase in the first chapter and elsewhere as is not wanting unwanting
Pu  is  the  natural  the  uncut  wood  or  as  Waley  glosses  it  here  uncarved
wood quality

CHAPTER 

The series here is of familiar Confucian principles jen li igood humane
humanhearted altruistic righteous moral ethical laws rites rules law
and order But Lao Tzu reverses and subverts the Confucian priorities

Chien  shih  in  the  fourth  verse  is  premature  knowledge  in  Carus  and
foreknowledge  in  Lau  Henricks  and  Waley  who  explains  it  as  part  of
Confucian  doctrine  Henricks  interprets  it  as  having  ones  mind  made  up
before  one  enters  a  new  situation  about  what  is  right  and  wrong  and
proper and acceptable and so on Prejudice that is or opinion Buddhists
and Taoists agree in having a very low opinion of opinion

CHAPTER 

Yi  one  the  one  unity  singleness  integrity  is  here  translated  as  whole
wholeness

Waley explains the last two verses as comments on the first three but their
relevance is pretty tenuous The last verse is very difficult and the translations
are various and ingenious Henricks reads the Ma wang tui text of the first two
lines of it as meaning too many carriages is the same as no carriage and I
picked up on the idea of multiplicity as opposed to the singleness or wholeness
spoken of in the first verses The meaning of the lines about jade seems to be
anybodys guess

CHAPTER 

I moved the line about perfect whiteness down to keep the three lines about
power together in parallel structure with the three lines about the Way In the
last line of the second verse and in chapters  and  I translate hsiang as
thought The word connotes form shape image idea Waley explains it as
the form which is formless the Tao which cant be taod

CHAPTER 

In the sixth line does the word fu mean carry on ones back or turn ones
back on Lafargue is the only translator I found that made the second choice I
dont follow him because I dont think the ten thousand things would or can
make the mistake of turning their backs on the yin to embrace only yang But a
great many of us do make that mistake which is why Lao Tzu keeps reminding
us  to  value  yin  the  soft  the  dark  the  weak  earth  water  the  Mother  the
Valley

Lafargues reading however lets the next stanza follow more coherently
orphans the bereaved the outcast are what we turn our backs on winning is
yang losing is yin Through loss we win   

The last stanza is uncharacteristic in its didactic tone and in assimilating the
teaching  to  a  tradition  Lao  Tzu  usually  cites  what  others  teach  only  to
dissociate himself from it I was inclined to dismiss it as a marginal note by
someone who was teaching and annotating the text But J P Seaton who does
teach the text persuaded me to keep it in the body of the poem saying Its a
message that for all its flat moralism does connect Taoism to Confucianism and
even to Buddhism with a single solid threadaverting a hundred holy wars if
nothing else

CHAPTER 

The  intense  succinct  beautiful  language  of  the  first  verses  of  a  poem  is
sometimes  followed  by  a  verse  or  two  in  a  more  didactic  tone  smaller  in
scope  and  far  more  prosaic  I  believe  some  of  these  verses  are  additions
comments  and  examples  copied  into  the  manuscripts  so  long  ago  that  they
became  holy  writ  They  usually  have  their  own  charm  and  validity  butas
here and in chapter  and other placesthey bring a tremendous statement
down  to  a  rather  commonplace  ending  But  then  Lao  Tzu  values  the
commonplace

CHAPTER 

The last line literally not do yet accomplish is a direct statement of one of
the  fundamental  themes  of  the  book  When  I  came  up  with  a  slightly  mealy
version of it doesnt do but its done J P Seaton reminded me that doing
without doing is doing not not doing

CHAPTER 

Shi my fuss Caruss diplomacy is translated by Lafargue as work by
Lau as meddling by Waley and FengEnglish as interference by Henricks
as concern by GibbsCheng as act for gain

CHAPTER 

Following  some  of  Caruss  interpretations  the  first  lines  of  the  third  verse
might be read Wise souls live in the world carefully handling it carefully
making  their  mind  universal  I  cant  make  much  sense  of  any  of  the  other
versions except Henrickss beautiful reading

As for the Sages presence in the world he is one with it
And with the world he merges his mind

CHAPTER 

Those who read shih yu san  as  thirteen  rather  than  as  three  out  of  ten

make better sense of the difficult first verse The thirteen companions of life
Waley Henricks which I translate organs may be physical the limbs and
passages and cavities of the bodyor physiopsychological the emotions and
sensations

My  mad  bull  occurs  variously  as  a  rhinoceros  and  a  wild  buffalo  The

idea seems to be a big irritable animal with horns

My live in the right way is literally take care of your life or hold on to
your  life  The  context  indicates  care  without  anxiety  holding  without
grasping  I  read  the  poem  as  saying  that  if  you  can  take  life  as  it  comes  it
doesnt come at you as your enemy Lao Tzus nowhere for death to enter
isnt a promise of invulnerability or immortality his concern is how to live
rightly how to live till you die

CHAPTER 

The last two lines of the first verse are the same as the last two lines of chapter
 I wonder if some of these repetitions were insertions by people studying
and copying the book who were reminded of one poem by another and noted
down the relevant lines They are indeed relevant here but they dont fit with
perfect  inevitability  as  they  do  in  chapter    This  is  of  course  a  purely
aesthetic judgment subject to destruction by scholarship at any moment

CHAPTER 

Gibbs and Cheng finding both the language and the message discordant with
the  teachings  of  Lao  Tzu  wont  even  discuss  this  chapter  Waleys  reading
saves  it  but  the  listing  self  family  community  country  empireworld  a
conventional series in ancient Chinese thought and the list of rules and results
is  uncharacteristically  mechanical  Though  he  uses  many  commonplaces
familiar phrases rhymed sayings and so on Lao Tzus thought and language
are usually more unconventional and unpredictable than this

CHAPTER 

Another repetition the first four lines of the second verse are the same as the
second  verse  of  chapter    They  carry  a  different  weight  here  I  vary  my

translation of them in the fourth line to make it connect to the next

Hsuan tung the deep sameness hsuan is deep or mysterious tung
is  variously  translated  identification  oneness  sameness  merging
leveling assimilation It is an important theme met with before in chapter


CHAPTER 

The phrase How do I know By this has become a kind of tag by its third
repetition but as Waley points out it still implies intuitive knowing beyond
reasonknowing the way

The  words  I  translate  experts  literally  mean  sharp  weapons  but  the
term  implies  pundits  knowitalls  I  was  tempted  to  say  smart  bombs
which is too cute and topical but which would certainly lead neatly to the next
lines

CHAPTER 

Waley points out that words in the last verse with such meanings as square
right angular are typical Confucian virtues Henricks remarks that all these
words  and  operations  refer  to  carpentry  The  verse  is  about  how  to  cut  the
uncut wood without cutting it

CHAPTER 

Se  my  gather  spirit  is  variously  translated  frugality  moderation
restraint being sparing or by Waley laying up a store Evidently the
core idea is that of saving

The  chapter  is  usually  presented  in  the  manualforprinces  mode  Waley
makes  sense  out  of  it  by  complex  technical  references  other  versions  make
only gleams of sense To persuade or coerce it into the personal mode meant a
more  radical  interpretation  than  I  usually  dare  attempt  but  Waleys  reading
which points to the symbology of the breath chi and the long look of the
meditator  gave  me  the  courage  to  try  Here  is  a  version  closer  to  the
conventional ones

In controlling people and serving heaven

its best to go easy
Going easy from the start
is to gather power from the start
and gathered power keeps you safe
Safe you can do what you like
Do what you like the countrys yours
If you can make the countrys Mother yours
youll last a long time
Youll have deep roots and a strong trunk
The way to live long is to look long

CHAPTER 

The first seven lines continue the themes of sameness or assimilation and of
being woman being water the uses of yin From there on the language
goes flat and may be interpolated commentary Theres an even feebler fourth
verse

A big country needs more people
A small one needs more room
Each can get what it needs
but the big one needs to lie low

Because the Ma  wang  tui  texts  are  older  one  longs  to  see  them  as  more
authentic  less  corrupt  But  though  they  are  invaluable  in  offering  variant
readings some of the variants may themselves be corruptions In this chapter
the  Ma  wang  tui  reads  Small  countries  submitting  to  a  great  one  are
dominated and in the next verse Some by lying low stay on top but some by
lying low stay on the bottom Both versions are truisms but the Ma wang tui
version isnt even a Taoistic truism

CHAPTER 

The first and last verses hang together the two middle verses are difficult and
rather incoherent Waley says the enigmatic second verse refers to sophists and
sages who went about selling their fine words to the highest bidder like our

pop gurus and TV pundits

CHAPTER 

I think the advice about being careful at the end of an undertaking was added
perhaps to balance the advice that the right time to act is before the beginning
It confuses the argument a bit and I put it in parentheses

The  line  I  give  as  turn  back  to  what  people  overlooked  is  rendered  by
Lafargue  as  turns  back  to  the  place  all  others  have  gone  on  from  Feng
English brings men back to what they have lost Henricks returns to what
the masses have passed by Waley turning all men back to the things they
have  left  behind  Each  version  brings  out  a  different  color  in  the  line  like
different lights on an opal

CHAPTER 

A  dictator  and  his  censors  might  all  too  easily  cite  from  this  chapter  A
democrat might agree that the more people know the harder they are for a ruler
to  governsince  the  more  they  know  the  better  they  are  at  governing
themselves  Anyone  might  agree  that  an  intellectual  agenda  pursued  without
realitychecking is indeed a curse upon the land From the divine right of kings
through  the  deadly  teachings  of  Hitler  and  Mao  to  the  mumbojumbo  of
economists government by theory has done endless ill But why is Lao Tzus
alternative to it a people kept in ignorance What kind of ignorance Ignorance
of what Lao Tzu may be signalling us to ask such questions when he speaks of
understanding these things

CHAPTER 

Waley is my guide to the interpretation of the second verse but I make very
free with the last two lines of it If they arent a rather vapid statement that one
should never underestimate ones foe they must follow from what went before
and lead to the extraordinary last verse It all comes down to the last line and
the word shwai Carus translates it as the weaker the more compassionate
and Bynner uses the word compassion Waley translates it as he who does
not  delight  in  war  Henricks  as  the  one  who  feels  grief  GibbsCheng  as

the one stung by grief FengEnglish as the underdog Lafargue as the one
in mourning A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief

CHAPTER 

I  follow  Henricks  in  choosing  the  Ma  wang  tui  text  which  has  a  double
negative  in  the  second  line  Most  other  texts  have  not  knowing  knowing  is
sickness

CHAPTER 

I  take  the  liberty  of  reading  this  chapter  as  a  description  of  what  we  we
ordinary  people  should  fear  The  usual  reading  is  in  the  manualforprinces
mode In that case what should be feared is the ruler the rightful authority
and  the  advice  that  follows  is  evidently  directed  to  that  ruler  Its  certainly
what William Blake would have told the oligarchs of the Industrial Revolution
who still control our lives

When people dont fear what should be feared
they are in fearful danger
Dont make them live in narrow houses
dont force them to do stupid work
When theyre not made stupid
they wont act stupidly

CHAPTER 

I  follow  the  Ma  wang  tui  text  but  make  very  free  with  the  word  Henricks
renders as constant in their behavior If I understand Henricks version it
says that if people were consistent in behaving normally and in fearing death
and  if  death  were  the  penalty  for  abnormal  behavior  nobody  would  dare
behave abnormally and so there would be no executions and no executioners
But this is not the case as Lao Tzu says there are times when even normal
people lose their normal fear of death So what is the poem about I read it as
saying that since we are inconsistent both in our behavior and in our fear of
death no person can rightfully take on the role of executioner and should leave

the death penalty to the judgment of heaven or nature

CHAPTER 

To dismiss this Utopia as simply regressivist or antitechnological is to miss
an interesting point These people have laborsaving machinery ships and land
vehicles  weapons  of  offense  and  defense  They  have  them  and  dont  use
them I interpret they arent used by them Were used our lives shaped and
controlled  by  our  machines  cars  planes  weaponry  bulldozers  computers
These Taoists dont surrender their power to their creations

The eleventh line however is certainly regressive if it says knotted cords
are to replace written literature history mathematics and so on It might be
read as saying its best not to externalize all our thinking and remembering as
we do in writing and reading but to keep it embodied to think and remember
with our bodies as well as our verbalizing brains

CHAPTER 

This last poem is selfreflexive wrapping it all up tight in the first verse then
opening out again to praise the undestructive uncompetitive generosity of the
spirit that walks on the Way

To my mind the best reason for following the Ma wang tui text in reversing
the  order  of  the  books  is  that  the  whole  thing  ends  with  a  chapter    that
provides  a  nobler  conclusion  than  this  one  But  if  you  reverse  the  order
chapter  turns up in the middle of the book and I simply cannot believe that
thats right That poem is a beginning It is the beginning
