 
The Prince 
by Niccolo Machiavelli 
 
To the great Lorenzo Di Piero De Medici 
 
Those who try to obtain the favourable attention of a prince are accustomed to come before him with the 
things that they value most or which they think the prince will most enjoy As a result one often sees 
expensive gifts such as horses weapons cloths of gold precious stones and similar ornaments presented 
to princes 
 
Desiring therefore to present myself with some proof of my devotion towards you I have found that the 
possession I value above all is the knowledge of the actions of great men This knowledge has been 
acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs and a continual study of history I have reflected on 
this long and carefully and I now send you these reflections presented in a small volume 
 
And although I consider this work unworthy of your attention nevertheless I trust that you will be kind 
enough to accept it The best gift I can offer you is the opportunity of understanding in the shortest time 
all that I have learnt in so many years and with so many troubles and dangers I have written the work in 
a simple and direct way so that it will be accepted not for its style but for the importance of the theme 
 
I do not agree with those who regard it as a presumption if a man of low and humble condition dares to 
discuss and criticise the concerns of princes Those who draw pictures place themselves below in the 
plain to understand the nature of the mountains and other high places and in order to understand the 
plains place themselves upon high mountains Similarly to understand the nature of the people one needs 
to be a prince and to understand princes one needs to be of the people 
 
Take then this little gift in the spirit in which I send it If it is carefully read and considered by you you 
will learn my extreme desire that you should attain that greatness which fortune and your other attributes 
promise And if my lord from the mountain top of your greatness you will sometimes turn your eyes to 
these lower regions you will see how undeservedly I suffer great and continued bad fortune 

 

 

THE PRINCE 

 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
HOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE 
ACQUIRED 
 
There are only two kinds of states republics or principalities 
 
Principalities are either hereditary where the family in control has been long established or they are new 
 
The new principalities are either entirely new as was Milan to Francesco Sforza or they are as it were 
members added to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them as was the kingdom of Naples 
to that of the King of Spain 
 
Such states thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince or to live in freedom They are 
acquired either by the military power of the prince himself or of others or else by fortune or by ability 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES 
 
I will leave out all discussion of republics and will address myself only to principalities In doing so I 
will keep to the order indicated above and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved 
 
There are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states particularly those long accustomed to the family 
of their prince than new ones The reason is that in such states it is sufficient only for the prince to 
maintain the customs of those who ruled before him and to deal carefully with circumstances as they 
arise In this way a prince of average powers can maintain himself in his state unless he loses it by some 
extraordinary and excessive force If he loses it in this way whenever anything unfortunate happens to the 
one who took it from him he will get it back 
 
We have in Italy for example the Duke of Ferrara who lasted against the attacks of the Venetians in 
 and those of Pope Julius in  only because he had been long established in his principality The 
hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend hence it happens that he will be more loved 
Unless extraordinary wickedness causes him to be hated it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be 
naturally well disposed towards him and the longer the duration of his rule the more likely that the 
memories and motives that encourage change are lost One change always increases the possibility of 
another 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES 
 
But the difficulties occur in a new principality particularly in mixed principalities where there is a new 
addition to an old state These difficulties arise chiefly from an inherent problem which is there in all new 
principalities People change their rulers willingly hoping to better themselves and this hope induces 

 

 

 
them to take up arms against their prince However they are deceiving themselves because they 
afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse This is partly a result of another natural 
and common necessity which is that those who have submitted to the new prince have to support his 
army and suffer infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition 
 
In this way you not only have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality but 
you also are not able to keep those friends who put you there because you cannot satisfy them in the way 
they expected You cannot take strong measures against them feeling bound to them For although one 
may be very strong in armed forces yet in entering a state one always needs the cooperation of the local 
people 
 
For these reasons Louis the Twelfth King of France quickly occupied Milan and as quickly lost it To 
turn him out the first time it only required Lodovicos own forces because those who had opened the 
gates to Louis finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit would not put up with the 
cruel treatment of the new prince It is very true that after acquiring rebellious states a second time they 
are not so lightly lost afterwards This is because the prince with little reluctance will take the 
opportunity of the rebellion to punish the rebels to clear out the suspects and to strengthen himself in the 
weakest places Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovicoto 
raise rebellions on the borders But to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the 
whole world against him 
 
Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time The general reasons for the 
first time have been discussed It remains to name those for the second and to see what resources the 
King of France had and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more 
securely in his acquisition  
 
New additions to an ancient state are either of the same country and language or they are not When they 
are it is easier to hold them especially when they have not been accustomed to selfgovernment To hold 
them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them because the 
two peoples preserving in other things the old conditions and not being unlike in customs will live 
quietly together This can be seen in Brittany Burgundy Gascony and Normandy which have been 
bound to France a very long time Although there may be some difference in language nevertheless the 
customs are alike and the people are easily able to get on amongst themselves The prince who wishes to 
hold such additions has only to bear in mind two considerations first that the family of their former 
prince is destroyed and second that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered so that in a very short 
time they will become entirely integrated in the old principality 
 
But when states are acquired in a country differing in language customs or laws there are difficulties 
and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them One of the most positive moves would be for 
the prince to go and reside there This would make his position more secure Because if one is there 
problems are seen as they spring up and one can quickly remedy them But if one is not at hand the 
problems are heard of only when they are great and then one can no longer remedy them Besides this 
the country is not exploited by officials and the subjects are satisfied by easy access to the prince Thus 
wishing to be good they have more cause to love him and wishing to be otherwise to fear him He who 
would attack that state from the outside must have the greatest caution As long as the prince resides there 
it can only be taken from him with the greatest difficulty 
 
The other and better course is to establish settlements colonies in one or two places which will tie the 

 

 

 
state to you If you do not do this you will have to keep part of your army there A prince does not have 
to spend much on such settlements for with little or no expense he can send the settlers there and keep 
them there He offends only a minority of the citizens from whom he takes land and houses to give to the 
new settlers Those whom he offends remaining poor and scattered are never able to injure him while 
the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet and at the same time are anxious not to cause trouble in case 
they lose their land and houses In conclusion I say that these settlements are not costly they are more 
faithful they injure less and the injured as has been said being poor and scattered cannot hurt 
However one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed because they can revenge 
themselves of lighter injuries but of more serious ones they cannot Therefore the injury that is to be done 
to someone ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge 
 
However if instead of settlements the prince maintains armed men there one spends much more having 
to spend on the military presence all the income from the state Then the acquisition turns into a loss and 
many more are upset because the whole state is injured Through having to shift the soldiers from one 
place to another all experience hardship and all become hostile They become enemies who while 
beaten on their own ground are yet able to do hurt For every reason therefore such guards are as useless 
as a settlement is useful 
 
The prince who holds a country differing in language customs and law ought to make himself the head 
and defender of his less powerful neighbours He should weaken the more powerful amongst them taking 
care that no foreigner as powerful as himself shall by any accident get established there It will always 
happen that some powerful foreigner will be invited in by those who are unhappy with the prince either 
through excess of ambition or through fear The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians and 
in every other country where they established themselves they were brought in by the local people The 
usual course of affairs is that as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country all the subject states are 
drawn to him moved by the hatred which they feel against the existing prince So the foreigner does not 
to have any trouble winning them over to himself for all of them quickly support the state which he has 
acquired there He has only to take care that they do not get hold of too much power and too much 
authority Then with his own forces and with their cooperation he can easily keep down the more 
powerful of them so as to remain entirely master in the country If this business is not properly managed 
he will soon lose what he has acquired and while he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and 
troubles 
 
The Romans in the countries which they took over closely followed these principles They sent 
settlements and maintained friendly relations with the minor powers without increasing the strength of 
the minor powers They kept down the greater states and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain 
authority  Thus the Romans did in these instances what all careful princes ought to do who have to 
regard not for only present troubles but also for future ones When problems are noted before they occur 
it is easy to remedy them But if you wait until they approach the medicine is too late because the illness 
has become incurable Thus doctors say that the beginning of a severe fever is easy to cure but difficult to 
detect In the course of time not having been either detected or treated in the beginning it becomes easy 
to detect but difficult to cure This also happens in affairs of state for when the evils that arise have been 
predicted which only wise men can do they can be quickly dealt with But when through not having 
been predicted they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them there is no longer 
a remedy Therefore the Romans predicting troubles dealt with them at once and even to avoid a war 
would not let them come to a head They knew that war cannot be avoided but can only be delayed to the 
advantage of others 
 

 

 

 
France however  did the opposite of those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of 
differing elements King Louis XII was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians who desired to 
obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention I will not blame the course taken by the king 
because wishing to get established in Italy and having no friends there  seeing rather that every door 
was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles  he was forced to accept those friendships which he 
could get He would have succeeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some 
mistakes The king however having acquired Lombardy got back at once the authority which the 
previous kingCharles had lost Genoa yielded the Florentines became his friends Many other powerful 
people and groups made advances to him to become his friend Only then the Venetians realized the 
foolishness of the course taken by them In order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy they had 
made the king master of twothirds of Italy 
 
With little difficulty the king could have maintained his position in Italy if he had observed the rules laid 
down above and kept all his friends secure and protected For although they were numerous they were 
both weak and frightened Some were afraid of the Church some of the Venetians Thus they would 
always have been forced to stand with him and because of this he could easily have made himself secure 
against those who remained powerful But he was no sooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting 
Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening 
himself losing friends and those who had rushed to be his friend He increased the strength of the Church 
by adding a lot of earthly power to the spiritual thus giving it greater authority Having committed this 
prime error Louis was forced to follow it up so much so that to put an end to the ambition of Pope 
Alexander and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany he was himself forced to come into Italy 
 
And as if it were not enough to have given power to the Church and to have lost his friends he wishing 
to have the kingdom of Naples divided it with the King of Spain and where he was the prime ruler in 
Italy he takes an associate with the result that the ambitious of that country and the discontents of his own 
had somewhere to shelter Whereas he could have left in the kingdom his own appointment as king he 
drove him out to put one there who was able to drive him Louis out in turn 
 
The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common and men always do so when they can For this 
they should be praised not blamed But when they cannot do so yet wish to do so by any means then 
there is foolishness and error Therefore if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces she 
ought to have done so If she could not then she ought not to have divided it The division of the state 
which she made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she gained a 
presence in Italy This other division deserved blame because it did not have the excuse of that necessity 
 
Louis made these five errors He destroyed the minor powers He increased the strength of one of the 
greater powers in Italy  the church He brought in a foreign power He did not settle in the country He 
did not create settlements If he had lived these errors were not enough to injure him However he made 
a sixth error by taking the Venetians states away from them He ought never to have consented to their 
ruin for they being powerful would always have kept others from invading Lombardy 
 
Thus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the principles observed by those who have 
taken possession of countries and wished to retain them Nor is there anything unusual in this but much 
that is reasonable and quite natural As I have told others the French did not understand the principles of 
controlling a state otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness And in fact 
it has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France and her 
ruin may be attributed to them From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails that he who 

 

 

 
is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined This is because that success has been brought about 
either by cleverness or by force and both are distrusted by the person who has been raised to power 
 
CHAPTER  
 
WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER DID NOT REBEL AGAINST 
THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH 
 
Considering the difficulties which men have had holding on to a newly acquired state some might 
wonder how the countries conquered by Alexander the Great remained loyal to his successors Alexander 
became the master of Asia in a few years and died before completing the task It thus might appear 
reasonable that the whole empire would have rebelled Nevertheless his successors maintained 
themselves and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose among themselves from their own 
ambitions 
 
These are the reasons why they survived The principalities of which one has record are found to be 
governed in two different ways either  by a prince with a body of servants who assist him to govern 
the kingdom as ministers by his favour and permission or  by a prince and barons who hold that rank 
by inheritance and not by appointment by the prince Such barons have states and their own subjects who 
recognize them as lords and have a natural loyalty to them Those states that are governed by a prince and 
his servants respect their prince more because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as 
having greater power than him If they show respect to another they do it as to a minister and official to 
whom they do not bear any particular loyalty 
 
The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France The entire 
country of the Turk is governed by one lord the others are his servants He divides his kingdom into 
regions and sends different administrators there He shifts and changes them as he chooses But the King 
of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords acknowledged by their own subjects and 
loved by them They have their own rights and the king cannot take these away except with some risk of 
rebellion Therefore there would be great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk but once it is 
conquered great ease in holding it The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are 
that the invader cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom Nor can he hope to be assisted in his 
designs by the rebellion of those whom the prince has around him This arises from the reasons given 
above His ministers being all slaves and servants cannot be easily bribed and one can expect little 
advantage from them when they have been bribed as they cannot carry the people with them Hence he 
who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united and he will have to rely more on his 
own strength than on the rebellion of others But once the Turk has been conquered in the field in such a 
way that he cannot replace his armies there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince Once they are 
killed there remains no one to fear The others have no credit with the people and as the conqueror did 
not rely on them before his victory so he ought not to fear them after it 
The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France One can easily enter there by gaining the 
cooperation of some baron of the kingdom for one always finds dissatisfied barons who desire a change 
Such men for the reasons given can open the way into the state and make the victory easy But if you 
wish to hold the kingdom afterwards you meet with infinite difficulties both from those who have 
assisted you and from those you have crushed Nor is it enough for you to have destroyed the family of 
the prince because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you 
Because you are unable either to satisfy or destroy them that state is lost whenever time brings the 
opportunity 

 

 

 
 
Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of Darius you will find it similar to the 
kingdom of the Turk Therefore it was only necessary for Alexander first to conquer him in battle and 
then to take the country from him After the victory Darius being killed the state remained secure to 
Alexander for the above reasons And if his successors had been united they would have enjoyed it 
securely and at their ease for there were no rebellions raised in the kingdom except those they caused 
themselves 
 
But it is impossible to easily hold states constituted like that of France Hence there were frequent 
rebellions against the Romans in Spain France and Greece because of the many principalities there were 
in these states As long as the memory of them lasted the Romans always held an insecure possession 
However with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed away and the 
Romans then became secure possessors And later when the states fought amongst themselves each one 
was able to attach to himself his own parts of the country according to the authority he had assumed 
there The family of the former lord had been destroyed and so none other than the Romans were 
acknowledged 
 
When these things are remembered no one will wonder at the ease with which Alexander held the Empire 
of Asia And none will wonder at the difficulties which others have had to keep an acquisition such as 
Pyrrhus and many more This is not caused by the ability of the conqueror but by the lack of uniformity 
in the subject state 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER 
THEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE JOINED TO ANOTHER PRINCIPALITY 
 
Whenever those states which have been acquired have been accustomed to live under their own laws and 
in freedom there are three courses for those who wish to hold them The first is to ruin them the next is 
to reside there in person the third is to permit them to live under their own laws drawing a regular 
payment from the state and establishing within it a governing group which will keep it friendly to you 
Because such a government being created by the prince knows that it cannot stand without his friendship 
and interest it tries hard to support him Therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will 
hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way 
 
There are for example the Spartans and the Romans The Spartans held Athens and Thebes establishing 
there a governing group nevertheless they lost them The Romans in order to hold Capua Carthage and 
Numantia largely destroyed them and did not lose them They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held 
it making it free and permitting its laws and did not succeed So to hold it they were forced to destroy 
many cities in the country There was in fact no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them 
And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it may expect to be 
destroyed by it because it always has liberty and its ancient rights as a way of uniting a rebellion Neither 
time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget these Whatever you may do to protect against rebellion the 
people never forget freedom or their old rights unless they are scattered 
 
But when cities or countries are accustomed to living under a prince and that princes family is destroyed 
they being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince cannot 

 

 

 
agree in making one from amongst themselves and they do not know how to govern themselves For this 
reason they are very slow to rebel A new prince can become accepted as their leader and secure them 
much more easily But in republics there is more energy greater hatred and more desire for revenge 
which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest So the safest way is to 
destroy them or to reside there 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONES OWN ARMS AND 
ABILITY 
 
Let no one be surprised if in speaking of entirely new principalities as I shall do I always refer to the 
highest examples both of prince and of state This is because men walking almost always in paths beaten 
by others and imitating their deeds are still unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain the 
power of those they imitate A wise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men and to 
imitate those who have been the best so that if his ability does not equal theirs at least it will have some 
traces of it He should act like those who are skilled at shooting with a bow and arrow who designing to 
hit the mark which yet appears too far distant and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow 
attains take aim much higher than the mark This is not done in order to reach a great height but to be 
able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach 
 
In entirely new principalities where there is a new prince more or less difficulty is found in keeping them 
depending on whether there is more or less ability in him who has acquired the state Now because 
becoming a prince from a private station requires either ability or good luck it is clear that one or other of 
these things will reduce many difficulties to some degree Nevertheless he who has relied least on good 
luck will be more strongly established Further it facilitates matters when the prince having no other 
state is forced to reside there in person 
 
But to come to those who by their own ability and not through fortune have risen to be princes I say that 
Moses Cyrus Romulus Theseus and such like are the most excellent examples And although one may 
not discuss Moses he having been a mere instrument of the will of God yet he ought to be admired if 
only for that favour which made him worthy to speak with God But in considering Cyrus and others who 
have acquired or founded kingdoms all will be found to be admirable and if their particular deeds and 
conduct are considered they will not be found to be less than those of Moses even though he had so great 
a guide And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed anything to fortune 
beyond opportunity which brought them the material to change into the form which seemed best to them 
Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been wasted and without those powers the 
opportunity would have come in vain 
 
It was necessary therefore to Moses that he should find the people of Israel in Egypt held as slaves by 
the Egyptians in order that they should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of slavery It 
was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba and that he should be abandoned at his birth in 
order that he should become King of Rome and founder of that country It was necessary that Cyrus 
should find the Persians unhappy with the government of the Medes and the Medes soft and weak 
through their long peace Theseus could not have shown his ability if he had not found the Athenians 
scattered These opportunities therefore made those men fortunate and their great ability enabled them 
to recognize the opportunity whereby their country was made strong and famous 

 

 

 
 
Those who by brave deeds become princes like these men acquire principality with difficulty but they 
keep it with ease The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and methods 
which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security And it ought to be 
remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more dangerous to conduct or more 
uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things This because the 
innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and not very active 
defenders in those who may do well under the new This coolness arises partly from fear of those against 
it who have the laws on their side and partly from the doubts of men who do not readily believe in new 
things until they have had a long experience of them Thus it happens that whenever those who are 
against it have the opportunity to attack they do it with great energy while the others defend without 
commitment in such a way that the prince is threatened along with them 
 
It is necessary therefore if we desire to discuss this matter thoroughly to inquire whether these 
innovators can rely on themselves or have to depend on others That is to say whether to achieve their 
goals do they have to use prayers or can they use force In the first instance they always succeed badly 
and never achieve anything but when they can rely on themselves and use force then they are rarely at 
risk Hence all armed religious leaders have conquered and the unarmed ones have been destroyed 
Besides the reasons mentioned the nature of the people is variable and while it is easy to persuade them 
it is difficult to fix them in that persuasion Thus it is necessary to take such measures that when they no 
longer believe it may be possible to make them believe by force 
 
If Moses Cyrus Theseus and Romulus had been unarmed they could not have enforced their 
constitutions for long  as happened in our time to Fra Girolamo Savonarola He was ruined with his new 
order of things immediately the people no longer believed in him and he had no means of keeping the 
loyalty of those who believed or of making the unbelievers believe Therefore armed religious leaders 
have great difficulties in achieving their goals for all their dangers are in the achievement Yet with 
ability they will overcome them But when these dangers are overcome and those who envied their 
success are destroyed they will begin to be respected and they will continue afterwards to be powerful 
secure respected and happy 
 
To these great examples I wish to add a lesser one but it is still like the others and is a good example It is 
Hiero the SyracusanThis man rose from nothing to be prince of Syracuse Nor did he either owe 
anything to fortune but opportunity The Syracusans who were under threat chose him for their captain 
Afterwards he was rewarded by being made their prince He was of so great ability even as a private 
citizen that one who writes of him says he needed only a kingdom to be king This man got rid of the old 
army organized the new gave up old agreements made new ones and as he had his own soldiers and 
supporters on such foundations he was able to build anything Thus while he had had much trouble in 
acquiring he had but little in keeping 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF 
OTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE 
 
Those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising 
but have much trouble in staying at the top They do not have any difficulties on the way up because they 

 

 

 
fly but they have many when they reach the top Such are those to whom some state is given either for 
money or by the favour of him who gives it This happened to many in Greece in the cities of Ionia and 
of the Hellespont where princes were made by Darius in order that they might hold the cities both for his 
security and his glory Similar to those were those leaders who by bribery of the soldiers from being 
citizens came to empire Such stand simply upon the favour and the fortune of him who has given them 
the position  two most inconstant and unstable things Neither have they the knowledge required for the 
position because unless they are men of great worth and ability it is not reasonable to expect that they 
should know how to command having always lived in a private condition In addition they cannot hold 
their position because they do not have forces which they can keep friendly and faithful 
 
States that rise unexpectedly then like all other things in nature which are born and grow rapidly cannot 
establish their foundations in such a way that the first storm will not destroy them unless as is said those 
who unexpectedly become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have to be prepared at 
once to hold that which fortune has thrown to them Thus those foundations which others have laid 
before they became princes they must lay afterwards 
 
Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or fortune I wish to describe two 
examples within our own times These are Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia Francesco by proper 
means and with great ability from being a private person rose to be Duke of Milan and that which he had 
acquired with a thousand anxieties he kept with little trouble On the other hand Cesare Borgia acquired 
his state while his father Pope Alexander the Sixth was in power On his fathers decline he lost it 
notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise and able 
man to firmly fix his roots in the states which the arms and fortunes of others had given to him 
 
He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards but they 
will be laid with trouble to the designer and danger to the building If therefore we look at all the steps 
taken by Cesare it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his future power It is well worth looking 
at them because I do not know what better advice to give a new prince than the example of his actions If 
his planning failed that was not his fault but simply extraordinary bad luck 
 
Pope Alexander the Sixth in wishing to promote Cesare his son had many immediate and prospective 
difficulties Firstly it seemed that the only available state would be one belonging to the Church If he 
was willing to use a Church state he knew that the Duke of Milan and the Venetians would not consent 
Besides this he saw the armies of Italy that might have assisted him were in the control of people who 
did not want to see the Church made more powerful by this move It was necessary therefore to upset 
this state of affairs and create disorder among the powers so as to make himself more securely master of 
part of their states This was easy for him to do because he found the Venetians motivated by other 
reasons inclined to bring back the French into Italy He decided not to oppose this but to assist it by 
helping King Louis officially end his former marriage Therefore the King of France came into Italy with 
the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Pope Alexander He was no sooner in Milan than the 
Pope had soldiers from him for the attempt on the Romagna which yielded to him simply from fear of the 
king Cesare therefore having acquired the Romagna and beaten the Colonnesi while wishing to hold 
that and to advance further was hindered by two things Firstly his forces did not appear loyal to him 
Secondly there was general good feeling towards France That is to say he feared that the forces of the 
Orsini which he was using would not be loyal to him They might not only hinder him from winning 
more but might themselves seize what he had won and the King of France might also do the same He 
had a warning of the Orsini when after taking Faenza and attacking Bologna he saw them go very 
unwillingly to that attack He learned the mind of the king when he himself after taking the Dukedom of 

 

 

 
Urbino attacked Tuscany and the king made him stop that undertaking Hence Cesare decided not to 
depend upon the arms and the luck of others any more 
 
Firstly he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome by winning over all their followers who 
were gentlemen and making them his gentlemen giving them good pay and honouring them with official 
positions and power suited to their rank so that in a few months all loyalty to the parties was destroyed 
and directed entirely to Cesare After this he waited for an opportunity to crush the Orsini having 
scattered the Colonnessi supporters This opportunity soon came to him and he used it well The Orsini 
perceiving eventually that the promotion of Cesare and the Church was ruin to them called a meeting of 
the Magione in Perugia From this came the rebellion at Urbino and the rebellions in the Romagna with 
endless dangers to Cesare However he overcame these with the help of the French Having restored his 
authority he decided not to leave it at risk by relying either on the French or other outside forces He thus 
decided to act more cleverly and to hide his intentions well By the mediation of Signor Pagolo  whom 
Cesare secured with all kinds of attention giving him money clothes and horses  the Orsini became 
more sympathetic so that their simple trust brought them into his power Having got rid of the leaders 
and turned their supporters into his friends and having all the Romagna and the Dukedom of Urbino 
Cesare had laid sufficiently good foundations for his power Moreover the people were now beginning to 
appreciate their improved living conditions so they were happy to support him 
 
There is another important point to note When Cesare occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule 
of weak masters who robbed their subjects rather than ruled them and gave them more cause for 
rebellion than for union So the country was full of robbery quarrels and every kind of violence So 
wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority he considered it necessary to give it a good 
governor Thus he promoted Ramiro dOrco an efficient and cruel man to whom he gave the fullest 
power This man in a short time restored peace and unity with great success Afterwards Cesare 
considered that it was not a good idea to confer such excessive authority for he had no doubt that he 
would become disliked So he set up a court of judgment in the country under an excellent president in 
which all cities had their advocates He knew that the past severity had caused some hatred against him 
So to clear himself in the minds of the people and make them entirely loyal to him he desired to show 
that if any cruelty had been practised it had not originated from him but came from the personal cruelty 
of the governor Under this pretence Cesare took Ramiro and one morning had him killed and left in the 
square at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side This terrible sight caused the people to be 
at the same time satisfied and worried 
 
But let us return to where we started Cesare now found himself sufficiently powerful and partly secured 
from immediate dangers by having armed himself in his own way and having largely crushed those 
forces around him that could injure him If he wished to proceed with his conquest he next had to 
consider France He knew that the king who was now aware of his own misjudgements with Cesare 
would not support him So from this time Cesare began to seek new friends and to delay helping France 
with the campaign which she was making towards the kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were 
attacking Gaeta It was his intention to secure himself against them and he would have quickly succeeded 
if his father Pope Alexander had lived 
 
Such was his line of action as to present affairs But as to the future he had to fear in the first place that a 
new Pope might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which his father Pope 
Alexander had given him So Cesare decided to act in four ways Firstly by killing the families of those 
lords whom he had defeated so that the new Pope could not use them as an excuse to attack him 
Secondly by winning the loyalty of all the gentlemen of Rome so that they would not support the Pope 

 

 

 
Thirdly by gaining the support of the college of cardinals Fourthly by acquiring so much power before 
Pope Alexander died that he could by his own means resist the first shock He had completed three of 
these four things at the death of Alexander He had killed as many of the defeated lords as he could lay 
hands on and few had escaped He had won over the Roman gentlemen and he controlled the largest 
group in the college of cardinals And as to any fresh acquisition he intended to become master of 
Tuscany for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino and Pisa was under his protection As he no 
longer had to worry about France for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the 
Spaniards and in this way both were forced to seek his support he wanted to take Pisa After this Lucca 
and Siena would yield at once partly through hatred and partly through fear of the Florentines The 
Florentines would have had no remedy if he had continued to succeed as he was succeeding the year that 
his father Pope Alexander died because he would already have already acquired so much power and 
reputation that he would have stood by himself and would no longer have depended on the luck and the 
forces of others but solely on his own power and ability 
 
But Pope Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword He left Cesare with the state of 
Romagna alone well secured with the rest in the air between two very powerful enemy armies and in 
very ill health Yet there was in Cesare such boldness and ability and he knew so well how men are to be 
won or lost and so firm were the foundations which in so short a time he had laid that if he had not had 
those armies on his back or if he had been in good health he would have overcome all difficulties And it 
is obvious that his foundations were good because the Romagna waited for him for more than a month 
In Rome although barely half alive he remained secure and while the Baglioni the Vitelli and the 
Orsini might come to Rome they could not carry out anything against him If he could not choose the 
Pope he wanted at least the one whom he did not want would not have been elected But if he had been in 
good health at the death of Alexander everything would have been different for him On the day that 
Alexanders successor Pope Julius the Second was elected he told me that he had thought of everything 
that might occur at the death of his father and had provided a remedy for all of it except that he had 
never anticipated that when that death did happen he himself would be on the point of dying 
 
When all the actions of Cesare are considered I cannot criticise him but rather it appears as I have said 
that I ought to hold him up as a model for all those who by the fortune or the power of others are placed 
in power Cesare having a noble spirit and farreaching aims could not have regulated his conduct 
otherwise Only the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness spoiled his plans Therefore 
anyone who considers it necessary to secure himself in his new principality to win friends to overcome 
either by force or deception to make himself loved and feared by the people to be followed and respected 
by the soldiers to destroy those who have power or reason to hurt him to change the old order of things 
for new to be severe and still loved generous and liberal to destroy a disloyal army and to create a new 
one to maintain friendship with kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with eagerness 
and offend with caution cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this man 
 
He can only be criticised for the election of Pope Julius the Second in whom he made a bad choice 
because as is said not being able to elect the Pope of his own choice he could have hindered any other 
from being elected Pope He ought never to have consented to the election of any cardinal whom he had 
injured or who had cause to fear him if they became the Pope Men injure others either from fear or from 
hatred Cesare had injured several cardinals The rest of them in becoming Pope would have feared him 
Cesare ought to have created a Spaniard Pope and failing that he ought to have consented to a Pope who 
had depended on him and had a good relationship with him He who believes that new benefits will cause 
great persons to forget old injuries is deceived Therefore Cesare was wrong in his choice and it was the 
cause of his ultimate ruin 

 

 

 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS 
 
A prince can also rise from a private situation in two other ways neither of which can be entirely 
attributed to fortune or genius These methods are when by some wicked actions one gains the 
principality or when by the favour of his fellow citizens a private person becomes the prince of his 
country The first method wickedness will be illustrated by two examples  one ancient the other 
modern  and without going further into the subject I consider these two examples will be enough for 
those who may have to follow them 
 
Agathocles the Sicilian became King of Syracuse not only from being an ordinary citizen but also from 
a low and humble position This man the son of a pot maker through all the changes in his fortunes 
always led a wicked life Nevertheless he accompanied his wickedness with so much ability of mind and 
body that having devoted himself to the military profession he rose through its ranks to become leader of 
the army in Syracuse Once he was established in that position he resolved to make himself prince and to 
seize by violence that which had already been willingly given to him He came to an understanding for 
this purpose with Amilcar the Carthaginian who with his army was fighting in Sicily One morning he 
assembled the people and the senate of Syracuse as if he had to discuss with them things relating to the 
Republic At a given signal the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people He then seized 
and held the princedom of that city without any civil rebellion And although he was twice defeated by 
the Carthaginians and ultimately besieged he was not only able to defend his city but leaving part of his 
men for its defence with the others he attacked the Carthaginians in Africa In a short time the 
Carthaginians were forced to stop their siege on Syracuse The Carthaginians reduced to extreme 
necessity were forced to make peace with Agathocles and leaving Sicily to him had to be content with 
the possession of Africa 
 
Anyone who considers the actions and the genius of this man will see nothing or little which can be 
attributed to fortune He attained success as is shown above not by the favour of any one but step by 
step in the military profession This advancement was gained with a thousand troubles and dangers and 
was afterwards boldly held by him in spite of many dangers Yet it cannot be called ability to kill fellow 
citizens to deceive friends to be without faith without mercy without religion such methods may gain 
empire but not glory Still if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and removing himself from 
dangers is considered together with his greatness of mind in overcoming hardships it seems that he 
should be admired as much as the most notable captain Nevertheless his terrible cruelty and infinite 
wickedness do not permit him to be ranked among the most excellent men What he achieved however 
cannot be attributed to fortune 
 
In our times during the rule of Alexander the Sixth Oliverotto da Fermo his parents having died many 
years before was brought up by his uncle Giovanni Fogliani In the early days of his youth he was sent to 
fight under Pagolo Vitelli so that being trained under his discipline he might attain some high position 
in the military profession After Pagolo died he fought under his brother Vitellozzo and in a very short 
time being clever and capable he became the leading man in his profession But he did not like serving 
under others So he resolved with the aid of some citizens of Fermo to whom the slavery of their 
country was more important than its liberty and with the help of the Vitelleschi to seize Fermo So he 
wrote to his uncle Giovanni Fogliani that having been away from home for many years he wished to 

 

 

 
visit him and his city He also wanted to look at what his parents had left him He said that although he 
had not laboured to acquire anything except honour he wanted the citizens of Fermo to see he had not 
spent his time in vain Thus he would be accompanied by one hundred of his soldiers his friends and 
servants He begged Giovanni to arrange for him to be received honourably by the Fermians in 
recognition of not only his own achievements but also those of Giovanni himself who had brought him 
up 
 
Giovanni therefore did his best for his nephew Oliverotto was honourably received by the Fermians 
and he stayed in his uncles own house After several days and having arranged what was necessary for 
his wicked designs Oliverotto gave a formal dinner to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the leaders 
of Fermo When the food and all the other usual entertainment were finished Oliverotto began to speak of 
serious matters speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare Giovanni and others 
replied to this speech but Oliverotto rose at once saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a 
more private place He went into another room and Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after 
him No sooner were they seated than soldiers came out from secret places and killed Giovanni and the 
rest After these murders Oliverotto rode up and down the town on horseback and besieged the governing 
council The people were afraid and were forced to obey him and to form a government with Oliverotto 
as the prince He killed all those who were able to injure him and strengthened himself with new civil 
and military laws in such a way that in the year during which he held the principality not only was he 
secure in the city of Fermo but he had become more powerful than all his neighbours His destruction 
would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be tricked by Cesare 
Borgia One year after he had committed the murder of his uncle he was killed 
 
Some may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles and his like after infinite wickedness and 
cruelties should live securely for so long in his country be able to defend himself from external enemies 
and never have to deal with rebellion by his own citizens Many others by means of cruelty have never 
been able even in peaceful times to hold the state still less in the doubtful times of war I believe that this 
follows from severe measures being badly or properly used They are properly used if it is possible to say 
that evil is proper if they are applied at one blow are necessary to ones security and are not persisted in 
afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects The severe measures are badly 
employed if although they are few in the commencement multiply with time rather than decrease Those 
who practise the first system are able by the aid of God or man in some degree to later soften their rule 
as Agathocles did It is impossible for those who continue to be cruel to maintain their control 
 
Hence in seizing a state the attacker ought to examine closely all those injuries which are necessary and 
to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to repeat them daily Thus by not continually upsetting the 
people he will be able to make them feel more secure and win them over by benefits He who does 
otherwise either from reluctance or evil advice is always forced to keep the knife in his hand He cannot 
rely on his subjects and they cannot attach themselves to him because of the continued and repeated 
wrongs Injuries ought to be done all at one time so that being tasted less they offend less Benefits 
ought to be given little by little so that their flavour may last longer 
 
Above all things a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected 
circumstances whether of good or evil shall make him change If the necessity for this comes in troubled 
times you are too late for severe measures Mild ones will not help you because they will be considered 
as forced from you and no one will feel grateful to you for them 
 
 

 

 

 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPALITY 
 
But coming to the other point  where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country not by 
wickedness or violence but by the favour of his fellow citizens  this may be called a constitutional 
principality Genius or fortune are not needed to attain to it but rather a fortunate cleverness Such a 
principality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the favour of the nobles because in all 
cities these two distinct parties are found The people do not wish to be ruled or oppressed by the nobles 
and the nobles wish to rule and oppress the people From these two opposite desires there are three 
possible results a principality self government or disorder 
 
A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles depending on who has the opportunity The 
nobles seeing they cannot overcome the people begin to push one of their own people forward and they 
make him a prince so that under his shadow they can achieve their ambitions The people finding they 
cannot resist the nobles also cry up the reputation of one of themselves and make him a prince so as to 
be defended by his authority He who obtains the principality by the assistance of the nobles maintains 
himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people This is because the former 
finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals Because of this he can neither 
rule nor manage them to his liking But he who gains the principality by popular favour finds himself 
alone and has none around him or few who are not prepared to obey him 
 
Besides this one cannot by fair dealing and without injury to others satisfy the nobles but you can 
satisfy the people for their goals are more proper than those of the nobles The nobles wish to oppress 
while the people only desire not to be oppressed A prince can never secure himself against a hostile 
people because they are too many On the other hand he can secure himself from the nobles as they are 
few in number The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them 
However from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment but also that they will rise against 
him for they being in these affairs more farseeing and clever always come forward in time to save 
themselves and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to win Furthermore the prince must 
always live with the same people but he can do well without the same nobles He can make and unmake 
them daily and give or take away their authority whenever it pleases him 
 
Therefore to make this point clearer I say that the nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways that 
is to say they either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune or they do 
not Those who so bind themselves and are not greedy ought to be respected and loved Those who do 
not bind themselves may be dealt with in two ways They may fail to do this through cowardice and a 
natural lack of courage In this case you ought to make use of them especially those who give good 
advice Thus while in good times you honour them in difficult times you do not have to fear them But 
when for their own ambitious ends they avoid binding themselves it is a sign that they are giving more 
thought to themselves than to you A prince ought to guard himself against such people and ought to fear 
them as if they were open enemies because in difficult times they always help to ruin him 
 
Therefore one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly He 
can easily do this because they only ask not to be oppressed by him But one who without the support of 
the people becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles ought above everything to seek to win the 
people over to himself He may easily do this if he takes them under his protection Because men when 
they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil are bound more closely to their protector 

 

 

 
Thus the people quickly become more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality 
through their support The prince can win their support in many ways but as these vary according to the 
circumstances one cannot give fixed rules and so I omit them But I repeat it is necessary for a prince to 
have the people friendly otherwise he has no security in difficult times 
 
Nabis prince of the Spartans defended his country and his government against the attack of all Greece 
and of a victorious Roman army To overcome this danger it was only necessary for him to make himself 
secure against a few but this would not have been sufficient if the people had been hostile And do not let 
any one attack this statement with the old saying that He who builds on the people builds on the mud 
This saying is true when a private citizen makes a foundation there and foolishly persuades himself that 
the people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies But if the leader is a prince who has 
established himself as a person who can command and is a man of courage who does not fail in other 
qualifications and who by his resolution and energy keeps all the people encouraged  such a one will 
never find himself abandoned by the people and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well 
 
These principalities are open to danger when they are passing from the constitutional to the absolute order 
of government for such princes either rule personally or through councils In the latter case their 
government is weaker and more insecure because it rests entirely on the attitude of those citizens who are 
placed on the council and who especially in troubled times can destroy the government with great ease 
either by trickery or open rebellion The prince does not have the chance in a rebellion to exercise 
absolute authority because the citizens and subjects accustomed to receiving orders from the council are 
not willing to obey him when there is an unstable situation Moreover there will always be in doubtful 
times a scarcity of men whom he can trust Such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet 
times when citizens have need of the state because then everyone agrees with him They all promise to 
support him and when death is far distant they all wish to die for him But in troubled times when the 
state has need of its citizens then he finds only a few Moreover this experiment of moving from a 
constitutional to an absolute government is dangerous because it can only be tried once Therefore a wise 
prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in all kinds of circumstances have need of 
the state and of him and then he will always find them faithful 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE 
MEASURED 
 
It is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities that is whether 
a prince has such power that in case of need he can support himself with his own resources or whether 
he always has need of the assistance of others To be more specific I consider those who are able to 
support themselves by their own resources as those who can either by having plenty of men or money 
raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them I consider those always to 
have need of others as those who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field but are forced to 
defend themselves by sheltering behind walls The first case has been discussed but we will speak of it 
again should it come up In the second case one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to 
provision and strengthen their towns and not on any account try to defend the country And whoever 
protects his town well and has managed the other concerns of his subjects in the way stated above will 
never be attacked without great caution Men are not eager for actions where the difficulties can be clearly 
seen and it will be seen to not be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well protected and who is 

 

 

 
not hated by his people 
 
The cities of Germany are absolutely free they own little of the country around them and they yield 
obedience to the king when it suits them They do not fear this or any power they may have near them 
because they are protected in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by direct attack would 
be drawn out and difficult They have proper ditches and walls they have sufficient large guns and they 
always keep enough supplies in public store houses for one years eating drinking and fighting And 
beyond this to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state they always have the means of giving 
work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city and through the pursuit 
of which the people are supported They also value military exercises and moreover have many laws to 
support these exercises 
 
Therefore a prince who has a strong city and who has not made himself hated will not be attacked If 
any one does attack he will only be driven off in defeat Because the affairs of this world are so 
changeable it is almost impossible to keep an army for a whole year in the field without being interfered 
with And whoever should reply If the people have property outside the city and see it burnt they will 
not remain patient and the long attack and selfinterest will make them forget their prince To this I 
answer that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one time 
hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long and at another time encouraging fear of the cruelty 
of the enemy At the same time he should deal appropriately with those subjects who seem to him to 
speak out too much 
 
Furthermore the enemy would naturally immediately on their arrival burn and ruin the country at the time 
when the spirits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence Therefore so much the less should 
the prince hesitate because after a time when spirits have cooled the damage is already done and there 
is no longer any remedy Thus the people are at that time much more ready to unite with their prince 
because he appears to owe them a favour now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions 
ruined in his defence This is because it is in the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as 
much as by those they receive Therefore if everything is well considered it will not be difficult for a 
wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens strong and loyal from first to last when he continues to 
support and defend them 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING CHURCH PRINCIPALITIES 
 
It only remains now to speak of church principalities All of the difficulties with them occur prior to 
getting possession because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune and they can be held 
without either for they are sustained by the ancient laws of religion These laws are so powerful and of 
such character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live These 
princes alone have states and do not defend them They have subjects and do not rule them The states 
although unguarded are not taken from them The subjects although not ruled do not care and they have 
neither the desire nor the ability to rebel So only such principalities are secure and happy But being 
supported by powers to which the human mind cannot reach I shall speak no more of them because 
being created and maintained by God it would be the act of a proud and foolish man to discuss them 
 
Nevertheless if any one should ask of me how it happens that the Church has attained such greatness in 

 

 

 
earthly power seeing that up to the time of Alexander Italian leaders have not placed much value on the 
Churchs earthly power  yet now a king of France trembles before it and it has been able to drive him 
from Italy and to ruin the Venetians  although this may be very obvious it seems worthwhile to 
describe it again 
 
Before Charles King of France came into Italy this country was under the control of the Pope the 
Venetians the King of Naples the Duke of Milan and the Florentines These leaders had two principal 
anxieties the first that no foreign army should enter Italy and the second that none of themselves should 
seize others lands Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians To 
restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary as it was for the defence of Ferrara To 
keep down the Pope they made use of the barons of Rome They consisted of two groups the Orsini and 
Colonnesi who always had a reason for disorder and standing with weapons in their hands under the 
eyes of the Pope kept the Pope weak and powerless And although there might sometimes be a 
courageous Pope yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these problems In addition the short 
life of a Pope is also a cause of weakness because in the ten years which is the average life of a Pope he 
can with difficulty reduce the power of only one of the groups And if for example the Colonnesi were 
almost destroyed another group would arise hostile to the Orsini who would support the Colonnesi but 
they would not have time to ruin the Orsini This was the reason why the earthly powers of the Church 
were not highly regarded in Italy 
 
This however was not so in the time of Pope Alexander the Sixth Of all the Popes that have ever been he 
showed how a Pope with both money and military power was able to succeed With the help of his son 
Cesare Borgia and by reason of the entry of the French into Italy he brought about all those things which 
I have discussed above in the actions of Cesare And although his intention was not to benefit the Church 
nevertheless what Pope Alexander did contributed to the greatness of the Church which after his death 
and the ruin of Cesare gained the benefit of all his labours 
Pope Julius came soon after Pope Alexander and found the Church strong possessing all the Romagna 
the barons of Rome made powerless and through the efforts of Alexander the Colonessi and Orsini 
groups weakened He also found the way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been 
practised before Alexanders time Such things Julius not only followed but improved upon He also 
intended to gain Bologna to ruin the Venetians and to drive the French out of Italy He achieved all of 
these goals and even more to his credit  he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private 
individual He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi groups within the bounds in which he found them 
Although some among them wanted to make trouble nevertheless he held two things firm  first the 
greatness of the Church with which he frightened them and the other not allowing them to have their 
own cardinals who could cause disorder among them Whenever these groups have their own cardinals 
they do not remain quiet for long Cardinals encourage the groups like the Orsini in Rome and the barons 
are forced to support them Thus from the ambitions of cardinals arise disorders and rebellion among the 
barons For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo was most powerful and it is to be hoped that if others 
made the Church great in arms he will make it still greater and more respected by his goodness and 
infinite other virtues 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERS THERE ARE AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES 
 
I have described the characteristics of the various principalities that I proposed to discuss and I have 

 

 

 
considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad I have also shown the methods by which 
many have sought to acquire principalities and to hold them It now remains for me to discuss generally 
the means of attack and defence which go with each of them 
 
We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his foundations well laid otherwise it 
follows of necessity he will go to ruin The chief foundations of all states new as well as old or mixed 
are good laws and good arms As there cannot be good laws where the state is not well armed it follows 
that where they are well armed they have good laws I shall leave the laws out of the discussion and shall 
speak of the arms 
 
The arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own or they are mercenaries auxiliaries or 
mixed Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous If a prince holds his state based on these 
arms he will stand neither firm nor safe because they are ambitious not united without discipline 
unfaithful brave in front of friends and cowardly before enemies They have neither fear of God nor 
loyalty to men Destruction caused by them is put off only as long as the attack lasts In peace one is 
robbed by them and in war by the enemy The fact is they have no other attraction or reason for staying 
in battle than a small amount of pay which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you They are 
ready enough to be your soldiers while you do not make war but if war comes they disappear or run from 
the enemy I will have no trouble in proving this because the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else 
than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries Although they formerly made some display 
and appeared brave amongst themselves yet when the foreigners came they showed what they really 
were Thus it was that Charles King of France was allowed to seize Italy without a show of resistance 
Whoever told us that our weaknesses were the cause of it told the truth But they were not the weaknesses 
he imagined but those which I have described And as they were the weaknesses of princes it is the 
princes who have also suffered the result 
I wish to demonstrate further the danger of these soldiers The mercenary captains are either capable men 
or they are not If they are you cannot trust them because they always want to become more powerful 
either by oppressing you who are their master or others contrary to your intentions If the mercenary 
captain is not skilful you are ruined in the usual way 
 
If it is argued that any soldiers will act in the same way whether mercenary or not I reply that when arms 
must be used they are under the control of a prince or a republic The prince ought to go in person and 
perform the duty of a captain The republic has to send its citizens and when one is sent who does not 
turn out satisfactorily it ought to send him back When one is a worthy captain it ought to hold on to him 
by the laws so that he does not leave the command Experience has shown princes and republics single
handed make the greatest progress and mercenaries do nothing except damage It is more difficult for a 
republic armed with its own arms to be taken over by one of its citizens than it is to take over one armed 
with foreign arms Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free The Swiss are completely 
armed and quite free 
 
Of ancient mercenaries for example there are the Carthaginians who were oppressed by their mercenary 
soldiers after the first war with the Romans although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for 
captains After the death of Epaminondas Philip of Macedon was made captain of their soldiers by the 
Thebans and after victory he took away their liberty 
 
Duke Filippo being dead the Milanese hired Francesco Sforza to fight against the Venetians and he 
having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio joined with the Venetians to crush the Milanese his masters 
His father Sforza having been hired by Queen Johanna of Naples left her unprotected so that she was 

 

 

 
forced to throw herself into the arms of the King of Aragon in order to save her kingdom On the other 
hand the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended their possessions by using mercenaries and yet 
their captains did not make themselves princes but have defended them I consider however that the 
Florentines in this case have been lucky because of the able captains of whom they might have stood in 
fear some have not conquered some have been successfully opposed and others have turned their 
ambitions elsewhere One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto and since he did not conquer his 
loyalty cannot be proved However everyone will acknowledge that if he had conquered the Florentines 
would have been in his power Sforza always had the Bracceschi against him so they watched each other 
Francesco turned his ambition to Lombardy Braccio against the Church and the kingdom of Naples But 
let us come to that which happened a short while ago The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo 
Vitelli a very careful man who from a private position had risen to become very famous If this man had 
taken Pisa nobody can deny that it would have been proper for the Florentines to keep on good terms 
with him because if he became the soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting and if they 
stayed friendly with him they would have to obey him The Venetians if their achievements are 
considered will be seen to have acted safely and successfully as long as they sent their own men to war 
when with their own armed gentlemen and citizens they did very well This was before they turned to 
fighting on land but when they began to fight on land they gave up this virtue and followed the custom of 
Italy In the beginning of their expansion on land by not having much land to control and because of 
their great reputation they did not have much to fear from their captains But when they expanded they 
had a taste of this mistake of hiring mercenaries Having found him a very brave man they beat the Duke 
of Milan under his leadership and on the other hand knowing how unenthusiastic he was in the war 
they feared they would no longer conquer under him For this reason they were not willing nor were they 
able to let him go So in order not to lose what they had acquired again they were forced to murder him 
in order to secure themselves Afterwards they had Bartolomeo da Bergamo Roberto da San Severino 
the count of Pitigliano and the like for their captains under whom they had to fear loss and not gain This 
happened afterwards at Vaila where in one battle they lost that which in eight hundred years they had 
acquired with so much trouble From such mercenaries conquests come slowly are long delayed and are 
not very significant The losses however are sudden and very great 
 
Because with these examples I have reached Italy which has been ruled for many years by mercenaries I 
wish to discuss them in depth in order that having seen their rise and progress one may be better 
prepared to stand against them You must understand that the empire has recently been destroyed in Italy 
that the Pope has acquired more earthly power and that Italy has been divided up into more states The 
reasons are that many of the great cities took up arms against their nobles who formerly supported by the 
emperor were oppressing them The Church was supporting the rebellions so as to gain earthly authority 
In many others their citizens became princes Thus Italy fell partly into the hands of the Church and of 
the republics The Church consisted of priests and the republic consisted of citizens who were not 
soldiers so both commenced hiring foreigners as mercenaries 
 
The first who made mercenaries well known was Alberigo da Conio from the Romagna From the school 
of this man came among others Braccio and Sforza who in their time were the masters of Italy After 
these came all the other captains who till now have directed the military of Italy The outcome of all their 
bravery has been that Italy has been invaded by Charles robbed by Louis exploited by Ferdinand and 
insulted by the Swiss The principle that has guided the mercenaries has been first to lower the credit of 
foot soldiers so that they might increase their own status They did this because they did not have their 
own lands to give them income and so had to survive on their pay They were thus unable to support 
many soldiers Moreover having foot soldiers did not give them any authority so they were led to 
employ horse soldiers In this way with a moderate force they could maintain themselves with some 

 

 

 
status However this meant that in an army of twenty thousand soldiers there were not even two 
thousand foot soldiers Besides this they used every trick to reduce their own involvement and the danger 
to themselves and their soldiers These tricks included not killing in the battle but taking prisoners and 
liberating without getting money in return They did not attack towns at night nor did the soldiers in the 
towns attack camps at night They did not surround their own camps either with a wall or a ditch nor did 
they fight in the winter All these things were permitted by their military rules and were created by them 
to avoid as I have said both effort and danger Thus they have diminished Italys reputation and have 
brought it into slavery 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING AUXILIARIES MIXED ARMIES AND ONES OWN SOLDIERS 
 
Auxiliaries which are the other kind of most useless soldiers are employed when a prince calls in other 
forces to aid and defend him as was done by Pope Julius in most recent times Pope Julius having in the 
attack against Ferrara had poor results from his mercenaries turned to auxiliaries and bargained with 
Ferdinand King of Spain for his assistance with men and soldiers These soldiers may be useful and 
good in themselves but for the person who calls them in they are always disadvantageous because by 
losing a prince is thoroughly defeated and by winning a prince becomes under their control 
 
Although ancient histories may be full of examples I do not wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius 
the Second the danger of which cannot fail to be perceived Pope Julius wishing to get Ferrara threw 
himself entirely into the hands of foreigners But his good fortune brought about a third event so that he 
did not suffer the effects of his bad choice His auxiliaries were thoroughly defeated at Ravenna and the 
Swiss unexpectedly arrived and drove the conquerors away Thus he did not become the prisoner of his 
enemies they having been driven away nor of his auxiliaries he having conquered by other arms than 
theirs 
 
The Florentines being entirely without arms sent ten thousand Frenchmen to take Pisa whereby they ran 
into more danger than at any other time of their troubles 
 
The Emperor of Constantinople sent ten thousand Turks into Greece to oppose his neighbours When the 
war was finished the Turks were not willing to leave This was the beginning of the slavery of Greece to 
outsiders 
 
Therefore let him who has no desire to conquer make use of auxiliaries because they are much more 
dangerous than mercenaries With them the failure is ready made They are all united and all yield 
obedience to others But with mercenaries when they have conquered more time and better opportunities 
are needed to injure you They are not all of one community they are found and paid by you and a third 
party which you have made their head is not able all at once to assume enough authority to injure you In 
conclusion in mercenaries cowardice is the biggest danger in auxiliaries courage The wise prince 
therefore has always avoided these types of soldiers and used his own He has been willing to lose with 
his own soldiers rather than to conquer with others A real victory is not gained with the arms of others 
 
I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions Cesare entered the Romagna with auxiliaries 
taking there only French soldiers and with them he took Imola and Forli But afterwards such auxiliary 
forces not appearing to him to be reliable he turned to mercenaries seeing less danger in them So he 

 

 

 
hired the Orsini and Vitelli Soon after when he found them unreliable unfaithful and dangerous he 
destroyed them and used his own men The difference between one and the other of these forces can be 
easily seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of Cesare when he had the 
French when he had the Orsini and Vitelli and when he relied on his own soldiers on whose loyalty he 
could always count and found ever increasing He was rated much more highly when everyone saw that 
he was complete master of his own forces 
 
I was not intending to go beyond Italian examples and recent examples but I am unwilling to leave out 
Hiero the Syracusan who I have mentioned before This man as I have said who was made head of the 
army by the Syracusans soon found out that a mercenary army was of no use He realised that he could 
neither keep them nor let them go so he had them all cut to pieces and afterwards made war using his 
own forces and not foreigners 
 
I also wish to mention an instance from the Bible which is applicable to this subject David offered 
himself to Saul to fight Goliath To give him courage Saul armed him with some weapons which David 
rejected as soon as he had them on his back He said he could make no use of them and that he wished to 
meet the enemy with his own simple weapons In conclusion the arms of others either fall from your 
back or they weigh you down or bind you fast 
 
Charles the Seventh the father of King Louis the Eleventh having by good fortune and bravery liberated 
France from the English recognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own In his kingdom 
he established laws concerning soldiers Afterwards his son King Louis got rid of his own the foot 
soldiers and began to hire the Swiss This mistake followed by others is as is now seen a source of 
danger to that kingdom Having raised the reputation of the Swiss he has entirely diminished the value of 
his own army because he has none of his own foot soldiers at all and his other soldiers are led by the 
Swiss They are so accustomed to fighting beside the Swiss that it does not appear that they can now 
conquer without them Hence the French cannot stand against the Swiss and without the Swiss they do 
not come off well against others The armies of the French have thus become mixed partly mercenary 
and partly national These together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone but are 
much worse than ones own forces And this example proves it for the kingdom of France would be much 
stronger if the laws of Charles had been strengthened or maintained 
 
Most people on beginning a task which looks fine at first cannot see the poison that is hidden in it 
Therefore if a prince cannot recognize evils until they are upon him he is not truly wise and this insight 
is given to few If the fall of the Roman Empire is examined it will be found to have commenced with the 
hiring of the Goths From that time the strength of the Roman Empire began to decline and all that 
courage which had raised it passed away to others 
 
I conclude therefore that no principality is secure without having its own forces in fact it is entirely 
dependent on good fortune not having the courage which in bad times would defend it It has always 
been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as reputation or 
power not founded on its own strength Ones own forces are those which are composed either of subjects 
citizens or dependents  all others are mercenaries or auxiliaries The way to make ones own forces ready 
will be easily found if the rules I have suggested are carefully considered and if one will consider how 
Philip the father of Alexander the Great and many republics and princes have armed and organized 
themselves 
 
 

 

 

 
CHAPTER  
 
THAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR 
 
A prince ought to have no other aim or thought nor select anything else for his study than war and its 
rules and discipline This is the sole art that belongs to him who rules and it is of such force that it not 
only supports those who are born princes but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that 
rank It is often seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states 
and the first cause of losing it is to neglect this art What enables a prince to acquire a state is to be master 
of the art Francesco Sforza through studying war rose from being a private citizen to become Duke of 
Milan and his sons through avoiding the hardships and troubles of arms fell from being dukes to become 
private citizens For among other evils which being unarmed brings you it causes you to be despised 
This is one of those dangers which a prince ought to guard against There is a big difference between 
being armed and being unarmed and it is not reasonable that an armed person should willingly obey an 
unarmed person An unarmed man will not be secure among armed servants because by being unarmed 
he will be suspicious of them and they will despise him So it is not possible for them to work well 
together Therefore a prince who does not understand the art of war over and above the other 
disadvantages already mentioned cannot be respected by his soldiers nor can he rely on them He ought 
never therefore to have this subject of war out of his thoughts and in peace he should devote himself 
more to its exercise than in times of war He can do this in two ways by action and by study 
As regards action he ought above all things to keep his men well trained and organized and to carry out 
extended exercises in the field by which he accustoms his body to hardships and learns something of the 
nature of the land He gets to find out how the mountains rise how the valleys open out how the plains 
lie and to understand the nature of rivers and wet areas and to do all this with careful planning and 
analysis This knowledge is useful in two ways Firstly he learns to know his country and is better able 
to undertake its defence Afterwards by means of the knowledge and observation of that land he can 
easily understand any other which it may be necessary for him to study because the hills valleys and 
plains and rivers that are for instance in Tuscany have a certain similarity to those of other countries 
So with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others The 
prince that lacks this skill lacks the essentials which it is desirable that a military leader should possess It 
teaches him to surprise his enemy to select places to camp to lead armies to organise the soldiers in a 
battle and to besiege towns in the best way 
 
Philopoemen prince of the Achaeans among other praises which writers have heaped on him is 
especially praised because in times of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war When 
he was in the country with friends he often stopped and reasoned with them If the enemy were on that 
hill and we were here with our army who would have the advantage How should we best advance to 
meet the enemy without breaking ranks If we should wish to go back how could we do it If they ran 
how ought we pursue them And he would suggest to them as he went all the things that could happen 
to an army He would listen to their opinion and state his confirming it with reasons so that by these 
continual discussions there could never arise in time of war any unexpected circumstances that he could 
not deal with 
 
But to exercise his mind the prince should read histories and study there the actions of great men to see 
how they have conducted themselves in war to examine the causes of their victories and defeats so as to 
avoid the latter and imitate the former Above all a prince should do as great men did to take as a model 
one who had been praised and famous before them and whose achievements and deeds they always kept 
in mind Thus it is said Alexander the Great imitated Achilles Caesar imitated Alexander and Scipio 

 

 

 
imitated Cyrus Whoever reads the life of Cyrus written by Xenophon will recognize afterwards in the 
life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory and how in his behaviour friendliness kindness and 
generosity Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon A wise 
prince ought to observe such rules and never in peaceful times stand idle He should actively increase his 
resources in such a way that they may be available to him in difficult times so that if fortune changes it 
will find him prepared to resist her blows 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES ARE PRAISED OR 
BLAMED 
 
It remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subjects and friends And 
as I know that many have written on this point I expect I shall be considered too bold in mentioning it 
again especially as in discussing it I shall not follow the methods of other people But it being my 
intention to write something which shall be useful to him who reads it it appears to me more appropriate 
to follow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it Many have imagined republics and 
principalities which in fact have never been known or seen How one actually lives is far distant from 
how one ought to live Anyone who neglects what is done for what ought to be done sooner brings about 
his ruin rather than his preservation A man who wishes to act entirely in a virtuous way is soon destroyed 
among so much that is evil in the world 
 
Hence a prince who wishes to survive must know how to do wrong and how to do or not do wrong 
according to necessity Therefore putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince and 
discussing those which are real I say that all men when they are spoken of and chiefly princes for being 
more highly placed are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise 
Thus one has the reputation of being liberal another mean One is said to be generous one greedy one 
cruel one kind one disloyal another faithful one weak and cowardly another bold and brave one 
friendly another proud one pleasure loving another restrained one sincere another not truthful one 
hard another easy one serious another foolish one religious another unbelieving and the like And I 
know that everyone will confess that it would be most worthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities 
that are considered good But because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed in any one 
person for human conditions do not permit it it is necessary for him to be sufficiently careful so that he 
may know how to avoid the criticism of those things considered bad which would lose him his state 
Also he should avoid if it is possible bad behaviour which would not lose him his state but if this is not 
possible he may with less hesitation do it Moreover he need not feel uneasy about being criticised for 
that bad behaviour which is necessary to maintain the state because if everything is considered carefully 
it will be found that something which looks like virtue if followed would be his ruin while something 
else which looks wrong may bring him security and wealth 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING GENEROSITY AND MEANNESS 
 
Commencing then with the first of the characteristics mentioned above it would be nice to have the 
reputation of being generous Nevertheless generosity exercised in a way that does not bring you the 

 

 

 
reputation for it injures you If one shows generosity honestly and as it should be shown it may not 
become known and you will not avoid the criticism of its opposite meanness Therefore anyone wishing 
to maintain the reputation of being generous has to keep on being more and more generous As a result a 
prince thus inclined will consume all his property in such acts In the end he will have to unnecessarily 
exploit his people and tax them and do everything he can to get money This will soon make him 
disliked by his subjects and becoming poor he will be little valued by anyone Thus with his generosity 
having offended many and rewarded few he is affected by the very first trouble Recognizing this 
himself and wishing to draw back from it he runs at once into the criticism of being mean 
 
Therefore a prince not being able to exercise this virtue of generosity in such a way that it is recognized 
except to his cost if he is wise ought not to fear the reputation of being mean In time he will come to be 
highly regarded seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough that he can defend himself against 
all attacks and is able to carry out projects without placing a heavy load on his people Thus he exercises 
generosity towards all from whom he does not take who are many and meanness towards those to whom 
he does not give who are few 
 
We have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean the rest 
have failed Pope Julius the Second was assisted in becoming Pope by a reputation for generosity 
However he did not try to keep it up afterwards when he made war on the King of France He made 
many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on his subjects for he supplied his additional 
expenses out of his continued care with money The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or 
conquered in so many difficult adventures if he had been considered generous A prince therefore 
provided that he does not have to rob his subjects can defend himself does not become poor and 
despised and is not forced to exploit the people ought not to worry about having a reputation for being 
mean because it is one of those bad characteristics which will enable him to govern 
 
And if any one should say Caesar obtained an empire by generosity and many others have reached the 
highest positions by having been generous and by being considered so I answer Either you are a prince 
in fact or on the way to becoming one In the first case this generosity is dangerous In the second case it 
is very necessary to be considered generous and Caesar was one of those who wished to become 
powerful in Rome But if he had survived after becoming so and had not controlled his expenses he 
would have destroyed his government And if anyone should reply Many have been princes and have 
done great things with armies who have been considered very generous I reply Either a prince spends 
that which is his own or his subjects or else that of others In the first case he ought to be careful in the 
second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for generosity And to the prince who goes forth with his 
army supporting it by taking what he finds around him handling that which belongs to others this 
generosity is necessary otherwise he would not be followed by soldiers You can be a ready giver of that 
which is neither yours nor your subjects as were Cyrus Caesar and Alexander because it does not take 
away your reputation if you waste what belonged to others but adds to it It is only wasting your own 
possessions that injures you 
 
Nothing disappears so rapidly as generosity Even while you exercise it you lose the power to do so and 
so become either poor or despised or else in avoiding poverty you exploit the people and become hated 
A prince should guard himself above all things against being despised and hated Generosity leads you 
to both Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings criticism without hatred than 
to be forced through seeking a reputation for generosity to get a reputation for exploiting people which 
causes criticism with hatred 
 

 

 

 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING CRUELTY AND KINDNESS AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED 
THAN FEARED 
 
Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above every prince ought to desire to be considered kind 
and not cruel Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this kindness Cesare Borgia was 
considered cruel but notwithstanding his cruelty calmed the Romagna unified it and restored it to peace 
and loyalty And if this is carefully considered he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the 
Florentine people who to avoid a reputation for cruelty permitted Pistoia to be destroyed Therefore a 
prince so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal ought not to mind the criticism of cruelty By 
making an example of a few people he will be more merciful than those who through too much mercy 
allow rebellions to arise from which follow murders or robberies These are likely to injure the whole 
people while those killings which are commanded by the prince only affect the individual 
 
And of all princes it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the reputation for cruelty This is because 
new states are full of dangers 
 
Nevertheless a prince ought to be slow to believe and to act and should not show fear He should proceed 
in a calm manner with care and concern for others so that too much confidence does not make him 
careless and too much distrust does not make him always suspicious 
 
Related to this a question arises whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved It may 
be answered that one should wish to be both but because it is difficult to unite them in one person it is 
much safer to be feared than loved when only one is possible The reason for this is that in general men 
are ungrateful inconstant false cowardly and greedy As long as you succeed they are yours entirely  
they will offer you their blood property life and children when the need is far distant But when the 
need approaches they turn against you A prince who relying entirely on their promises has neglected 
other ways of protecting himself will be ruined Friendships that are obtained by payments and not by 
greatness or nobility of mind may indeed be earned but they are not secured and in time of need cannot 
be relied upon Men are less worried about offending one who is loved than one who is feared Love is 
preserved by the link of gratefulness which owing to the weak nature of men is broken at every 
opportunity for their advantage but fear preserves you by a fear of punishment which never fails 
 
Nevertheless a prince ought to encourage fear in such a way that if he does not win love he avoids 
hatred He can carry on very well being feared while he is not hated which will always be as long as he 
keeps away from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women But when it is necessary 
for him to proceed against the life of someone he must do it with proper justification and for obvious 
reasons But above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others because men more quickly 
forget the death of their father than the loss of their inheritance Besides it is always easy to create 
reasons for taking away property Anyone who has once begun to live by robbery will always find reasons 
for seizing what belongs to others But reasons for taking life on the other hand are more difficult to find 
and are hard to keep justifying But when a prince is with his army and has hundreds of soldiers under his 
command then it is necessary for him to not worry about having a reputation for cruelty because without 
it he will not keep his army united or disposed to do its duties 
 
Among the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is described that having led an enormous army 

 

 

 
composed of various races of men to fight in foreign lands no disagreements arose either among them or 
against the prince no matter whether things were going badly or well This arose from nothing else than 
his inhuman cruelty which with his boundless courage made him respected and terrible in the sight of 
his soldiers Without that cruelty his other virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect Shortsighted 
writers admire his deeds from one point of view and from another criticise the principal cause of them 
Evidence for this can be seen in the case of Scipio that most excellent man not only of his own times but 
within the memory of man against whom nevertheless his army rebelled in Spain This arose from 
nothing but his too great kindness which gave his soldiers more freedom than is consistent with military 
discipline For this he was criticised in the Senate by Fabius Maximus and called a bad leader Also 
because of his easy nature he did not punish one of his officers who exploited the Locrians Someone in 
the Senate wishing to excuse him said there were many men who knew much better how not to make 
errors than to correct the errors of others This kindness as a commander would have eventually destroyed 
Scipios reputation and glory Fortunately he was under the control of the Senate so this dangerous 
characteristic not only remained hidden but contributed to his glory 
 
Returning to the question of being feared or loved I come to the conclusion that because men love 
according to their own will and fear according to the will of the prince a wise prince should establish 
himself on that which is in his own control and not in the control of others He must try however to avoid 
hatred 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH 
 
Everyone admits how good it is in a prince to keep faith and to live with integrity and not with trickery 
Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith 
of little account and have known how to get their way through cheating In the end they have overcome 
those who have relied on their word You must know there are two ways of winning one by the rules and 
the other by force The first method is suited to men the second to beasts But because the first is 
frequently not sufficient it is necessary to use the second Therefore it is necessary for a prince to 
understand how to use the ways of both the beast and the man This has been taught by example to 
princes by ancient writers who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to 
Chiron who was half horse and half man to nurse who brought them up in his discipline This means that 
they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half human So it is necessary for a prince to know 
how to make use of both natures and that one without the other is not sufficient A prince therefore 
being forced knowingly to adopt the beast ought to choose the fox and the lion because the lion cannot 
defend himself against traps and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves Therefore it is necessary 
to be a fox to discover the traps and a lion to frighten the wolves Those who rely simply on the lion do 
not understand what they are doing Therefore a wise lord cannot nor ought he keep faith when such 
promises may be turned against him and when the reasons that caused him to promise no longer exist If 
men were entirely good this principle would not hold but because they are bad and will not keep faith 
with you you too are not bound to observe it with them There will never be a shortage of good reasons to 
excuse going back on your word Endless modern examples of this could be given showing how many 
agreements have been broken by princes and how he who has known best how to employ the fox has 
succeeded best 
 
But it is necessary to know how to hide this characteristic well and to be a great pretender People are so 
simple and so subject to present necessities that anyone who seeks to deceive will always find someone 

 

 

 
who will allow himself to be deceived One recent example I cannot pass over in silence Pope Alexander 
the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men nor ever thought of doing otherwise He always found people 
to fool because there never was a man who could so convincingly say something was true and promise 
something and yet be so unlikely to do it Nevertheless his lies always succeeded according to his wishes 
because he understood this side of mankind very well 
 
Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have described but it is very 
necessary to appear to have them And I shall dare to say this also that to have these qualities and always 
to observe them is dangerous and that to appear to have them is useful A prince should appear merciful 
faithful kind religious upright but should be flexible enough to make use of the opposite qualities when 
it is necessary 
 
And you have to understand this that a prince especially a new one cannot do all those things for which 
men are praised being often forced in order to maintain the state to act contrary to honesty friendship 
kindness and religion Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as 
the winds and variations of fortune force it Yet as I have said above a prince should not to turn away 
from the good if he can avoid doing so but if it is truly necessary then he should know how to set about 
it 
 
For this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not full of 
the five qualities mentioned above so that he may appear to everyone who sees and hears him completely 
merciful faithful kind upright and religious There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this 
last quality Men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand because everybody can see you but 
few come in touch with you Everyone sees what you appear to be but few really know what you are and 
those few dare not oppose the opinion of the many who have the power of the state to defend them In the 
actions of all men and especially of princes which it is not wise to challenge one judges by the result 
 
For that reason let a prince have the credit for conquering and holding his state the means will always be 
considered honest and he will be praised by everybody This is because the common people are always 
influenced by what a thing seems to be and by what results from it In this world only the common people 
matter when their minds are firmly made up 
 
One prince of the present time whom it is not wise to name never preaches anything else but peace and 
good faith and yet to both he is most opposed If he had followed what he preached he would have lost 
his reputation and kingdom many a time 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
THAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING HATED AND DESPISED 
 
I have spoken of the most important characteristics a prince should have and now I wish to discuss the 
others briefly under the general theme that the prince must consider how to avoid those things which will 
make him hated or despised If he can succeed with this he will have done the best he can and he need 
not fear any danger in other criticisms 
 
It makes him hated above all things as I have said to be greedy and to exploit the property and women of 
his subjects and he must avoid doing this And when neither their property nor their honour is threatened 

 

 

 
the majority of men live happily and the prince has only to deal with the ambition of a few whom he can 
easily control in many ways 
 
A prince is despised if he is considered changeable foolish weak mean and uncertain A prince should 
avoid these characteristics In his actions he should try to show greatness courage seriousness and 
strength In his private dealings with his subjects he should show that his judgments must be followed 
and he should maintain himself with such a reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get 
round him 
 
A prince who shows these good qualities will be highly respected and such a person can only be attacked 
with difficulty For this reason a prince ought to have two fears one from within on account of his 
subjects the other from without on account of external powers From the latter he is defended by being 
well armed and having good friends and if he is well armed he will have good friends Affairs will 
always remain quiet within when they are quiet outside unless they have been already disturbed by 
conspiracy and even if affairs outside are disturbed if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as 
I have said as long as he does not despair he will resist every attack 
 
But concerning his subjects when affairs outside are disturbed he only has to fear that his subjects will 
conspire secretly A prince can easily secure himself from this by avoiding being hated and despised and 
by keeping the people satisfied with him It is extremely important for him to do this as I have said above 
at length And one of the most effective remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be 
hated and despised by the people Any conspirator always expects to please the people by the princes 
removal But when the conspirator can only look forward to offending them he will not have the courage 
to take such a course because the difficulties that face a conspirator are infinite As experience shows 
there have been many conspiracies but few have been successful A conspirator cannot act alone nor can 
he take a companion except from those whom he believes to be dissatisfied As soon as you have opened 
your mind to a dissatisfied person you have given him the material with which to satisfy himself because 
by informing on you he can look for every advantage So because of the certain gains from informing and 
the uncertain gains and certain dangers from conspiring he must be a very true friend or a thoroughly 
determined enemy of the prince to keep faith with you 
 
On the side of the conspirator there is nothing but fear jealousy and the prospect of punishment On the 
side of the prince there is the power of the principality the laws the protection of friends and the state to 
defend him If we add to all these things the popular support of the people it is impossible that any one 
should be so foolish as to conspire Whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before he carries out his 
plan in this case he has also to fear what follows the crime because on account of it he has the people for 
an enemy and thus cannot hope for any escape 
 
Endless examples could be given on this subject but I will be content with one which happened within 
the memory of our fathers Annibale Bentivogli who was prince in Bologna grandfather of the present 
Annibale was murdered by the Canneschi who had conspired against him and all but one of his family 
a very young child called Giovanni were killed Immediately after Annibale was killed the people rose 
and murdered all the Canneschi This sprung from the popular love which the house of Bentivogli 
enjoyed in those days in Bologna This love was so great that after the death of Annibale although none 
remained there who was able to rule the state the Bolognese having information that there was one of the 
Bentivogli family in Florence sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city even 
though he was thought to be the son of a poor worker It was ruled by him until the surviving child 
Giovanni was old enough to take over the government 

 

 

 
 
For this reason I consider that a prince ought not to worry about conspiracies when his people have love 
and respect him But when the people are hostile to him and bear hatred towards him he ought to fear 
everything and everybody Well ordered states and wise princes have taken every care to keep the nobles 
happy and to keep the people satisfied and contented for this is one of the most important goals a prince 
can have 
 
Among the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France and in it are found many good 
institutions on which the liberty and security of the king depends Of these the first is the parliament and 
its authority The person who founded the kingdom knowing the ambition of the nobility and their 
boldness considered that there needed to be a way to control them On the other side knowing the hatred 
of the people founded in fear against the nobles he wished to protect the people However he did not 
want this to be the particular responsibility of the king Therefore to take away the criticism which the 
king would face from the nobles for favouring the people and from the people for favouring the nobles he 
set up the parliament which would be one who could beat down the great and favour the lesser without 
the king being blamed You could not have a better or more effective arrangement or a greater source of 
security to the king and kingdom From this one can draw another important conclusion that princes 
ought to leave affairs which may upset some people to the management of others and keep those which 
will make people happy in their own hands However I consider that a prince ought to take care of the 
nobles but not so as to make himself hated by the people 
 
It may appear perhaps to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that 
many of them would be an example contrary to my opinion seeing that some of them lived nobly and 
showed great qualities of soul but nevertheless they lost their empire or were killed by subjects who 
conspired against them Wishing therefore to answer these objections I will describe the characters of 
some of the emperors I will show that the causes of their ruin were not different from those described by 
me At the same time I will submit for consideration only those things that are relevant for studying the 
affairs of those times 
 
It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the 
philosopher down to Maximinus They were Marcus and his son Commodus Pertinax Julian Severus 
and his son Antoninus Caracalla Macrinus Heliogabalus Alexander and Maximinus 
 
It is necessary to note that whereas in other principalities a prince only has to deal with the ambition of 
the nobles and the demands of the people the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to deal 
with the cruelty and greed of their soldiers This was such a difficult matter that it was the ruin of many 
because it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and the people The reason for this was 
that the people loved peace and so they loved a contented emperor The soldiers however loved a warlike 
emperor who was bold cruel and greedy and they were quite willing for the emperor to exercise these 
qualities on the people Then they could get double pay and satisfy their own greed and cruelty Hence it 
happened that those emperors were always thrown out of power who either by birth or training had no 
great authority Most of them especially those who came new to the principality recognizing the 
difficulty of these two opposing forces were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers caring little 
about injuring the people This unfortunately was necessary because as princes cannot help being hated 
by someone they ought in the first place to avoid being hated by everyone When they cannot manage 
this they ought to try most of all to avoid the hatred of the most powerful Therefore those emperors who 
through inexperience had need of special support more readily favoured the soldiers than the people 
Whether this policy worked to their advantage or not depended on whether the prince knew how to 

 

 

 
maintain authority over them 
 
For these reasons Marcus Pertinax and Alexander all being men of modest life lovers of justice 
enemies to cruelty kind and generous to others came to a sad end Marcus alone lived and died 
respected because he had become emperor by hereditary title and owed nothing either to the soldiers or 
the people Afterwards being possessed of many virtues which made him respected he always kept both 
groups in their place while he lived and was neither hated nor despised 
 
But Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers They were accustomed to live 
beyond the rules under Commodus and could not bear the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce 
them Thus having given a cause for hatred to which hatred there was added a lack of respect for him 
because he was old he was destroyed at the very beginning of his administration It should be noted here 
that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad ones Therefore as I said before a prince 
wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil When the principality is in a bad way you have to 
submit to the wishes of who you think you have need of to maintain yourself  it may be either the people 
or the soldiers or the nobles  and then good works will do you harm 
 
But let us come to Alexander who was a man of such great goodness that among the other praises which 
are accorded him is this that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him 
without due process of law Nevertheless being considered too much like a woman and a man who 
allowed himself to be governed by his mother he became despised and the army conspired against him 
and murdered him 
 
Turning now to the opposite characters of Commodus Severus Antoninus Caracalla and Maximinus 
you will find them all cruel and greedy They were men who to satisfy their soldiers did not hesitate to 
commit every kind of wicked act against the people All except Severus came to a bad end In Severus 
there was so much courage that keeping the soldiers friendly although the people were oppressed by 
him he ruled successfully His courage made him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and the 
people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and the former were respectful and satisfied Because 
the actions of this man as a new prince were great I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to be 
the fox and the lion which natures as I have said above it is necessary for a prince to imitate 
 
Knowing the laziness of the Emperor Julian he persuaded the army in Sclavonia of which he was 
captain that it would be right to go to Rome and revenge the death of Pertinax who had been killed by 
the emperors own soldiers Under this pretence without appearing to want to be emperor he moved the 
army towards Rome He reached Italy before it was even known that he had started On his arrival at 
Rome the Senate through fear elected him emperor and killed Julian After this there remained for 
Severus who wished to make himself master of the whole empire two difficulties  one in Asia where 
Niger head of the Asian army had caused himself to be named emperor and the other in the west where 
Albinus also wanted to be emperor As he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both he 
decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus To the latter he wrote that being elected emperor by the 
Senate he was willing to share that honour with him and sent him the title of Caesar and moreover he 
wrote that the Senate had made Albinus his colleague This was all believed by Albinus as true But after 
Severus had conquered and killed Niger and settled affairs in the east he returned to Rome He 
complained to the Senate that Albinus little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him had 
sought to murder him and for this he was forced to punish him Afterwards he sought him out in France 
and took from him his government and life Therefore anyone who carefully examines the actions of this 
man will find him a most courageous lion and a most tricky fox He will find him feared and respected by 

 

 

 
everyone and not hated by the army It is not surprising that he a new man was able to hold the empire 
so well because his reputation for courage always protected him from that hatred which the people might 
have conceived against him for his violence 
 
His son Antoninus was a very capable man and had very excellent qualities These made him admired by 
the people and accepted the soldiers He was a warlike man full of energy who despised all delicate food 
and other rich delights This caused him to be loved by the armies Nevertheless his fierceness and 
cruelties were great and far beyond belief After endless single murders he killed a large number of the 
people of Rome and all those of Alexandria He became hated by the whole world and feared by those he 
had around him to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a soldier It must be 
noted here that killings like this which are done with a resolved courage by those who are not afraid to 
die cannot be avoided by princes Anyone who does not fear to die can do them But a prince may fear 
them less because they are very rare He only has to be careful not to do any serious injury to those whom 
he employs or has around him in the service of the state Antoninus had not been careful about this He 
had dishonourably killed a brother of that soldier whom also he threatened each day yet retained in his 
own personal soldiers This as it turned out was a foolish thing to do and proved to be the emperors 
ruin 
 
But let us come to Commodus It should have been very easy for him to hold on to the empire Being the 
son of Marcus he had inherited it and he only had to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his 
people and soldiers But he was by nature cruel and hard he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and 
allowing them too much freedom so that he could treat the people badly In addition he did not maintain 
the proper respect for his own position often descending to the theatre to compete with soldiers and 
doing wicked things not worthy of the emperor He became despised by the soldiers and being hated by 
one party and despised by the other he was conspired against and killed 
 
It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus He was a very warlike man and the armies being 
disgusted with the weakness of Alexander of whom I have already spoken killed him and elected 
Maximinus as emperor He did not keep this position this for long for two things made him hated and 
despised Firstly he came from a very poor background having once raised sheep This was known by 
everyone and was considered a completely unsuitable background for an emperor Secondly when he 
first became emperor he put off going to Rome and officially taking the position He had also gained a 
reputation for great cruelty by having done many wicked things through his representatives in Rome and 
elsewhere in the empire So the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and by fear 
of his cruelty First Africa rebelled then the Senate with all the people of Rome and all Italy conspired 
against him to which may be added his own army The army besieging Aquileia and meeting with 
difficulties in taking it were disgusted with his cruelties and fearing him less when they found so many 
people against him murdered him 
 
I do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus Macrinus or Julian who being thoroughly despised were quickly 
wiped out I will bring this discussion to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have much less 
trouble with this difficulty of giving too much satisfaction to their soldiers because notwithstanding one 
has to keep them happy that is soon done None of these princes have armies that are experienced in the 
governing and administration of parts of an empire as were the armies of the Roman Empire Whereas 
then it was more necessary to give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people it is now more necessary 
for all princes except the leader of the Turks and the ruler of Egypt to satisfy the people rather the 
soldiers because the people are the most powerful 
 

 

 

 

From the above I have excluded the leader of the Turks who always keeps twelve thousand foot soldiers 
and fifteen thousand horse soldiers round him on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom 
It is thus necessary that putting aside every consideration for the people he should keep them his friends 
The kingdom of the Egypt is similar being entirely in the hands of soldiers It follows again that without 
regard to the people the leader must keep the soldiers as his friends But you must note that the state of 
Egypt is unlike all other principalities It is most like that controlled by the Pope It cannot be called either 
an hereditary or a newly formed principality because the sons of the old prince do not inherit The person 
who is elected to that position by those who have authority and his sons remain only as nobles Because 
this is an ancient custom it cannot be called a new principality and so there are none of those difficulties 
in it that are met with in new ones Thus although the prince is new the constitution of the state is old 
and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were inheriting it 
 
But returning to the main subject I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either being 
hated or despised has resulted in the fall of the emperors mentioned above It will also be recognized how 
it happened that a number of them acting in one way and a number in another only one in each way 
came to a happy end and the rest to unhappy ones It would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax 
and Alexander being new princes to imitate Marcus who inherited the principality Likewise it would 
have been completely destructive to Caracalla Commodus and Maximinus to have imitated Severus 
They did not have sufficient courage to enable them to follow in his footsteps Therefore a prince new to 
the principality cannot imitate the actions of Marcus nor again is it necessary to follow those of 
Severus But a prince ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary to establish his state 
and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
ARE CASTLES AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH PRINCES OFTEN USE ADVANTAGEOUS 
OR HURTFUL 
 
Some princes in order to hold the state securely have disarmed their subjects others have kept their 
subject towns divided by setting up opposing groups others have encouraged attacks against themselves 
others have tried to win over those whom they did not trust in the beginning of their governments some 
have built castles some have destroyed them One cannot give a final judgment on all of these things 
unless one possesses the particular details of those states in which a decision has to be made Nevertheless 
I will speak as comprehensively as possible on these matters 
 
There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects Rather when he has found them disarmed 
he has always armed them By arming them those arms become yours those men who were distrusted 
become faithful and those who were faithful are kept so and your subjects become your supporters 
Although all subjects cannot be armed yet when those whom you do arm are benefited the others can be 
handled more freely This difference in their treatment which they quite understand makes the former 
your supporters and the latter considering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and 
service should have the most reward excuse you But when you disarm them you at once offend them by 
showing that you distrust them either for cowardice or for lack of loyalty Either of these opinions creates 
hatred against you and because you cannot remain unarmed it follows that you turn to mercenaries 
which are of the character already shown Even if they happen to be good they would not be sufficient to 
defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects Therefore as I have said a new prince in a 

 

 

 

new principality has always distributed arms History is full of examples But when a prince acquires a 
new state which he adds to his old one then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state except those 
who have helped him in acquiring it These people with time and opportunity should be made soft and 
weak and matters should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state should be your 
own soldiers who in your old state were living near you 
 
Those who were considered to be wise were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by 
opposing groups and Pisa by castles With this idea they encouraged quarrels in some of their acquired 
towns so as to keep possession of them more easily This may have been good enough in those times 
when Italy was in a way balanced but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a rule for today I do not 
believe that opposed groups can ever be of use Rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you 
in divided cities you are quickly lost because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and 
the other will not be able to resist The Venetians influenced as I believe by the above reasons 
encouraged the Guelph and Ghibelline groups in their acquired cities Although they never allowed them 
to start killing each other yet they nursed these arguments amongst them so that the citizens caught up 
in their differences would not unite against them This as we saw did not afterwards turn out as 
expected because when the Venetians were beaten at Vaila one party at once took courage and seized 
the state Such methods therefore show weakness in the prince because these opposing groups would 
never be permitted in a strong principality Such methods for enabling one to manage subjects more easily 
are only useful in times of peace But if war comes this policy is a mistake 
 
Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the difficulties that face them and a new prince 
has a greater necessity to earn a reputation than an hereditary one Therefore fortune especially when she 
desires to make a new prince great causes enemies to arise and conspire against him in order that he may 
have the opportunity of overcoming them and thus climb higher as if by a ladder which his enemies have 
raised For this reason many consider that a wise prince when he has the opportunity ought to create 
some enemies against himself so that having crushed them his reputation may rise higher 
 
Princes especially new ones have found more loyalty and assistance in those men who in the beginning 
of their rule were distrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted Pandolfo Petrucci 
prince of Siena ruled his state more by those who had been distrusted than by others But on this question 
one cannot speak generally for it varies so much with the individual I will only say this that those men 
who at the commencement of a principality have been hostile if they really need assistance to support 
themselves can always be turned into supporters with the greatest ease They will be tightly bound to 
serve the prince faithfully because they know it is very necessary for them through their actions to change 
the bad opinion which the prince had formed of them Thus the prince always extracts more profit from 
them than from those who serving him in too much security may neglect his affairs Related to this I 
must not fail to warn a prince who by means of secret favours has acquired a new state He must 
carefully consider the reasons which induced those to favour him who did so If it was not a natural 
feeling towards him but only discontent with their government then he will only keep them friendly with 
great trouble and difficulty because it will be impossible to satisfy them And weighing well the reasons 
for this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern affairs we shall find that it is 
easier for the prince to make friends of those men who were contented under the former government and 
are therefore his enemies than of those who being discontented with it were favourable to him and 
encouraged him to seize it 
 
It has been a custom with princes in order to hold their states more securely to build castles that may 

 

 

 

serve as a warning for those who might design to work against them and as a place of protection from a 
first attack I praise this system because it has been made use of formerly Notwithstanding that Nicolo 
Vitelli in our times has been seen to destroy two castles in Citta di Castello so that he might keep that 
state Guido Ubaldo Duke of Urbino on returning to his principality after he had been driven out by 
Cesare Borgia destroyed all the castles in that place down to the foundations and considered that without 
them it would be more difficult to lose it The Bentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision 
Castles therefore are useful or not according to circumstances If they do you good in one way they 
injure you in another This issue can be reasoned thus the prince who has more to fear from the people 
than from foreigners ought to build castles but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the 
people ought to leave them alone The castle of Milan built by Francesco Sforza has made and will 
make more trouble for the house of Sforza than any other rebellion in the state For this reason the best 
possible castle is not to be hated by the people Although you may hold the castles yet they will not save 
you if the people hate you There will always be foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against 
you It has not been seen in our times that such castles have been of use to any prince unless to the 
Countess of Forli when the Count Girolamo her husband was killed With the castle she was able to 
resist the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan and thus recover her state The circumstances 
were such at that time that the foreigners could not assist the people But castles were of little value to her 
afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her and when the people her enemy were helped by foreigners 
Therefore it would have been safer for her both then and before not to have been hated by the people 
than to have had the castles All these things considered then I shall praise him who builds castles as well 
as him who does not and I shall blame whoever trusting in them cares little about being hated by the 
people 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
HOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN A REPUTATION 
 
Nothing makes a prince so famous as great achievements and setting a fine example We have in our time 
Ferdinand of Aragon the present King of Spain He can almost be called a new prince because he has 
risen by success and glory from being an insignificant king to be the most famous king in our part of the 
world If you examine his deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary When he 
first became king he attacked Granada and this was the foundation of his success He did this quietly at 
first and without any fear of others standing against him because he kept the minds of the barons of 
Castile occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations Thus they did not perceive 
that by these means he was acquiring power and authority over them He was able with the money of the 
Church and of the people to sustain his armies and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military 
skill which has since distinguished him In addition always using religion as a justification in order to 
undertake greater schemes he devoted himself with great cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom 
of the Moors There could not be a more admirable example nor one more rare Using this same reason 
he attacked Africa he began fighting in Italy and he has finally attacked France Thus his achievements 
and designs have always been so remarkable that they have kept the minds of his people in admiration 
and kept them occupied with carrying them out His actions have arisen in such a way one out of the 
other that people have never been given enough time to work steadily against him 
 
It greatly assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal affairs similar to those which are told of 
Bernabo da Milano When he had the opportunity in civil life to take account of someone who had done 

 

 

 

some extraordinary thing either good or bad he would use some method of rewarding or punishing him 
which would be much spoken about A prince ought above all things to always try in every action to 
develop the reputation of being a great and remarkable man 
 
A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or an absolute enemy that is to say when 
without any reservation he declares himself in favour of one party against the other This course will 
always be more advantageous than standing neutral If two of your powerful neighbours come to blows 
you have either to fear the winner or not In either case it will always be more advantageous for you to 
support one of them and to actively make war If you do not declare yourself you will invariably be 
attacked by the conqueror to the pleasure and satisfaction of the loser and you will have no reasons to 
offer nor anything to protect or to shelter you The conqueror does not want doubtful friends who will not 
aid him in the time of difficulty and the loser will not protect you because you did not willingly sword in 
hand follow his fate 
 
Antiochus went into Greece being sent for by the Aetolians to drive out the Romans He sent messengers 
to the Achaeans who were friends of the Romans urging them to remain neutral On the other hand the 
Romans urged them to take up arms This question came to be discussed in the council of the Achaeans 
where the representative of Antiochus urged them to stand neutral To this the Roman representative 
answered As for that which has been said that it is better and more advantageous for your state not to 
interfere in our war nothing can be more wrong By not interfering you will be left without favour or 
consideration and will become the prize of the conqueror Thus it will always happen that the one who 
is not your friend will demand your neutrality while the one who is your friend will beg you to declare 
yourself with arms Weak princes to avoid present dangers generally follow the neutral path and are 
generally ruined But when a prince declares himself courageously in favour of one side if the party with 
whom he joins himself conquers although the conqueror may be powerful and may have him at his 
mercy yet he is indebted to him and a bond of friendship is established Men are never so low as to 
become a symbol of ungratefulness by oppressing you Victories after all are never so complete that the 
winner must not show some regard especially to justice But if the one you support loses you may be 
sheltered by him and while he is able he may aid you and you can become companions on a fortune that 
may rise again 
 
In the second case when those who fight are of such a character that you do not feel threatened by 
whoever wins it becomes even more important to support one side By doing this you assist at the 
destruction of one by the aid of another Because of your much needed assistance the conqueror remains 
dependent on you It must be noted here that a prince should never join with one more powerful than 
himself for the purposes of attacking others unless it is absolutely necessary If he conquers you are at his 
mercy and as much as possible princes ought to avoid being in a weaker position to anyone The 
Venetians joined with France against the Duke of Milan which caused their ruin and could have been 
avoided But when it cannot be avoided as happened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent 
armies to attack Lombardy then in such a case for the above reasons the prince ought to support one of 
the parties 
 
No Government should imagine that it can choose perfectly safe courses It should expect to have to take 
very doubtful ones because in ordinary affairs one never seeks to avoid one trouble without running into 
another Wisdom consists of knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles and how to choose the 
lesser evil 
 

 

 

 

A prince ought also be seen to support people of ability and to honour the skilled in every art At the 
same time he should encourage his citizens to perform their jobs peacefully both in commerce and 
agriculture and in every other field so that people are not worried about increasing their possessions for 
fear that they might be taken away from them or about opening up trade for fear of taxes The prince 
ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do things like these which may bring honour to his city or 
state 
 
In addition a prince ought to amuse the people with entertainments and ceremonies at appropriate times 
of the year and as every city is divided into tradesmens organisations or into societies he ought to 
respect such groups and associate with them sometimes He should show himself to be an example of 
good behaviour and generosity but nevertheless always maintain the awareness of his high rank 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
CONCERNING THE PERSONAL STAFF OF PRINCES 
 
The choice of staff is very important to a prince and they are good or not according to the discrimination 
of the prince The first opinion which one forms of a prince and of his capability is by observing the 
people he has around him When they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise because 
he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful But when they are otherwise one 
cannot form a good opinion of him for the prime error which he made was in choosing them 
 
Everyone who knew Antonio da Venafro as the minister of Pandolfo Petrucci prince of Siena who would 
consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro on his staff There are three classes of 
minds one which understands by itself another which appreciates what others understood and a third 
which neither understands by itself nor through the explanation of others The first is the most excellent 
the second is good and the third is useless Therefore it follows necessarily that if Pandolfo was not in 
the first rank he was certainly in the second Whenever one has sufficient judgment to know good and 
bad when it is said and done although he himself may not have the initiative yet he can recognize the 
good and the bad in his staff The one he can praise and the other correct Thus the person cannot hope to 
deceive him and is kept honest 
 
But to enable a prince to form an opinion of his staff there is one test which never fails When you see 
someone thinking more of his own interests than of yours and seeking inwardly his own profit in 
everything such a man will never make a good servant Nor will you ever be able to trust him because he 
who has the state of another in his hands ought never to think of himself He should always think of his 
prince and never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not concerned 
 
On the other hand to keep his servant honest the prince ought to reward him honouring him enriching 
him doing him kindnesses sharing the honours and concerns with him At the same time let him see that 
he cannot stand alone so that many honours may not make him desire more many riches make him wish 
for more and that many problems may make him afraid to take chances When therefore servants and 
princes towards servants are thus disposed they can trust each other But when it is otherwise the end 
will always be bad for either one or the other 
 
 

 

 

 

CHAPTER  
 
HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED 
 
I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject because it is a danger from which it is 
difficult to protect princes unless they are very careful and discriminating It is that of flatterers The 
courts are full of such people because men are so wrapped up in their own affairs and in a way so 
deceived in them that it is difficult to protect them from this danger If they wish to defend themselves 
they run the danger of becoming despised The only way to guard yourself from flatterers is to let people 
understand that to tell you the truth does not offend you However when everyone feels free to tell you 
the truth respect for you goes down 
 
Therefore a wise prince ought to follow a third course by choosing the wise men in his state and giving to 
them alone the liberty of speaking the truth to him and then only of those things of which he inquires and 
of none others However he ought to question them about everything and listen to their opinions and 
afterwards form his own conclusions With these councillors separately and collectively he ought to 
behave in such a way that each of them should know that the more freely he speaks the more he will be 
preferred Outside of these he should listen to no one pursue the thing resolved on and stick to his 
decisions He who does otherwise is either beaten by flatterers or is so often changed by varying opinions 
that he is laughed at 
 
I wish to give a modern example of this Fra Luca the man of affairs to Maximilian the present emperor 
speaking of the emperor said He consulted with no one yet never got his own way in anything This 
arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the above The emperor is a secretive man  he 
does not communicate his plans to any one nor does he receive opinions on them But because in 
carrying them into effect they become revealed and known they are at once argued against by the men 
whom he has around him and he being easily led is made to change them Hence it follows that those 
things he does one day he undoes the next and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do 
and no one can rely on his decisions 
 
A prince therefore always ought to take advice but only when he wishes and not when others wish He 
ought to make it clear that he does not want advice unless he asks for it However he ought to constantly 
inquire and afterwards be a patient listener concerning the things he asked about Also on learning that 
anyone on any matter has not told him the truth he should let his anger be felt 
 
There may be some who think that a prince might appear to be wise not through his own ability but 
because he has good advisers around him Such a belief is clearly wrong because a prince who is not 
wise himself will never take good advice unless by chance he has yielded his affairs entirely to one 
person who happens to be a very clever man In this case indeed he may be well governed but it would 
not be for long because such a governor would in a short time take his state away from him 
 
If a prince who is not wise takes advice from more than one person he will always get different bits of 
advice and he will not know how to accommodate them Each of the advisors will think of his own 
interests and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them This is typical because 
men will always deceive you unless they are kept honest by constraint Therefore it must be inferred that 
good advice no matter where it comes from is a result of the wisdom of the prince The wisdom of the 
prince does not come from good advice 

 

 

 

 
 
CHAPTER  
 
WHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES 
 
The previous suggestions if they are carefully followed will enable a new prince to appear well 
established and make him at once more secure in the state than if he had been long seated there This is 
important because the actions of a new prince are more critically observed than those of an hereditary 
one When princes are seen to be capable they gain more men and make them more loyal than ancient 
blood This is because men are attracted more by the present than by the past When they find the present 
good they enjoy it and seek no further They will also strongly defend a prince if he does not fail them in 
other things Thus it will be a double glory for him to have established a new principality and enriched 
and strengthened it with good laws good arms good friends and good leadership Similarly it will be a 
double dishonour for someone who is born a prince to lose his state through a lack of wisdom 
 
If we look at those princes who have lost their states in Italy in our times such as the King of Naples the 
Duke of Milan and others there will be found in them firstly one common problem in regard to arms 
from the causes which have already been discussed at length Secondly some will be seen either to have 
had the people hostile or if he has had the people friendly he has not known how to secure the nobles In 
the absence of these problems states that have enough power to keep an army in the field cannot be lost 
 
Philip of Macedon not the father of Alexander the Great but the one who was conquered by Titus 
Quintius did not have a big state compared to the greatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked 
him Yet being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles he sustained the 
war against his enemies for many years and if in the end he lost some of his cities nevertheless he 
retained the kingdom 
 
Therefore our princes should not accuse fortune for the loss of their principalities after so many years 
possession but rather their own laziness In quiet times they never thought there could be change it is a 
common weakness in people not to make any provision in the calm against the storm When afterwards 
the bad times came they thought of running away and not of defending themselves They hoped that the 
people disgusted with the attitude of the conquerors would call them back This course when others fail 
may be good but it is very bad to have neglected all other possibilities for that You should never wish to 
fall because you hoped to find someone later on to restore you This either does not happen or if it does 
it will not be good for your security Being saved is of no use unless it is by your own efforts The only 
reliable certain and lasting ways are those that depend on yourself and your courage 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
WHAT ROLE FORTUNE PLAYS IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO RESIST HER 
 
Many people have had and still have the opinion that the affairs of the world are governed by fortune 
and by God and humans with their wisdom cannot direct them and no one can even help them Because of 
this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs but to let chance govern 
them This opinion has gained more credit in our times because of the great changes in affairs which have 

 

 

 

been seen and may still be seen every day beyond all human prediction Sometimes thinking over this I 
am in some degree inclined to their opinion Nevertheless in order not to destroy our free will I believe 
that fortune decides half of our actions but that she still leaves the other half or perhaps a little less for 
us to direct 
 
I compare fortune to one of those great rivers which when in flood covers the plains sweeping away 
trees and buildings bearing away the soil from place to place Everything flies before it all yield to its 
violence without being able in any way to resist it But although its nature is like that it does not follow 
therefore that people when the weather becomes fine should not make preparations both with canals and 
defences so that in the future the rising waters are directed away and their force is not so unrestrained 
and dangerous It is the same with fortune who shows her power where courage has not made 
preparations to resist her She turns her forces where she knows that walls have not been raised to 
constrain her 
 
Now if you consider Italy which is the centre of these changes and which has given them their strength 
you will see it to be an open country without walls and without any defences If it had been defended with 
proper courage as are Germany Spain and France this invasion would not have made such great 
changes or it would not have come at all And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to 
fortune in general 
 
But confining myself more to the particular a prince may be seen to be happy today and ruined tomorrow 
without having shown any change of attitude or character This I believe arises firstly from causes that 
have already been discussed at length namely that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when 
it changes I also believe that he will be successful if he directs his actions according to the spirit of the 
times and that if his actions do not accord with the times he will not be successful Men achieve glory 
and riches by various methods one with caution another with haste one by force another by skill one 
by patience another by its opposite and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by a different method 
One can also see of two cautious men that one attains his end and the other fails Similarly two men 
seem to be equally successful one by being cautious the other by taking risks All these differences arise 
from nothing else except whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times This 
follows from what I have said that two men working differently bring about the same effect and of two 
working similarly one attains his object and the other does not 
 
Changes in personal estate also issue from this If someone governs himself with caution and patience 
and times and affairs come together in the right way then his administration is successful and his fortune 
is made But if times and affairs change he is ruined if he does not change his course of action But a man 
is not often found sufficiently clever to know how to accommodate himself to the change This is because 
he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to do and also because having always been successful 
by acting in one way he cannot be persuaded that it is well to leave it Therefore the cautious man when 
it is time to turn adventurous does not know how to do it hence he is ruined If he had changed his 
conduct with the times fortune would not have changed 
 
Pope Julius the Second went to work boldly and energetically in all his affairs and found the times and 
circumstances conform so well to that line of action that he always met with success Consider his first 
campaign against Bologna when Giovanni Bentivogli was still alive The Venetians were not agreeable 
to it nor was the King of Spain and he had the campaign still under discussion with the King of France 
Nevertheless he personally entered into it with his accustomed boldness and energy a move which made 

 

 

 

Spain and the Venetians stand undecided and passive the latter from fear the former from desire to 
recover the kingdom of Naples On the other hand he managed to involve the King of France because 
that king having observed the movement and wanting to make the Pope his friend so as to humble the 
Venetians found it impossible to refuse him Therefore Julius with his bold action achieved what no other 
pope with simple human wisdom could have done If he had waited in Rome until he could get away 
with his plans arranged and everything fixed as any other pope would have done he would never have 
succeeded because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses and the others would have 
raised a thousand fears 
 
I will leave his other actions alone as they were all similar and they all succeeded because the shortness 
of his life did not let him experience the contrary However if circumstances had arisen which required 
him to go cautiously his ruin would have followed because he would never have deviated from those 
ways to which nature inclined him 
 
I conclude therefore that fortune being changeable and mankind fixed in their ways so long as the two 
are in agreement men are successful but they are unsuccessful when they fall out For my part I consider 
that it is better to be adventurous than cautious because fortune is a woman If you wish to keep her under 
it is necessary to beat and treat her badly She allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather 
than by those who go to work more coldly She is therefore always like a woman a lover of young men 
because they are less cautious more violent and command her with more boldness 
 
 
CHAPTER  
 
A CALL TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE INVADERS 
 
After reflecting on what I have said above I have wondered whether the present times were right for a 
new prince and whether there were elements that would give an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to 
introduce a new order of things which would bring honour to him and good to the people of this country 
It appears to me that so many things now come together to favour a new prince that I never knew a time 
more suitable than the present 
 
And if as I said it was necessary that the people of Israel should be in chains so as to make the ability of 
Moses clear that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the 
soul of Cyrus and that the Athenians should be scattered to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus then at 
the present time in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit it was necessary that Italy should be 
reduced to the conditions that she is now in that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews more 
oppressed than the Persians more scattered than the Athenians without a head without order beaten 
exploited torn invaded and suffering every kind of ill fortune 
 
Although lately some hope may have been shown by one which made us think he was chosen by God to 
save us nevertheless it was afterwards seen that fortune rejected him So Italy left as without life waits 
for someone to heal her wounds and to put an end to the destruction and exploitation of Lombardy to the 
cheating and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany and to clean those running sores It is seen how she 
begs God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs and oppressions It is seen also that 
she is ready and willing to follow a flag if only someone will raise it 
 

 

 

 

Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom Italy can place more hope than in your noble house with 
its courage and fortune favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief and which could 
be made the head of this liberation This will not be difficult if you remember the actions and lives of the 
men I have named Although they were great and wonderful men yet they were only men and each one 
of them had no more opportunity than the present offers Their campaigns were neither more just nor 
easier than this nor was God more their friend than He is yours 
 
On our side there is great justice because that war is just which is necessary and arms are blessed when 
there is no other hope but in them Here there is the greatest willingness and where the willingness is 
great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only imitate those men to whom I have directed your 
attention In addition to this how extraordinary the ways of God have been shown to be beyond example 
the sea is divided a cloud has led the way the rock has poured forth water it has rained food from 
heaven Everything has contributed to your greatness you ought to do the rest God is not willing to do 
everything and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us 
 
It is not surprising that none of the Italians mentioned above have been able to achieve all that is expected 
from your glorious house and that in so many revolutions in Italy and in so many campaigns it has 
always appeared as if military virtue was dead This has happened because the old order of things was not 
good and none of us have known how to find a new one Nothing honours a man more than to establish 
new laws when he himself is newly risen Such things when they are well founded and proper will make 
him loved and admired and in Italy there are great opportunities to do this 
 
Here there is great courage in the limbs while it fails in the head Look carefully at the individual handto
hand fights to see the excellence of the Italians in strength speed and skill But when it comes to armies 
they are hopeless This is entirely the result of poor leadership Those who are capable are not obeyed 
Each one thinks they are capable but none stands out above the rest either in courage or fortune Hence 
for so long a time and during so much fighting in the past twenty years whenever there has been a 
wholly Italian army it has always performed badly The first example of this is Il Taro and then there are 
Allesandria Capua Genoa Vaila Bologna Mestri 
 
If therefore your great house wishes to follow these remarkable men who have saved their country it is 
necessary before all things as a true foundation for every campaign to be provided with your own forces 
because there can be no more faithful truer or better soldiers Although individually they are good 
together they will be much better when they find themselves commanded by their prince respected by 
him and maintained at his expense Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms so that you 
can be defended against foreigners by Italian courage 
 
And although Swiss and Spanish foot soldiers may be considered very strong nevertheless there is a 
weakness in both by reason of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them but might be 
relied upon to defeat them For the Spaniards cannot resist horse soldiers and the Swiss are afraid of foot 
soldiers whenever they encounter them in close fighting Owing to this as has been and may again be 
seen the Spaniards are unable to resist French horse and the Swiss are beaten by Spanish foot soldiers 
Although complete proof of this latter cannot be shown nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the 
battle of Ravenna when the Spanish foot soldiers were faced by German soldiers who fight in the same 
way as the Swiss The Spaniards through skill and speed and with the aid of their shields got in under the 
spears of the Germans and stood out of danger able to attack while the Germans stood helpless If the 
horse soldiers had not quickly attacked all would have been over with them It is possible therefore 

 

 

 

knowing the weaknesses of both these soldiers to invent a new army which will resist attacks by horse 
soldiers and not be afraid of foot soldiers This need not create a new order of arms but may simply be a 
variation upon the old These are the kinds of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a 
new prince 
 
This opportunity therefore ought not to be allowed to pass for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear 
Nor can one express the love with which he would be received in all those parts of Italy which have 
suffered so much from these foreign attacks with what thirst for revenge with what strong faith with 
what devotion with what tears What door would be closed to him Who would refuse obedience to him 
What envy would hinder him What Italian would refuse him to honour him To all of us this present 
situation is unbearable Let therefore your great family take up this task with that courage and hope with 
which all just causes are undertaken so that under its flag our native country may be made great again 
and under your command that saying of Petrarch will be shown to be true 
 
Virtue against fury shall advance the fight 
And in the battle soon shall put to flight 
For the old Roman courage is not dead 
And still burns in the Italians hearts
