THE Phenomenology  of Spirit  firs t pu blished in    is  a  work 
seen by Hegel as a  necessary forepiece  to his philosophical syscid
tem  as  later set  forth  in  the  Encyclopaedia  of the  Philosophical 
Sciences  in  Outline  of     and    but it is  meant  to 
be  a  forepiece  that  can  be  dropped  and  discarded  once  the 
student through deep immersion in its contents has advanced 
through  confusons  and  misunderstanding  to  the  properly 
philosophical point of view It task is to run through in a sciencid
tifically purged  order  the stages in  the  minds necessary procid
gress  from immediate senseconsciousness  to  the  position  of a 
scientific philosophy showing thereby that this  position is  the 
only one that the mind  ctn  take  when it comes  to  the  end of 
the intellectual and spiritqaJ adventures described in the book 
But this sort of history he tells us in Encyclopaedia S necessarily 
had  to  drag  in  more  or  less  out  of place  and  inadequately 
cQaracterized much that wOllld  afterwards  be adequately sCt 
forth in the system and it lso had to bringjn many motivating 
connections  of  wich the  adventuring  mind  was  unaware 
which  explained  why it passed  from  one  phase  of experience 
Of  action to another and yet could not be  set forth  in  the full 
manner whicp  alone would  render them intelligible 

Hegl also in preparing for repubJication of the work  before 
his  death  in    wrote  a  note  which  throws  great  light  on 
his ultimate conception of it It was he writes a peculiar earlier 
work eigentumlichefrbere Arbeit  which ought not to be revised 
since  it  related  to  the  time  at  which  it  was  written  a  time 
at which an abstractAbsolute dominated philosophy  See the 
final  pOlragraphof the first  section of Hoffmeisters  Appendix 
Zur Feststellung  des  Textes  in  the    edition  This note indicid
cates that while Hegel undoubtedly thought that the sequence 
of thollghtphases described  in  the  PhenomnolQgyphases excid
perienced by humanity in the past and recapitulated by Hegel 
in is own thoughtadventures up to and including his own adcid
vance to the position of Science in about was a necessary

sequence  he  still  did  not  think  it  the  only  possible  necessary 
sequence or pathway to Science and certainly not the pathway 
to  Science  that would  be  taken  by men in  the future  or  that 
might have been taken in other cultural and historical settings 
For Hegel makes  plain  by  his  practice  as  well  as  in some  of 
his  utterances  that he does not confuse the necessary  with  the 
unique that he does not identify a necessary sequence of phases 
with  the only  possible  sequence  that can  be  taken  Hegel  was 
obviously  familiar  with  the  branching  variety  of alternative 
proofs  all involving strictly  necessary  steps  that  are  possible 
in  mathematics  and  it is  plain  that  he  did  not  think  that  a 
similar  branching  of proofs  was  impossible  in  his  dialectical 
reasoning Dialectic is  in fact  a  richer and  more supple form 
ofthoughtadvance than mathematical inference for while the 
latter proceeds on lines of strict identity educing only what is 
explicit or almost explicit in some  thoughtpositions  content 
dialectic always makes higherorder comments upon its various 
thoughtpositions  stating  relations  that  carry  us  far  beyond 
theif obvious content What is  obvious  for  example in Being 
is  not its identity with Nothing and what is  obvious in Sensecid
certainty is ootits total lack ofdetermintteness  If mathematicid
cal identities can thus follow different routes to the same or to 
different goals  dialectical commentaries can  even  more obvicid
ously do the same  and Hegel in his  varying treatment of the 
same material in the two Logics andin the Phenomenology shows 
plain recognition of this fact  A necessary connection  whether 
mathematical or dialectical is not psychologically compUlsive 
it represents a  track  that  the  mind  mayor may  not  take  or 
that it mayor may not prefer  to other tracks  on  its journey 
to a given concJusion Thereis no reason then to think that Hegel 
thought that the path tracedin the Phenomenology  though concid
sisting  throughout of necessary  steps  was  the  only  path  that 
the  conscious  spirit could  have  taken  in  rising  from  sensuous 
immediacy to a bsolu te knowledge I t was the pa th that had been 
taken  by the  World  Spirit in past history  and  that had  been 
rehearsed in  the  consciousness  of Hegel  in  whom  the  notion 
of Science first became actual But this involved no pronounce 
ment as  to  what pathway to  Science would  be  taken  by  men 
in the future  nor as  to what pathway would  have  been  taken 
in other thinkable  worldsituations For Hegel admits an  ele

ment of the sheerly contingent and therefore also of the sheerly 
possible  in  nature and  history 

The  sequence  of phases  to  be  studied  in  the  Phenomenology 
therefore involves a fine blend of the contingently historical and 
the logically necessary  Its successive phases  bring out what is 
logically implicit in its earlier phases in the Hegelian  sense  of 
representing  throughout an insightful  higherorder comment 
on previous  contents  but  they also  only bring  out a  series  of 
implications actually embodied in past history and in Hegels 
own  thoughthistory  Hegel  we  know  did  not desire  to  step 
out of his  own time and his own thoughtsituation  the philoscid
opher as  he was  later to say on page   of the  Preface  to  the 
Philosophy  qf Right is  necessarily a  son of his  own time  and his 
philosophy is  that time comprehended in thought  To seek  to 
transcend ones time is  only  he  says  to venture into  the  soft 
element of fancy and opinion The pathway to  Science taken 
in  the  future  may  therefore  differ  profoundly  from  the  one 
studied in the Phenomenology it may involve many abbreviations 
and aternative routings It is  not  however  profitable to concid
sider such for us empty possibilities  The path to  be considered 
is  the  one  actually  taken in  the  past  and  terminating  in  the 
present  It is  however for all that a  path involving necessary 
implications and developments  which  will  be  preserved in  all 
paths  taken in  the future  and in the  terminus  to  which  these 
lead  For  on  Hegels view  all  dialectical  thoughtpaths  lead 
to the Absolute Idea and to the knowledge of it which is itself 
It is  necessary  in considering  the  Phenomenology  as  in  concid

sidering  al  Hegels  other  writings  to  stress  this  initial  point 
that  though Hegel may mention much that is  contingent and 
historical and may refuse  to break wholly loose  from  this  his 
concern is always with the BegrijJe or universal notional shapes 
that are evinced in fact and history and with the ways in which 
these  align themselves and  lead  on  to  one  another  and  can in 
fact ultimately be regarded as distinguishable facets ofa single 
allinclusive  universal or concept  See  for  example  Phenomcid
enology     pp     Encyclopaedia  I   For Hegel

FOREWORD 

the universal is no strengthless arbitrary distillation of the comcid
mon features  of what is  individual  and  empirical  it iSI  rather 
what must be conceived as realizing itself in what is  individual 
and empirical and as responsible both for the being and intellicid
gibility of the latter But what is  thus universal will  not necescid
sarilyalign together what are contiguous in space and  history 
and hence in  the Phenomenology  the  conceptual treatment  can 
jump wildly  from  one  factual  empirical  scene  to  the  other 
from for example the scientific universals behind phenomena 
to  the fellow  minds which discover  them in phenomena  from 
the antique Stoics and Sceptics who entrenched themselves in 
cogitative abstraction from contingent content to the medieval 
devotees who located their explanatory abstractions beyond all 
such  content from  the  compassion  which enables the  man  of 
conscience to forgive the sinsoiled man of action to the religious 
spirit which  can  see  the divine in all  men  and  so  on 

It is also necessary to stress here that the dialectical developcid
ment  which  Hegel  sees  as  connecting  his  phenomenological 
phases is  a  logical  growth  of notions  out of notions  given  to 
us  who consider the  cultural past  of humanity  as  resumed  in 
ourselves but not given as a logical growth to those who includcid
ing ourselves  went  through  the  actual  cases  of such  notions 
and not even exactly following  the order of the corresponding 
particularizations The mind of humanity in the  past did  not 
for  example see  the  necessary logical  step  from  the  kingdom 
of laws behind nature to the kingdom of subjects who consider 
nature  nor did  they in fact  historically  pass  from  the  one  to 
the other It is we  the phenomenological students of the shapes 
of Spirit who see  the logical  connections  between  them  and 
therefore  also  for  phenomenological  purposes  the  order  in 
which they must  be arranged  It is  important  therefore  that 
from tbe very beginning we frame viable conceptions of the logicid
cal  movements  our notional  shapes  of Spirit  must  undergo 
movements of which temporal sequences are often only inadecid
quatelyand  misplaced  reflections  See  for  example  Phenomcid
enology   I  p    Encyclopaedia    Subjectively  of 
course  as  we  have said all  these  movements involve  a  species 
of reflection  a  retreat  to  the  vantagepoint  of a  higherorder 
and  as  we  might now say  metalogical  examination  and  the 
consequent bringing into view of what can be  truly predicated

of a  thoughtphase  though not necessarily what is  meant or 
intended in its explicit content  But objectively  what are thus 
brought  into  view  are  other  thoughtphases  thoughtphases 
which in a very wide sense negate it or go beyond it and which 
involve  relations  as  various  to  the  thoughtphase  in  question 
as  being its necessary correlate or complement or opposite  or 
as  being what is  true of it though not  at all  part of its  content 
and perhaps contradicting the latter or as being a more explicit 
and perfect form  of what some  phase obscurely  prefigures  or 
as  being some inclusive whole or unity of which the  phase  in 
question can only be an excerpt The logical movement which 
the  Phenomenology  like  the  rest  of  the  system  exhibits  is 
throughout  the  logic  of the  side  or  aspect  or moment  of 
that which while it can be legitimately distinguished  in some 
unity  and  must  in  fact  be  so  distinguished  nevertheless 
represents something basically incapable of selfsufficiency and 
independence properties which can only  be attributed  to  the 
whole  into  which  sides  aspects  or  moments  enter  and  a 
reference  to  which  is  accordingly  built into  each such  side 
On Hegels  basic  assumptions  negation  in  a  wide sense  that 
covers difference opposition and reflection or relation is essencid
tial to conception and being we can conceive nothing and have 
nothing if we attempt to dispense with it  But negation  in  this 
wide sense always operates within a unity which is not as such 
divisible into selfsufficient  elements  but is  totally  present in 
each and all of its aspects  and we  conceive  nothing and  have 
nothing if we  attempt to dispense with  this  unity  This  unity 
in a sense negates  the former or primary negation  it changes 
what in a sense tried  to  be an independent element into a  mere 
aspect or moment This second sort of negation is not however 
comparable with  the first  it  involves  a  reversal  of direction 
which does not  however  annul the primary direction that it 
reverses The distinctions are still there  but only as  moments 
and  no longer as  independent elements 

It is  further  in retrospect  the unity which reverses the first 
negation  which  also  made  that  first  negation  possible  I t  is 
because a  unity indivisibly  underlies  distinct  sides  that  each 
such side can acquire a certain relative selfsufficiency and indecid
pendence  can after a  fashion  assert itself in opposition  to  the 
whole But it is  this  unity also which forces  the mind  and also

the thing  onward from one of its onesided aspects  to another 
aspect necessary to its completion and which ultimately builds 
all  sides into a  single  integrated  or  reasonable  totality  From 
the point of view of the phenomenological student we have here 
a  dialectical  process  or sequence  This  is  always  initiated  by 
the  Understanding  that  seemingly  marvellous  facuIty  see 
Phenomenology   PPo  that is able as it were to segre  
gate aspects in an indivisible whole and to endow the nonindecid
pendent with  a  certain quasiindependence  This  segregation 
is carried on by a dialectical phase in which other aspects then 
either negate  oppose  supplement  or  are  put into  necessary 
relation with the first  segregated aspect which then loses itself 
with  the  other  aspects  in  a  manysided  but  truly  indivisible 
whole From the point of view of the notional phases here concid
cerned they grow out of and into one another  not in the decid
rived  temporal sense in which the parts of an organism  grow 
out of one another  but rather in  the primary sense in which 
for  example the whole series  of numbers  grows  out of certain 
basic arithmetical principles The notional integration thus incid
dicated  ends  according to Hegel  in  Absolute  Knowledge  or 
the Absoluteldea the test of whose absoluteness consists simply 
in  the fact  that  nothing  further  remains  to  be  taken  care  of 
Even  the  contingencies  and  loosenesses  of  connection  that 
obtain in the world are such as  the sort of system we are concid
structing does and must involve  That Hegel does  achieve  this 
final integration is  of course  what many would dispute 

There is  however yet another sense in which the Phenomencid

ology  is  concerned only  with notions or concepts  ie  with  the 
universal shapes of Spirit and only indirectly with  the indivicid
dual instances  of such  shapes  This  depends  on  Hegels  view 
that conscious Spirit or subjectivity is itself exhaustively analyscid
able in terms of the three conceptual moments of universality 
specificity  and  singularity  and  that  it  represents  in  fact 
merely  an  extreme form  of these  three  notional  functions  a 
severance or an alienation of them from one another which is 
of course inseparable from their fruitful and necessary comingcid
together For Hegel does not believein the subject as being some 
detached substantival entity standing in  varying  relations  to 
other substantival entities which are its objects The subject is 
as said in  the  Encyclopaedia  the  active  or selfactive  universal

the universal in a peculiar form in which  it distinguishes  itself 
from what is specific and individual from what is perhaps given 
sensibly and yet goes forth  from itself and interprets and concid
trols what thus confronts it objectively In so doing moreover 
it  makes  its  objects  its  own  and is  thereby  enabled  to  return 
to self and  to  achieve  consciousness  of self  See  Phenomenology 
 I   p    also  Encyclopaedia  og  The  thinking  Ego  is 
further  in  another  place  Phenomenology    pp   
closely connected  and in fact identified  much  as  by  Kant in 
the Transcendental Deduction with the category or categories 
used in the synthetic constitution of objects by theunderstandcid
ing and at the end of the Phenomenology  the conceptualization 
of all objects and their subjection  to  universals  is  not seen  as 
different from the imposition on them of the form  af self Pheno 
menology    p    The subject  or  Ego is  thus  for  Hegel 
not what we ordinarily understand by a  personal thinker  but 
the  logical  function  of  universality  in  a  peculiar  sort  of 
detachment from its species and instances The mind for Hegel 
as for Aristotle  is  thus  the place of forms  a  bustling  Agora 
where such forms are involved in endless transactions and concid
versations and though it is by the intermediation of such forms 
that there is  a  reachingout to their individual instances  they 
none the less enjoy a relative independence there a detachment 
in  the  thoughtether  that  they  never  enjoy  elsewhere  Unicid
versals of course on Hegels view enjoya sunken implicit excid
istence in  natural objects see Encyclopaedia  and they also 
enjoy some sort of being beneath  the surface of natural objects 
as the essences or forces which expain them Phenomenology   
p  I   They are also  in the Logic given as having a  status 
as pure essentialities or as notional shadows without sensuous 
concretion in some  sense  prior to  the  existence of nature and 
finite spirit Hut however much universals  and thatUniversal 
of all Universals  the  Idea  may  exist  apart from  subjects  in 
any ordinary  sense  of the  latter  the  fact  remains  that  they 
achieve their full development and truth in the selfconscious
ness  of Spirit  in  which  all  universal  patterns  of logical  and 
natural  being are reactivated and  resumed 

The life then ofconsClous Spirit whether in the Phenomenology 
of Spirit or the later Philosophy of Spirit  is arguably only a  series 
of phases in which one or other of the moments of the  Notion 

xii 

FOREWORD 

is  detached  as  subjective  from  the  rest  which  are  thereby 
extruded  into  objectivity  and  which  are  then  again  reintecid
grated  with  the  moments  remaining  in  the  subject  again 
extruded  and  again  reintegrated  in  an  endlessly  developing 
rhythm Those who know Hegel well and are aware of the procid
found  connections  of the  Phenomenology  with  the  later  system 
which is in fact  all  there in the Jena writings  will know how 
mistaken are all those who think of the Phenomenology  as merely 
a contribution to existential phenomenology to which the later 
system is  largely irrelevant  From first  to  last  Hegel conceived 
everything in terms  of the selfactive  BegrifJ and  Idee  and  his 
thought is as remote from  the personally concerned  thought of 
the existentialists as  from  that of the grandiose suprapersonal 
Ego of Fichte These types of thought can of course be found 
encapsulated in Hegel  if one likes  to  look  for  them  since  he 
includes  what he  transcends  and  even  includes  what  he  will 
transcend once hisepigoni have formulated  it  Compare for 
example his dialectical anticipations of Mills views on induccid
tion and  of the logical  atomism of Wittgenstein and  Russell 
But what Hegel  brings  in  as  a  phase in an ongoing dialectic 
is  not  of course  his  last word on a  subject 

One more word  before we begin our introductory survey of 
the actual content of the PhenomenQlogySince the Phenomenology 
studies a  particular path from  immediate senseexperience  to 
aUgrasping  Wissenschqft  which  is  also  the  path  distilled  in 
Hegels experience from the previous experiences of the World 
Spirit  there  will  be much in that path that would  be illumicid
nated by knowledge of the personal history of Hegel we ought 
to know why he was impressed by certain notional entailments 
and affinities and not by others In part we do have considerable 
light on this topic  We understand for example  how  the love 
between  him and his sister  Christina caused him  to stress  the 
role of sisters in  ethicaJ  life  we  understand  his  interest in  the 
Antigonefrom his scool boy studies at Stuttgart and we under 
stand hisinterest in the French Enligbtenment and Revolution 
from the provincial posi tion of con tinentl Germany both hiscid
torical phases counted for much less in Britain There are also 
difficult allusions in his treatment of the  Unhappy Consciouscid

cannot always see why the route to Absolute Knowledge should 
wind through just these peculiar thickets  Hegel  was in fact  a 
writer of literary genius and one swayed in his choice of words 
by a  burgeoning unconscious  Once he departed from  the discid
piriting atmosphere of Berne and Frankfurt and ceased writing 
such relatively dull much overstudied writing as  he produced 
there  an  afflatus  seized  him  in  the  J ena  lecturerooms  an 
afflatus perhaps uniquein philosophical history which affected 
not only his ideas  but his style and which  makes  one at times 
only sure that he is saying something immeasurably profound 
and important but not exactly what it is  I am in this position 
despite help regarding thetwo intelligible worlds in the section 
on  Force  and  Understanding  To  comment  on  Hegel  funy 
would  therefore  req uire  the  same  sort  of psychological  and 
metapsychological treatment that has  long  been  practised  on 
an essentially rapt man like  Shakespeare or  on  such  a  Galic 
genius as  Rimbaud or Mallarme Despite the sensitive work of 
Jean Hyppolite we  are far from having anything like  a  really 
full  commentary on  the  Phenomenology  The  general  remarks 
that  I  shall  now  make  will  therefore  yield  only  a  very  incid
adequate  prefatory illumination 

We shall begin  our treatment of the Phenomenology  with the 
In tloductiol ignoring thebea u tifulandfamous Preface which 
was in fact only added when the book was complete and which 
was  meant  to  introduce  not  only  the  Phenomenology  but  the 
whole system  The point of the  Introduction is  simply to give 
apreliminary conception justified only when the wbrk would 
be  complete as  to how  a  study of the shapes  of mind  leading 
one on from immediate experience to what claimed to be sciencid
tific knowledge could succeed in dissipating doubt as to the real 
possibility of the whole venture Might not the finally corrected 
sbape  which  emerged  from  such a  process be as  remote from 
things as they in themselves are as  the first  uncorrected  imcid
mediate  shape  And  how  could  the  projected  work  abolish 
Kants  view  that  an examination  of human  knowledge  only 
shows  not  that such knowledge  can really reach some  stand  
pointwhere theAbsolute ortheThingin Itself will he accessible 
to it but that this is for ever and in itself impossible  that there 
are and must be  aspects of things that we  can indeed conceive 
negatively or perhaps have beliefs about but of Yhich  we can

FOREWORD 

never  have  knowledge  Hegels  criticism of this  critical  view 
ofknowledge is simply that it is selfrefuting that it pronounces 
even if negatively on the relation of conscious  appearances  to 
absolute reality  while  claiming  that  the  latter must for  ever 
transcend knowledge  To this selfrefuting view Hegel opposes 
the view that the distinction between what things in themselves 
are  and what things only are for  consciousness  or knowledge 
must itselfbe a distinction drawn within consciousness that the 
former can be only the  corrected  view of an object  while  the 
latter is merely a view formerly entertained but now abandoned 
as incorrect The progress of knowledge will  then consist in the 
constant demotion of what appeared  to  be  the absolute  truth 
about the object to  what now appears to  be only the way  that 
the object appeared to consciousness a new appearance of absocid
lute  truth  taking the formers  place 

Hegel however assumes that this  progress must have a  final 
term a state where knowledge need no longer transcend or corcid
rect itself where it will discover itselfin its object and its object 
in itself where concept will correspond to  object and object to 
consciousness  see   p    Such a conception might seem 
to go too far for surely an endless inadequacy of knowledge to its 
object woqld otdestroy aU meaning and validity in such knowcid
ledge nor would this vanish were there tobe aspects of things of 
which as Kant held we could only frame negative regulative 
conceptions  but of which we could never have definite  knowcid
ledge Hegel will however marvellousl y include in his final no tion 
ofthefinalstate of knowledge the notion of an endless progress 
that can have  no  final  term  For he  conceives  that  precisely 
in seeing the object as  an endless problem  we  forthwith  see  it 
as  not  being a  problem at alL  For what  the object in itself is 
is simply to be the other the stimulant of knowledge and prac 
dee which in being for  ever capable of being temouldeq and 
reinterpreted is also everlastingly pinned down and found  out 
beingjust what it is The implication ofal  this is that the teleocid
logical view of objectivity as  being intrinsically destined  to  be 
interpreted and con trolled by consciousness will prove on a sufcid
ficiently  deep  examination  to  be  so  wholly  appeasing  and 
satisfying  that  no shadow  of the  hidden  or  inexplicable  will 
remain to haunt us  We shall then bein a fit state to investigate 
the essentialities of being as set forth in the Logic and  the sub

sequent selfexternalization of these essentialities in the  philoscid
ophies of Nature and Spirit Whether this Hegelian view of the 
role of the  object  as  a  mere inspirer of spiritual effort is  valid 
may of course be questioned  there would certainly seem to  be 
obscurities  inconsequences  and  dysteleologies  in  our  world 
which demoralize  rather than stimulate  spiritual effort  We 
shall  not  however  consider  these  contemporary depressants 
which  Hegel  as  a  German  Romantic  could  not  have  en  
visaged 

The Introduction in its fina paragraphs g  pp    

makes  the further  important  point  that  the  lessons  that  concid
sciousness learns in its continued experience of objects are not 
for  it a continuous course of lessons  it conceivesthat it is  concid
stantly passing to  some  new and  unrelated  object  when it is 
really only seeing its previous object in some novel critical light 
It is  not for example aware as  previously said  that the  concid
sciousness of an order of mutually conscious persons is what was 
implicit in the awareness of laws forces and other essentialities 
hehind the phenomena of nature it is  we  the phenomenologicid
cal students who see  the deep notional continuity in what  is 
for it a kaleidoscope of objects It is important in what follows 
that we should always  distinguish  between  the  actual  transicid
tioDS  occurring in conscious experience and  the logical  transicid
tions  that the phenomenologist elicits from  these  latter 

In Section A on Consciousness Hegel explores three relations

as  This  Here  Now  I  etc  which  are  all  irremediably 
general in meaning Perception ikewise is dialectically flawed 
by its incapacity to integrate the separate characters it picks out 
with  the  unified  individuality  of the  object  to  which  it seeks 
to attribute  them  Both  lead  on  to  Understanding  where  the 
universal in terms of which immediacies are  to  be  understood 
is  both a complex pattern unifying a  number of discriminable 
characters and aso involves the distinction of the manifest and 
the  dispositional  the  latter  being  part  and  parcel  of such 
notions as  permanent  nature  specific  essence  force  and  law 
But the realm of the essential  and dispositional  is  dialectically 
flawed by its inability to explain the comprehensive dovetailing 
of essential natures forces  and laws into one another so  as  to 
form only one system ofinteracting essentialities It is by recogcid
nizing something akin  to  the  explanatory  unity  imparted  by 
conscious mind to all that it considers that this dialectical flaw 
is  removed  and  that  the  consciousness  of objects  is  replaced 
by selfconsciousness or by a consciousness  of consciousness  It 
isimportant to realize that the sensing perceiving understand  
ing and self  conscious mind does  not perceive the logical concid
nections  which  lead  from  each  of these  stages  to  the next  It 
is we the phenomenologists who perceive them To consciouscid
ness itself there is simply a blurred sensuous confrontation with 
unseizable qualified  particulars which  becomes clarified into 
a perception of things which in some manner mysteriously unite 
different  aspects  or  characters  and  which  then  becomes 
organized  in  the  sense  of a  number of  regularly  recurrent 
naturesmaking  dynamic  impacts  upon  us  and  upon  oQe 
another  From  this  the glance simply switches  to  the  rational 
creatures  around  oneself  who  are  all  interpreting  the  same 
objects  without identifying  their  interpretative  acts  with  the 
interpretations embedded in things  It is  the  watching  phenocid
menologist who discerns  aU  these  transitions  and  who  above 
all  performs  the difficult  nonformal  transition  from  Things 
are in teracting in  a  manner  X  to  We all  are  understanding 
things  as  interacting in a  manner X 

From Consciousness A  we have therefore jumped to B  Selfcid
consciousness where our object is  now a conscious  Ego an accid

intellectually and to master practically    p   Practical 
desire  which  transforms  the  object  is  at  this  stage  more  im 
portant  than  intellectual  interpretation  But  the  active  unicid
versality  of the  subject  Ego  is  at  first  unwilling  to  see  in  the 
active Universality of the  object Ego  a just reflection  of itself 
I t at first tries to demote the object Ego to one that will indeed 
recognize itas subject Ego but whom it in its  turn will not fully 
recognize as  an  active subject  S  p    This demotion 
of object Egos  by subject  Egos  then  inevitably  leads  to  what 
Hegel  calls  a  Lifeanddeath struggle  each  subject  wishes  to 
be the sole centre of active universality and  to risk all in assertcid
ing  his  claims  Sucha policy  however  threatens  to  deprive 
each  subject  of the  recognition  he  demands  and  hence  the 
struggle develops into one for  a  sovereign  position  among accid
tively universal subjects all others  being  wholly subordinated 
to this one Lord and Bondsman  But this onesided aspiration 
is  also  selffrustrating  since  the recognition  one receives  from 
a  palerefiex of oneself can be  no  true recognition  and will  in 
fact  impoverish  the  receiver whereas  the  recognition  the  serf 
accords  tohis  lord  and the work  he  does  for  him  will  raise 
him to a far higher consciousness of active universality than the 
lord  can  ever  enjoy  Ohviously  the  flawed  imperfect  unicid
versality where every subject desires sovereignty only for himself 
the second occurrence of the variable not beingindeBendently 
quantified  necessarily  corrects  itself  in  the  unfiawed  unicid
versality  where  every  subject  recognizes  and  promotes  active 
universality in  every  subject  where all  men  equally  recognize 
and cooperate  with one another 

This stage must however at first be present as an inner ideal 
to  which  the  particularity  of interpersonal  existence  will  not 
as yet conform the world is  not as yet so  arranged  that aU  can 
he servants and  thus also lords to one another  The selfactive 
universal therefore withdraws stoically into the emptily abstract 
fortress of reason and virtue or recognizing this emptiness into 
a similar impractically sceptical fortress which commits itself to 
nothing whatever whether theoretical or practical Finally we 
have an extreme pathologicalform of spiritual withdrawal in 
which consciousness  unable to disengage itself from irrational 
particularity simply identifies itseIfwith the latter and is  then 
led to extrude the rational universality which is its true selfinto

pathology makes itself the universal serf  whie  the lord  in his 
perfection becomes noone and dwells nowhere Such a strained 
separation of moments that necessarily belong together cannot 
but breakdown Consciousness must pass from a wallowing selfcid
abasing mysticism to a reasonahleframe of mind It must see  the 
world in all its natural and social arrangements as  something 
to be known  enjoyed  and improved  by all  since  it embodies 
the same universality that is active in each subject  Here again 
we must stress that the logical sequence of phases from the Lifecid
anddeathstruggle to Reason is not a gical sequence for those 
who live through it They pass from Hobbesian egoism  to varicid
ous forms of abstract intersubjectivity  then to a despair which 
locates  all  shared  universality  infinitely  above  and  beyond 
themselves  and  then on  to  a  confidence  born  from  the sheer 
absurdity of such despair all  without seeing  the secret logical 
links  which  link  one such attitude to  another 

The next section  of the Phenomenology     devoted 
to  various forms  of Vernunjt  or  Reasonableness  gets  off  after 
a short discussion of the Hegelian meaning of idealism 
  pp  IHas a  philosophy  which  discovers  the same 
universality in  the world  as  in  subjective  thought to a  concid
sideration of various forms of scientific empiricism and expericid
mentation This is not the same as the projections of the Undercid
standing studied in I  pp   since  the scientific 
understanding  is  now  conscious  and  confident  even  if 
obscurely of its own methodologicalprocedures We start with 
the observational study of nature in which the universal in the 
mind divines  its  own presence in  the  worJd  and is  guided  by 
an  instinct of reason  to see  what that presence  may in detail 
involve  Hegel goes  lnto a  long discussion  of various  forms  of 
observational description  and  classification  and  the  passage 
from these to the formulation of laws which involve unmanifest 
and dispositionaLfactors The discovery of such laws is  wholly 
successfu in the inorganic realm but can only be partially sue  
cessful in the organic realm where all laws are laws of tendency 
and involve contingencies introduced by that universal indivicid
dual  the  Earth as  well  as  al  the systematic  indefinitenesses 
of teleology  The observational urge  therefore directs  itself incid

vestigates first the principles of a logic conceived in purely psycid
chologistic terms and then the wider psychologism which deals 
in  contingent  mental  traits  and  faculties  This  treatment  of 
conscious  inwardness  as  if  it  had  the  contingency  and  the 
singularity of external  natural  being  leads  however  inevitcid
ably to attempts to physicalize consciousness to identify it with 
a thing or a set of things  that we find  out there in the natural 
world Had Hegel lived in the present age we should now have 
had a long treatment of the behaviourisms of Watson and Tolcid
man and Skinner  as it is  we are treated to  a  repulsively long 
discussion  of the  crude physiognomic speculations  of Lavater 
and  the phrenological fantasies  of Gall  All  that  is  important 
in Hegels long attempt to make dialectical sense of these primicid
tive exercises is the final outcome that if selfconsciousness can 
be reduced to something like a bone or a  bonestructure  then 
a  hone or a  bonstructure must  be  credited  with  aU  the  incid
tentional  negativity  and  the  negation  of this  negativity  incid
volved  in selfconsciousness  The manreuvres  of reductionism 
are accordingly vain if mind can be modelled  by matter matcid
termust be possessed of every intricate modality of mind Nothcid
ing has been achieved by the reduction and since the phenocid
mena of self co nsciousness are richer and more intrinsically incid
telligible than the limi ted repertoire that we ordinarily ascribe 
to matter it is matter rather than mind that is thereby reduced 
This conclusion is whatBertrand Russell would call malicious 
Hegel however is  not ashamed of the vengeful ingratitude of 
consciousness and spirit it overreaches its pitiable other  and 
reduces  it  to itself 

Hegel  now  characteristically  moves  from  a  reasonableness 
concerned  to discover  itself in objects  to  a  reasonableness  con  
cerned to impose  itself on objects  through  overt action  After a 
few  initial  moves    pp    which  anticipate 
what will really only emerge at the stage of the Spiritual Hegel 
begins by discussing  the hedonistic approach to the world the 
reasonableness which makes everything in the world including 
the body and soul of another person minister to ones own satiscid
faction  This attitude breaks down in a  manner anagous  to 
theseemingfulness of sensecertainty  it condemns the hedonist 
to an endless hollow search for new pleasures which never procid
vide a lasting content for selfconsciousness The hedonistic life

FOREWORD 

therefore dissolves into the romantic life  of the  heart  the  life 
which  espouses  grand  projects  which  in  their  extravagance 
measure up  to  the sweeping  universality of selfconsciousness 
but which inevitably clash with the equally grand lifeprojects 
of others The game of the heart then yields place to the greater 
game ofvirtue of the keeping of oneself pure in quixotic scruple 
and  total indifference  to  the  way  of the  world  This  game 
however also interferes with  the parallel quixotism  of others 
and with the sensible nonquixotism of the ordered social world 
which is  more truly universal than the cult of personal  virtue 
The dialectic  then swings  over from  arbitrary  subjectivity  to 
the arbitrary objectivity of Sachlichkeit A man identifies himself 
with a  Sache  a  thing  or a  task  which  is  his  own  and  which 
he  pursues  without regard  to  external  success  or  approval 
Everyone else  is  similarly supposed  to  be  devoting  himself to 
his own Sache  Such disinterested fulfilment of tasks rests  howcid
ever on selfdeception  Its disinterestedness is  always  held  up 
for  the admiration of others  and is  really  a  form  of personal 
exhibitionism When this is exposed disinterestedness shifts  to 
a  moralistic form  setting up  absolute prescriptions of various 
simple sorts Tell the truth Help others etc These can howcid
ever  never achieve  the  complete  exceptionlessness  to  which 
they aspire  Reasonableness  then finally  assumes  the Kantian 
form ofidentifying the universal with the formally universalizcid
able or selfconsistent This Hegel shows  is  as  vacuous as  the 
universalism of the Stoics or Sceptics since any way ofHfe can 
be rendered formally  selfconsistent  We  therefore  move  to  a 
universalism which is substantial as  well  as  subjective  the  unicid
versalism of the ethical life of an actual communi ty whose laws 
and customs clothe the bare bones of ethical prescriptions with 
living flesh and make the universalizing life genuinely possible 
We pass from  the  merely Reasonable  t Vernunft  to  the  higher 
stage of the  Spiritual  t Geist  

Hegel finds  the exemplary material for his first  rudimentary 
form of spirituality in the ethical world of Greek tragedy with 
which he had come into vivid contact in his Gymnasium studies 
at Stuttgart Rudimentary spiritual life is  not the life of an un  
divided  community  with  which  the  individual  subject  iden

tions  dimly backed  by dead  ancestors  as  in  the  overt  power 
of the  State  with  its  openly proclaimed  daylight  laws  The 
law  of the  family  is  a  divine  law  a  law  stemming  from  the 
underword of the unconscious and interpreted by the intuitive 
females in the family  the state law is  on  the contrary human 
and is proclaimed and enforced by mature males Hegel makes 
plain  that  these  two  laws  must  at  times  clashthe  theme  of 
the  Antigone  and  other  tragedies  in  the  case  of such  clashes 
the  individual  incurs  guilt  whatever  he  may  do  Obviously 
Hegel has  here  seized  on  a  very profound  source  of disuni ty 
in ethical spiritual life  the clash between a  selftranscendence 
which is deep but also tinged with contingent immediacy and 
a  selftranscendence  which  can  be  extended  indefinitely 
but 
lacks  depth 
The truly moral life  to  which we  must advance will be as  deep 
in  its  care  for  individual  problems  and  circumstances  as 
it is wide in its  concern for anyone and everyone For the  time 
being however  the rent life  of the primitive ethical communcid
ity  must  yield  place  to  a  spiri tual  life  where  all  in timacy  is 
dissolved 

that  very  extensibility  necessarily 

in 

Hegel here chooses for his illustration the atomistic life of Imcid

perial Rome     pp   where every man counts 
as  no more  thana propertyowner and  the state  laws  merely 
concern the ownership and transmission  of property  Such an 
atomistic comlDunity to which all individual needs and characcid
ters are indifferent necessarilyculminatesin a moreorless arbicid
trarily selected Imperator or Worldmaster  whose  relation to 
the  community  is  external  and  quite  void  of anything  like 
family depth and warmth The removal of intimacy of warmth 
or  soul  from  the  mutual  recognition  of  the  communitys 
members must  however necessarily give rise to a sense of dis 
tance of estrangement or alienation from the community The 
latter may represent the individuals  true  self  but he  cannot 
find  himself in it  If Hegel  has  chosen  Imperial  Rome  as  his 
first example of such alienation he now leaps to seventeenthcid
and  eighteenthcentury continental  Europe  with its dazzling 
French  centre  for  one  of his  most  fascinating  and  brilliant 
phenomenological  studies  The  jup here  taken  shows  how 
little  the  Phenomenology  is  an  eidetic  reconstitution  of history 
and  how  much it is  concerned with spiritual stances  that  are

very widely scattered for example in Hellenistic Greece  India 
in the  time of Buddha  contemporary America  etc 

In the immense centralsection of Spirit  pp 
 in which Hegel discusses alienated spirituality there are 
two  central focuses  the  focus  of Enlightenment  Aujklarung  
representing the abstract communal life ofa mutual recognition 
and shared use of facilities which never becomes intimate and 
the focus  of Faith or Belief Glaube  which in a  dim and con 
fused  way strives  to  overcome  the  abstraction  which  leads  to 
alienation and to return to  the intimate concreteness of tribal 
and family life It seems clear that in this section Hegel is really 
characterizing the spiritual life of Germany that eternal servi 
tor among nations condemned to admire and imitate the brilli 
ant brittle universalism of French life and culture while always 
hankering  after  the  integrity  and  concreteness  of a  simpler 
sturdier  more peasantlike vision  the vision which expressed 
itself for example in the Rhineland masters or in countless relicid
gious sculptors and woodcarvers The German eighteenth cencid
tury  was  one  of the highpoints of such  alienation  if it was 
the age when Voltaire and  Maupertuis plumed  themselves  at 
Fredericks court it was also  the age of the pietists so  strong 
aninfluence in the early life of Kant and Hegel the simple good 
people  who  scorned  all  but  the  precepts  and  transforming 
example of the Holy One of the Gospels  The simple  man of 
virtue and good sense  whom Hegel depicts as struck dumb by 
the ruthless wit of the French salons  S  pp   is 
argua bly the eternal German visi tor struggling to unify the cuI 
tivated negations ofa disintegrating society which he admires 
but only half unders tands with the simple standards and princid
ciples that the  folks at home still  rely on  and  live  by 

The spiri tuali ty of the Enlightenmen t is firs tsketched in a seccid
tion entitled Enlightenment and its Realm of Actuality 
 pp    This spirituality is  characterized  as  being 
essentially one of Culture  Bildung  by which  nothing immecid
diateor natural is  reckoned  as of importance  I ts  universality 
isthatofthe open variable one must always be ready to progress 
further  to  develop  talents  and  possibilities  to  replace  ones 
initial  constants  with  others  This  open  variaJility  reveals 
itself  on  the  one  hand  in  the  infinitely  ramifying  structure 
of the state bureaucracy ulminanthe ME  n

the other hand in the endless open variability of economic life 
in which enterprises always expand or decline  fortunes  go  up 
and  down  and  extreme  wealth  always  goes  flanked  by  abcid
ject  penury  This  spirituality  is  also  always  one  of divided 
values residues of feudal loyalty still attach to the bureaucracy 
and  the  monarch  while  new  vaues  whether  favourable  or 
unfavourable  circulate  about  moneymaking  and  moneycid
changers  In  the inner life  of those  who  live  in  this  alienated 
regime the divided values appear in two new forms in sophisticid
cated  Voltairian  insight  on  the  one  hand  and  in  the  decid
liberate unsophistication of pious  belief Glaube  on the other 
These  are  discussed  through   I  pP   I  and 
Hegel is mainly concerned to stress that the whole fight between 
these seemingly irreconcilable opponents is  really a sham fight 
since  the generalized  insights  of Voltairianism  mean  nothing 
without their  concrete  implementation  in  such  lives  as  those 
of good Godfearing people just as the simple faith of the lat 
ter is  really in its indifference to  anything merely outward  or 
literal as full of critical negativity as the enlightenment of Volcid
taire  The Voltairian thinks  religious  piety is  intent  on  icons 
or wafers  or historical events which never happened whereas 
religious piety is  as  critical of vain observances or of external 
signs as the Voltairian and believes only in religious events that 
can be reenacted in the believers heart And if the Voltairian 
regards  the God  of pious  worship  as  a  mere  projection  of its 
thought the pietist agrees with him in worshipping a God felt 
not to  be  alien  to  his  own  spirituality  but  as  being  the  unicid
versality  of which  he  represents  only  the  contraction  S 
pp   The various abstractions posited by the enlightcid
ened whether going by the names of matter or the supreme 
being are likewise mere prQjections of the enlightened persons 
thought only more empty and the same in their total emptiness 
The alienated spirituality of the Enlightenment is  not howcid

ever able to achieve a true synthesis of abstractly universalistic 
insight and pious unsophistication  its  most  positive  achieve 
ment in this direction is  the thin  notion of Nutzlichkeit  Utility 
 S   pp   I I  I     Everything in the world has  then  its sole 
justification in its  usefulness  towards  human ends  which like 
anything merely concrete generate an endless series ofperformcid
ances  and  arrangements  each exciting purely  for  the  sake  of

something else  But the  two  abstractions of individual subjeccid
tivity  on  the one  hand  with its  intimately felt  demands  and 
the  indifferent  external  bureaucraticeconomic machine  on 
the other have necessarily to come together  and this is  at first 
brought about in an abstraction which  liquidates  both  much 
as  emptily restless Becoming in the Logic is  the joint outcome 
of emptily  abstract  Being  and  emptily  abstract  Nothingness 
The pure selfassertion  of the  individual  person  the  element 
alwa ys passed over by the whole aliena ted society storms the Bascid
tille and creates a society which will reflect and express his absocid
lute self alone It does not however take Hegel long to exhibit 
the purely destructive and ultimately selfdestructive profile of 
this  spiritual  stance    Spiritual  sansculottism  can 
have no programme but the downing and doingaway of everycid
thing  and  everyone  it  can  generate  no  principle  of selfdifcid
ferentiation it can throw up no genuine or permanent leadercid
ship  It is  a  government  by junta by cahal  and  intrigue  and 
can achieve only  the universal  suppression and  liquidation of 
individuality It would have been interesting if  instead of this 
dialectical criticism of the  relatively innocuous  and  transient 
synthesis  of Liberty  Equality  and  Fraternity  dismembered 
almost as soon as formed  we had had Hegels criticisms of the 
far more adhesive pitchlike abstractions oftheCommunslMani
jeslo  in which  the feet  of humanity would  seem  as  if for  ever 
entangled 

The third of Hegels studies  of Spirituality is  entitled  Spirit 
Sure of ItselforMorality  S  I  pp    Here we 
have  a  study  of dutiful  subjectivity  by  which  Hegel  undercid
stands neither the personal  cult of Virtue  a  superseded  form 
of egoistic Reasonableness nor the blind obedience to the daycid
light or underground laws of the substantial ethical community 
but  rather a  set of practically  oriented  attitudes  representing 
the individuals own deep reflection  on  conduct  balanced  by 
a deep respect for  the parallel reflections of other The moral 
view of the  world  sees  the  fulfilment  of duty  not  only  as  the 
whole  task of man  but  also  as  the  whole  purpose  of nature 
and also ofa continuation of life and consciousness beyond the 
limits of our present state Such a  view  requires supplementacid
tion  by  theological postulates  we  must posit  a  God  who  will 
guarantee the indefinite survival that will  make endless  moral

progress possible  and who  will  also  complete  the  moral good 
of virtue  with  the  natural  good  of happiness  Such  a  view  is 
at once involved in peculiar contradictions and in the bad faith 
and  hypocrisy  Verstellung  used  to  cover  up  such  contradic  
tions  It must alternate like Sisyphus  between seeming on  the 
point  of pushing  the  stone  of its  sensuousness  on  to  the  high 
plateau of perfect virtue and then realizing that this would decid
stroy  rather  than  perfect  virtue  and  so  sinking  back  once 
more to the bottom of the hill See for example  p  
These  selfcontradictory  postulations  and  these  hypocritical 
selfdeceptions are then all cured in the spiritual stance of pure 
Conscientiousness where the subject makes his goal the simple 
doing of his duty as he sees it without worrying about its relations 
to the natural or supernatural order or without raising the uncid
real issue of what he should do once he has achieved perfection 
Conscientiousness  so  defined  has  its  standard  of certainty  in 
itself it is undisturbed by the conflict ofprma facieduties since 
it is  the sole  arbiter as  to which  must override which    p 
   t is  also  undis turbed by  the  conflict  between different 
mens consciences since it is  not part of the idea of conscience 
thatitshould pronounce identically to different men  The cult 
of conscience is  a  religion  a  religion  at once  lonely  yet  at  a 
higher level communaL  My conscience in its  absolute  majesty 
legislates for  me  and  for  me  alone  but its  legislation for  me  is 
recognized  as  valid  by  all  conscientious  persons  and  so  in  a 
sense  becomes  a  law for  all  S  pp   

 

Hegels analysis is  here  very  profound  and  wholly  true  to 
what we actually think and say It is superior to analyses which 
argue that where consciences differ  one or other must be misa 
taken failing  to see  that they  thereby remove  the one solvent 
virtue of conscientiousness  that it can decide issues  which are 
in the abstract undecidable This solvent virtue ofconscientiouscid
ness  is  however open to other difficulties  though inerrant in 
what it proclaims it can at times be thought to be enunciating 
duties  when it is  not  really pronouncing dearly on  anything 
or when its presumed voice is really that of some external authcid
ority or ofsome private interest or some intellectual confusion 
And  while  the  communion  of  conscientious  persons  must 
always respect my conscience they may at times doubt whether 
some  pronouncement  really  springs  from  my  conscience

FOREWORD 

whether it is  not the expression  of some  hypocritical  personal 
interest  I  pp    Faced  with  this  new  fear  of selfcid
deceit conscience readily takes refuge in a passive concern with 
problems it prefers to wring its hands in beautiful impotence 
rather than do something  that  may  be  wrong  and  so  violate 
the law  of conscience    p    This  impotent  beauty 
of soul  then  confronts  the  other  species  of conscientiousness 
which has dared to make difficult decisions  and  perhaps goes 
on  to  condemn  it  thereby  however  implicitly  condemning 
itself  For the refusal  to take a  decision is  itself a  decision even 
if of higher order  The  confrontation  may  however  lead  on 
to a higher spiritual reconciliation that of mutual understandcid
ing and forgiveness among men who have nevertheless decided 
differently At this stage Hegel tells us  morality becomes relicid
gious we experience a spirit at once present in  yet transcendcid
ing thedifference of conscientious agents and which is  rightly 
thought of as suprapersonal and divine  I  pp    If 
the quarrelof consciences really ended there would be no place 
for God  God exists and is  active  because He lives  beyond any 
form  of reasoned  consensus 

Hegels  phenomenology of Religion    pp  
 runs through all the forms in which men have conceived 
and must necessarily conceive  a  spirituality which  transcends 
their own and which as much lies behind nature as  behind  the 
personal  and  social  life  of men  He  writes  beautifully  of the 
Iraniln religion of Light of theIndian pantheisms which place 
the malign and sinister alongside the beautiful and good of the 
Egyptian  religion  of the  Understanding  with  its  passion  for 
geometrical forms  and for  enigmatic sculptural  combinations 
of human  rationality with  animality  From  all  these  we  pass 
on to  the ArtReligion of Greece which if tinged in Hegels 
account  with  eighteenthcentury  German  sensibility  and 
romanticism  is  still  described  with  aptness  and  beauty  The 
sculptured god represents to Hegd a fine fusion of rational selfcid
consciousness with sensuous  externality  and  the same applies 
to the hymn and the rite to the athlete w th his glorious public 
body  and  to  the  semireligious  performances  of tragedy and 
comedy All forms  of religion which unite the selfconsciously 
human with what  transcends  it  must  however  suffer decay

at  such  a  point  in  time  that  Christianity  the  absolute  and 
revealed  religion first  made its  appearance  a  religious stance 
in  which  human  spirituality  strives  upwards  towards  and 
becomes one with a  spirituality which  transcends the  human 
while the latter likewise is seen as coming down into and transcid
figuring  human  spirituality  If this  spiritual  identification  of 
two natures was  conceived  of as  first  occurring in  the historic 
person of Jesus it was also thought of as being capable of being 
shared  by  a  whole  society  of believers  to  whom  the  Divine 
Spirit at work in Jesus  could  be further  communicated  Such 
a  union of the individual  and  the  specific  with  the  transcencid
dently universal is of course for  Hegel  the  sense  and  truth of 
everything It is not necessary nor pertinent for us here to enter 
into  a  long  assessment  of  Hegels  merits  or  demerits  as  a 
Christian theologian  Plainly he saw as merely pictorial  much 
thatorthodox Christians would see  as  essential  to  their faith 
But his  philosophical  reconstitution  of Christianity strays  ne 
further from  his  original  than for  example  the  Aristoteliancid
neoPlatonic  reconstitution  of Aquinas  in  Some  respects  it 
keeps closer to it For the Christianity of German y as witnessed 
by countless infinitely affecting altarpieces  has  always  been 
one that could best distil beauty from  agony and which could 
see  what was  most  divine in the lifting of the  ordinary griefs 
frustrations and pathetic needs of men into a region that transcid
cends the human The Christian God is essentially redemptive 
and Hegels philosophy is  essentially  a  philosophy of redempcid
tion ofa selfalienation that returns to self in victory  If Hegel 
was nothing better he was at least a great Christian theologian 
The phenomenological drama now draws to its  close  Con 

sdousness  has  confronted  the  world  through  the  senses  decid
scribed it perceptually and construed it quasiscientifically  It 
has learnt after some initial distortions to put itself on a  level 
with others  and  has  proceeded  with their aid  to  classify  and 
explain  the  phenomena of nature and  mind  It has  also  tried 
to contribute distinctively to interpersonal life  by various percid
sonal  programmes  of  a  hedonistic  sentimental  improving 
absorbedly  practical  and  analytically  ethical  sort  It  has 
become aware of the community of conscious persons as  united

and  also  dirempted  by  the  close  bonds  of common  ancestry 
and family love and also more loosely but widely held together 
by governmental and economic ties  I t has experienced the ten 
sions  of social  positions  where  men  are  subjected  to  external 
legal and economic pressures where their need for a  more pro 
found  comm union  has  to  be  displaced  to  the  higher  plane of 
faith  It has worked  through the various stages and syndromes 
of a  conscientiousness  that has  learnt to  cut Gordian knots in 
its practical decisions and to respect others whose decisions have 
cut  these  differently  It has  risen  to  a  reHgion  for  which  the 
active  universality  the  Spirit  which  informs  the  teleology  of 
nature  and  history  is  also  felt  and  pictured  as  a  principle 
which achieves selfconsciousness in a  paradigmatic man and 
through  the  Spirit  there  present  in  all  men  What will  now 
be  achieved  is  das  absolute  Wisstn  the  perfect  knowledge  only 
consummated in philosophy and here spoken of with a  brevity 
and a  modesty which accords  with Hegels simple sense of its 
allirnportance For absolute  knowledge is  simply the realizacid
tion that all forms  of objectivity are identical with those essencid
tial to the thinking suQjectso that in construing the world concid
ceptludly it is seeing everything in theform of self the selfheing 
simply the ever  active  principle of conceptual universality of 
categrial synthesis In itsconceptua grasp ofobjects it necescid
sarily grasps what ititsdfis and ingfasping itself it necessarily 
grasps every phase of objectivity These are the claims obscurely 
stated in  Kants transcendental deduction  hut  there  given  a 
onesidedly subjective slant which is  here for  ever done away 
with  See Roo  pp   

 

Prior to this final conceptual grasp  there has heen a long procid

cess  in  time  during  which  the  extruded  concept  the  self 
alinated from self has been steadily enriched in its determinacid
tions until when the process was completed the extruded concid
cept simply came into coincidence with  the self which  studies 
it  and  Time in which the process  was  completing itself  was 
abolished made wholly irrelevant I  pp   The be 
ginnings  of absolute  knowledge  occurred  at  a  point  in  time 
when the religious vie of the Midde Ages yielded  to the first 
stirring of modern postRenaissance  thought  when Descartes

to a single substance and through Leibnizs further diremption 
of this substance into countless points of individual spirituality 
Then follqwed  the  Enlightenment  with  its  stress  on  utilitycid
the  unmentioned  empiricists  are  not  here  seen  as  helping  on 
conceptual graspand thisin its turn gave rise to the Kantian 
subordination  of all  practicaJ  ends  to  the  demands  of  the 
rational willthe transcendental deduction here also goes  uncid
mentionedand  this  to  the  philosophy  of Fichte  where  the 
pure  self necessarily  opposes  itself to  yet  also  identifies  itself 
with the flux of time and is  further opposed to the frozen difcid
ferentiation  of space  From  this  the  thought  of Schelling  de  
veloped where substantial being and subjective  thought were 
alike  thrown back into  the abyss  of the Absolute  and  neither 
enjoyed  an  unquestioned  priority  Out  of all  these  thoughtcid
stances the final  form of conceptual grasp emerged where  the 
selfor subject sawitsefas itself the Absolute externalizingitself 
in  substantial  objective  naturej  yet  conscious  of itself in  this 
very act of sefexternalization and  of itself  in fact  as  simply 
hingits own actofelfidentificationin and through such extercid
nalization  The packed thought of  pp    defiescid
reproduction in term other than its own and one is quite uncid
SlJre  that one  bas got the full  gist  of it  At this  stage of grasp 
the  whole  distinctioobetween  objective  truth  and  subjective 
certitude vanishes the Notion or Concept unites  both aspects 
in itself Weare thereforein a  position to develop the scientific 
ystem which has  been our goal from  the first  where  notions 
develop  purely  out  of notions  in  virtue  of  their  own  inner 
oppositions and mediations  Obviously what Hegel is  here ancid
ticipating    p  is  the  Logic  or Metaphysics  which 
is  the first  part of his system  He tells  us  that this  system  must 
then go onto exhibit theselfexternalization ofhispurey logical 
categories  in  the  sensuous  shows  of nature  and  in  the  concid
tingencies which fill space and time  p    and that 
ilmust then study itselfreturning tnitsef out of natures extercid
nality a  return which willrestate the  content of the  phenomcid
enology in the form of a real history of spirit ie  in the Philoscid
ophy of Spirit which will form the third partof the system Bo 
pp  c  What has further happened  at  this  point is  that 
the phenomenological We that has been examining and ordercid
ing  the  shapes  of consciousness  has  itself become  one  of their

number has revealed itselfas being the final shape of consciouscid
ness  As  such  it  now  appropriates  and  remembers  the  whole 
content of the development that it has been studying and can 
go on to study alignments of shapes which are as  much shapes 
of being as  of its  own  conscious  eerti tude 

We  might at this  point go  on to  analyse  the superb  Vorrede 
or Preface which Hegel wrote early in   as an Introduction 
not only to the Phenomenology but to the whole system We shall 
however  abstain from  doing  this  and  shall  leave  the  reader 
with a  task which he should be able to perform with  pleasure 
provided he reads the rest of the book before the Preface What 
we  have said  in  this  Foreword  is  only  meant  to  be  a  sketch 
a  preliminary help  and the same applies to the analyses  that 
have been added to the translated paragraphs of the text They 
are meant  to  orient  the reader in  the  thickets of the  text  not 
to provide exhaustive or wholly reliable guidance  They have 
been  found  useful  by  my  students  and  may  prove  useful  to 
others  Mr  Miller  has  further  translated  the  text  with  great 
care and faithfulness but no amount of either will achieve uncid
ambiguous perspicuity where  the  text faHto  provide it 

At the end of these remarks it may be asked whether Hegels 
selfjustifying  circular series  of spiritual  characterizations  has 
done anything like  show that the real must coincide with  the 
intelligible  or that  the  truth  about  anything  will  consist  in 
its  teleological  reltinn to  the emergence of spiritual  selfconcid
sciousness He hascertainly shown up the absurdity of believing 
in objective arrangements which  are  wholly  out  of gear  with 
our categories  and  our thoughtdemands  and  which  are  not 
at all accommodated to our theoretical requirements or toour 
practical approaches and endeavours But has he exorcised  the 
doubt that there may be sides of the world  which  will  remain 
obstinately and depressingly unintelligible and which are withcid
out a significant teleological relation to our spiritual goals and 
endeavours  and  which  may  in  the  end  bring  these  all  to 
nought  These doubts  to  which  the  state  of science  and  the 
state of the world lend some substance are not  however such 
as can he considered in this  Foreword  nor is  it clear by what 
process of reasoning  dialectical  or other  they  could  be  adecid
quately exorcised

TRANSLATORS  FOREWORD 

T HIS  translation  of Hegels  Phenomenology  of Spirit  has  been 
made fro the fifth edition  F Meiner Hamburg   edited 
by J Hoffmeister  In attempting to convey Hegels thought to 
the English  reader who has  no  German  I  have done my best 
to steer a  course which avoiding loose  paraphrase  departs at 
times from a  rigid  consistency in rendering Hegelian locutions 
where this seemed to be more helpful to the reader I  have been 
sparing in  the use  of capitals and  in general  have  only  used 
them for terms which have a  peculiarly Hegelian connotation 
The German Verstand I have translated by the Understanding 
Where  the  capital is  omitted  the  word  has  the  usual  English

The translation was undertaken at the suggestion of Professor

PREFACE  ON  SCIENTIFIC 

COGNITION 

I  It is  custoary to  preface a work With an  explanation of 
the authors aim  why he wrote the book  and  the relationship 
in which he believes it to stand to other earlier or contemporary 
treatises  on  the  same subject  In  the  case  of a  philosophical 
work however such an explanation seems not only superfluous 
bu t in view of the nature of the su bjectmatter even inapprocid
priate and  misleading  For  whatever  might  appropriately  be 
said  about philosophy in  a  prefacesay  a  historical  statement 
of the main drift and the point of view the general content and 
results  a  string  of random  assertions  and  assurances  about 
truthnone  of this  can  be  accepted  as  the  way  in  which  to 
expound  philosophical  truth  Also  since  philosophy  moves 
essentially in the element of universality which includes within 
itself the particular it might seem that here more than in any 
of the other sciences  the subjectmatter itself  and  even  in  its 
complete nature were expressed in the aim and the final results 
the executionbeing by contrast really the unessential factor On 
the other hand in the ordinary view of anatomy for  instance 
say the knowledge of the parts of the body regarded as inanicid
mate we are quite sure thatwe do not as yet possess the subcid
jectmatter itself  the content of this science but must in addicid
tion exert ourselves to know the particulars Further in the case 
of such an aggregate of information which has no right to bear 
the name of Science an opening talk about aim and other such 
generalities is usually conducted in the same historical and uncid
comprehending way in which  the content itself these  nerves 
muscles  etc  is  spoken  of  In  the  case  of philosophy  on  the 
other hand this  would give rise  to  the incongruity  that along 
with  the employment of such  a  method  its  inability  to  grasp 
the  truth would  also  be demonstrated 

  Furthermore  the  very  attempt  to  define  how  a  philocid

sophical  work is  supposed  to  be  connected  with  other efforts 
to  deal  with  the  same subjectmatter  drags  in  an  extraneous 
concern and what is  really important for  the cognition of the 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

truth is  obscured  The more conventional opinion gets  fixated 
on the antithesis of truth and falsity  the more it tends to expect 
a  given  philosophical  system  to  be  either  accepted  or  concid
tradicted  and  hence it  finds  only acceptance  or  rejection  It 
does not comprehend  the diversity of philosophical systems  as 
the progressive unfolding of truth  but  rather sees  in it simple 
disagreements The bud disappears in the burstingforth of the 
blossom  and one  might say  that the former is  refuted  by  the 
latter similarly when the fruit appears  the blossom  is  shown 
up in its turn as a false manifestation of the plant and the fruit 
now emerges as the truth of it instead These forms  are not just 
distinguished from one another they also supplant one another 
as  mutually  incompatible  Yet  at  the  same  time  their  fluid 
nature makes them moments of an organic unity in which they 
not only do not conflict  but in which  each is  as  necessary  as 
the other and  this  mutual necessity  alone  constituts the  life 
of the  whqle  But  he  who  rejects  a  philosophical  systerp  Le 
the new ppilosopher J does not usually comprehend what he is 
doing in this way and he whograspsJhe contradiction between 
them ie  the historian of philosophy  does  not  as  a  general 
rule  Jcnow  how to free  itfroIP itsonesidedness  or  maintain 
it  in  its  freeqom  by  recognizing  the  reciprocally  necessary 
motpents that take shape as  a  cOlfiictand seeming incompaticid
bility 

  Demanding  and  SJlpplyirtg  these  superficial  explanacid
tiops passes readily enQugh as  a  concern with what is  essential 
Where could  the inner meaning of a  philosophical  work find 
fuller  expression  than in its  airps  and  resultsanq how  could 
these be more exactly known than by distinguishing them from 
everything else  the age  brings forth  in  this  sphere  Yet  when 
trtisactivity is taken for more than the mere beginnings of cognicid
tion  when  it is  allowed  to  pass  for  actual  cognition  then  it 
shOHld  be reckoned  as  no more  than a  device for  evading the 
real  issue  die  Sache  selhstJ  a way of creating an  impression  of 
hard work and serious commitment to the problem whileactucid
ally sparing  oneself both  For  the  real  issue  is  not  exhausted 
by stating it as an aim  but by carrying it out nor is  the result 
the actual whole but rather the result together with the process 
through which it came about The aim by itselfis a  lifeless  unicid
versal just as  the guiding tendency is  a  mere drive  that as  yet 

PREFACE 

 
lacks an actual existence and the bare result is the corpse which 
has left the guiding tendency behind it  Similarly  the specific 
difference  of a  thing  is  rather  its  limit  it  is  where  the  thing 
stops or it is  what the  thing is  not  This concern  with  aim or 
results with differentiating and passing judgement on various 
thinkers is  therefore an easier task than it might seem  For incid
stead of getting involved in the real issue  this  kind of activity 
is always away beyond it instead of tarrying with it and losing 
itselfin it this kind of knowing is forever grasping at something 
new  it  remains  essentially  preoccupied  with  itself instead  of 
being preoccupied  with the real issue  and  surrendering  to  it 
To judge a  thing  that has substance and  solid  worth  is  quite 
easy to comprehend itis much harder and to blend judgement 
and  comprehension  in  a  definitive description  is  the  hardest 
thing of all 

  Culture and its laborious emergence from  the immediacy 
of substantial life must always begin by getting acquainted with 
general  principles and  points  of view  so as  at first  to  work  up 
to a general conception Gedanke  of the real issue as  well as learncid
ing to support and refute the general conception with reasons 
then  to apprehend  the rich  and  concrete  abundance  of life 
by  differential  classification  and  finally  to  give  accurate  incid
struction and pass serious judgement upon it From its very becid
ginning  culture must leave  room for the earnestness of life in 
its concrete richness this leads the way to an experience of the 
real issue  And even when  the real issue  has  been  penetrated 
to its depths by serious speculative effort  this kind  of knowing 
and judging will  still  retain its  appropriate place in  ordinary 
conversation 

  The true shape in which truth exists can only be thesciencid

tific  system  of such  truth  To help bring philosophy  closer  to 
the form  of Science  to the goal where it can lay aside the title 
love  of knowing  and  be actual  knowingthat is  what  I  have 
set  myself to  do  The inner necessity  that  knowing should  be 
Science lies  in  its  nature  and  only  the  systematic  exposition 
of philosophy itself provides it  But the external necessity so far 
as ids grasped in a general way setting aside accidental matters 
of person and motivation is  the same as the inner or in other 
words it lies in the shape in which time sets forth  the sequential 
existence of its moments To show that now is the time for philo

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

 
sophy  to  be  raised  to  the  status  of a  Science  would  therefore 
be  the  only  true justification  of any  effort  that  has  this  aim 
for to do so would demonstrate the necessity of the aim  would 
indeed  at  the  same  time  be  the accomplishing of it 

  To lay down  that  the  true  shape  of truth  is  scientificcid

or what is  the same thing  to maintain that truth has only the 
Notion as  the element of its  existenceseems I  know  to  con 
tradict a view which is in our time as  prevalent as  it is  preten 
tious and to go  against what that view implies  Some explana 
don  therefore  seems  called  for  even  though  it  mllst  for  the 
present  be  no more  than  a  bare  assertion  like  the  view  that 
it contradicts If namely the True exists only in what or better 
as  what  is  sometimes  called  intuition  sometimes  immediate 
knowledge of the Absolute religion or beingnot at the centre 
of divine love but the being of the divine love itselfthen what 
is  required  in  the  exposition  of philosophy is  from  this  viewcid
point  rather the opposite  of the form  of the  Notion  For  the 
Absolute is  not supposed  to  be  comprehended  it is  to  be  felt 
and intuited  not the  Notion  of the Absolute  but  the feeling 
and  intuition  of it  must  govern  what  is  said  and  must  be 
expressed  by it 

  Ifwe apprehend a demand of this kind in its broader concid

text and view it as  it appears at the stage which selfaconseious 
Spirit has presently reached it is clear that Spirit has now got 
beyond  the  substantial  life  it  formerly  led  in  the  element  of 
thought  that it is  beyond  the immediacy of faith  beyond te 
satisfaction and security of the certainty that consciousness then 
had  of its  reconciliation  with  the essential  being  and  of that 
beings universal presence both within and without  It has not 
only gone beyond all this into the other extreme of an insubstan 
tial reflection of itself into itself but beyond that too  Spirit has 
not oply  lost  its  essential  life  it  is  also  conscious  of this  loss 
and of the finitude  that is  its own content Turning away from 
the  empty  husks  and  confessing  that  it lies  in  wickedness  it 
reviles itself for so  doing  and  now  demands from  philosophy 
not so  much  knowledge  of what  it  is  as  the  recovery  through 
its agency of that lost sense of solid and substantial being Philocid
sophy is  to  meet  tbis  need  not  by opening up  the fastlocked 
nature of substance  and  raising  this  to selfconsciousness  not 
by bringing consciousness out ofits chaos back to an order based 

PREFACE 

 
on thought nor to  the simplicity of the Notion  but rather by 
running together what thought has put asunder by suppressing 
the differentiations  of the  Notion  and  restoring  the feeling  of 
essential  being in short  by providing edification rather than 
insight The beautiful the holy the eternal religion and 
love are the bait required to arouse the desire  to bite not the 
Notion  but  ecstasy  not  the  cold  march  of necessity  in  the 
thing itself  but the ferment of enthusiasm  these  are supposed 
to  be what sustains and continually extends the wealth ofsub 
stance 

B  In  keeping  with  this  demand  is  the  strenuous  almost 
overzealous and  frenzied  effort  to  tear men away from  their 
preoccupation with the sensuous  from  their ordinary  private 
einzelne  affairs and to direct their gaze to  the stars as  if they 
had forgotten all about the divine and were ready like worms 
to content themselves with dirt and water Formerly they had 
a heaven adorned with a vast wealth of thoughts and imagery 
The meaningofall that is  hung on the thread of light by which 
it was linked to that heaven Instead of dwelling in this worlds 
presence  men  looked  beyond  it  following  this  thread  to  an 
otherworldly presence so  to speak  The eye of the Spirit had 
to be forcibly turned and held fast  to the things  of this  world 
and  it  has  taken  a  long  time  before  the  lucidity  which  ony 
heavenly things  used to  have could penetrate the dullness and 
confusion in which  the sense of worldly  things was  enveloped

fast  rooted in earthly things that it requires just as much force

a wanderer in the deserLcraving for a  mere mouthful of water 
it seems to crave for its refreshment only the bare feeling of the 
divine in  general  By  the  little  which  now satisfies  Spirit  we 
can measure  the  extent of its  loss

ample  opportunity  to  dream  up  something  for  himself  But 
philosophy must  beware of the  wish  to  be  edifying 

  Still  less  must  this  complacency which  abjures  Science 
claim that such rapturous haziness is superior to Science This 
prophetic talk supposes that it is staying right in the centre and 
in  the  depths  looks  disdainfully  at  determinateness  Horos  
and deliberately holds alooffrom Notion and Necessity as  procid
ducts of that reflection which is  at home only in the finite  But 
just as there is an empty breadth so too there is an empty depth 
and just as  there is  an  extension  of substance  that pours forth 
as a finite multiplicity without the force to hold the multiplicity 
together so there is an intensity without content one that holds 
itself in as  a  sheer force  without spread  and  this  is  in no way 
distinguishable from superficiality The power of Spirit is  only 
as great as  its  expression  its  depth only as  deep as it dares  to 
spread out and lose itselfin its exposition  Moreover when this 
nonconceptual substantial knowledge  professes  to  have sunk 
the idiosyncrasy of the self in  essential  being  and  to  philosocid
phize in a  true and holy manner it hides the truth from  itself 
by spurning measure and  definition  instead  of being devoted 
to God it merely gives free rein both to the contingency of the 
content within it  and  to  its  own  caprice  Such  minds  when 
they  give  themselves  up  to  the  uncontrolled  ferment  of the 
divine  substance  imagine  that  by drawing  a  veil  over  selfcid
consciousness and surrendering understanding they become the 
beloved of God to whom He gives wisdom in sleep and hence 
what they in fact  receive  and  bring  to  birth in their sleep  is 
nothing  but dreams 

I  I  Besides  it is not difficult to see that ours  is  a  birthtime 
and a period of transition to a  new era Spirit has  broken with 
the world  it has hitherto inhabited  and imagined  and is  of a 
mind  to submerge it in the past  and in the labour of its  own 
transformation  Spirit  is  indeed  never  at  rest  but  always 
engaged in moving forward  But just as  the first breath drawn 
by a child after its long quiet nourishment breaks the gradualcid
ness of merely quantitative growththere is a qualitative leap 
and  the  child is  bornso likewise  the  Spirit  in  its  formation 
matures slowly and  quietly  into  its  new  shape  dissolving  bit 
by bit the structure ofits previous world whose tottering state

nates  the features  of the  new  world 

  But this new world is no more a complete actuality than 
is a newborn child it is essential to bear this in mind It comes 
on  the scene for  the first  time in its  immediacy or its  Notion 
Just as  little  as  a  building is  finished  when  its foundation  has 
been laid so Ii ttle is  the achieved Notion of the whole the whole

spreading branches and foliage we are not content to be shown 
an acorn instead So too Science the crown ora world of Spirit

common to Science and the unscientific cDnsciousness alike the 
latter through its  having afforded  direct access  to  the former 
  Science in its early stages  when  it has attained  neither 
to completeness of detail nor perfection  of form  is  vulnerable 
to criticism But it would be as unjust for such criticism to strike 
at the very heart of Science as it is untenable tD refuse to honour 
the  demand  for  its  further  development  This  polarization 
seems  to  be  the GDrdian  knot with  which scientific  culture  is 
at present struggling and which it still does not properly undercid
stand  One side  boasts of its  wealth  of material  and  intelligicid
bility  the  other  side  at  least  scorns  this  intelligibility  and 
flaunts  its  immediate  rationality  and  divinity  Even  if  the 
former side is reduced  to silene  whether by the force of truth 
alone or by the blustering of the other  and even  i in respect 
of fundamentals  it feeJs  itself outmatched  it is  by  no  means 
satisfied regarding the said demands  for they are justified but 
not fulfilled  Its silence stems only halffrom the triumph of its 
opponeflt and halffrom the boredom and indifference which 
tend  to  result  from  the  continual  awakening  of expectations 
through  unfulfilled  promises

themselves at times todisplaya great expanse of it They approcid

appears  that  everything  has  been  subjected  to  the  absolute

to have matyred into an expanded science But a closer inspeccid

volves nothing more than this sort of repetition of the same for 
mula  When  the  knowing  subject  goes  around  applying  this 
single inert form  to  whatever  it  encounters  and  dipping  the 
material into  this  placid element from outside  this  is  no  more 
the  fulfilment  of what  is  needed  ie  a  selforiginating  selfcid
differentiating wealth of shapes than any arbitrary insights into 
the  content  Rather  it is  a  monochromatic  formalism  which 
only arrives at the differentiation of its  material since  this  has 
been already provided and is  by now familiar 

  Yet this formalism  maintains  that  such  monotony  and 
abstract universality are the Absolute and we  are assured that 
dissatisfaction with it indicates the inability to master the absocid
lute standpoint and to keep hold of it Time was when the bare 
possibility of imagining something differently was sufficient  to 
refute an idea and  this  bare possibility  this genera  thought 
also had the entire positive value of an aCtual cognition Nowacid
days we see all value ascribed to the universal Idea in this noncid
actualform and the undoing of all distinct determinate entities 
orratherthehurling of them aU into the abyss of vacuity withcid
out further development or any justification is allowed to pass 
muster  as  the  speculative  mode  of treatment  Dealing  with 
something ftom the perspective of the Absol u te consis ts  merely 
in declaring that although one has been speaking ofitjust now 
as  something definite  yet in  the Absolute  the  AA  there is 
nothing of the kind for there allis one To pit this single insight 
that in the Absoluteeverythingis the same against thefullbdy 
of articulated cognition which at least seeks and demands such 
fulfilment  to  palm off its  Absolute  as  the  night in  which  as 
the saying goes  all  cows  are  blackthis is  cognition  naIvely 
reduced  to  vacuity  The formalism  which  recent  philosophy 
denounces and despises only to see it reappear in its midst will 
not vanish  from  Science  however  much its  inadequacy  may 
be recognized  and felt  tin  the  cognizing of absolute actuality 
has  become entirely dear as  to its  own  nature  Since the precid
sentation of a  general idea in outline  before  any  attempt  to 
followit out in detail makes the latter attempt easier to grasp 
it may be useful at this point to give a  rough idea of it  at the 
same time  taking  the opportunity to get  rid  of certain  habits 
of thought which impede philosophical cognition 

  In my view which can bejustified only by the exposition 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

of the system itself everything turns on grasping and expressing 
the True  not only as  Substance  but  equally  as  Subject  At  the 
same time it is to be observed  that substantiality embraces the 
universal  or  the  immediacy  Q knowledge  itself  as  well  as  that 
which is  being  or immediacy for  knowledge  If the  conception 
of God  as  the one  Substance shocked  the  age in  which  it  was 
proclaimed  the  reason  for  this  was  on  the  one  hand  an  incid
stinctive  awareness  that  in  this  definition  selfconsciousness 
was  only  submerged  and  not  preserved  On  the  other  hand 
the opposite view  which  clings  to  thought as  thought  to  unicid
versality as such is the very same simplicity is  undifferentiated 
unmoved  substantiality  And  if  thirdly  thought  does  unite 
itselfwith the being of Substance and apprehends immediacy 
or intuition  as  thinking  the  question  is  still  whether  this  incid
tellectual intuition does not again fall back into inert simplicity 
and does not depict actuality itself in a  nonactual manner 

  Further the living Substance is  being which  is  in  truth 
Subject  or  what is  the same  is  in  truth  actual  only in so far 
as  it is  the movement of positing itself  oris the  mediation  of 
its selfothering with itself This Substanceis as Subject pure 
simple  negativity  and isfor  this  very reason  the  bifurcation  of 
the simple itis the doubling wichsetsupopposition and then 
again the negation of this indifferent diversity and of its anti  
thesis  the immediate simplici ty  Only this selfustoring Samecid
ness or this reflection in otherness within itselfnot an original 
or immediate unity as  suchis the True It is  the  process  of its 
own  becoming  the circle  that presupposes its  end as its goal 
having its end also as  its  beginning  and only by being worked 
out to its  end  is  it actual 

  Thus the life  of God  and divine cognition may well  be 
spoken of as a disporting of Love with itself but this idea sinks 
into mere edification and even insipidity  if it lacks the seriouscid
ness the suffering the patience and the lahoQf of thenegative 
In itself that life is indeed one of untroubled equality and unity 
with itself  for  which otherness  and  alienation and  the  overcid
coming of alienation  are  not serious  matters  But  this  initself 
is  abstract  universality  in  which  the nature of the  divine  life 
to  he for  itself  and so  too  the selfmovement  of the  form  are 
altogether left out of account  If the form  is  declared to be the 
same as  the essence  then  it  is  ipso facto  a  mistake  to  suppose

that cognition can be satisfied with the initself or the  essence 
butcan get along without the formthat the absolute principle 
or absolute intuition  makes  the workingout of the former  or 
the  development  of the  latter  superfluous  Just  because  the 
form is  as  essential to  the essence as  the  essence  is  to  itself  the 
divine essence is  not to  be conceived and expressed  merely as 
essence ie as immediate substance or pure selfcontemplation 
of the divine but likewise  as form  and in the  whole  wealth of 
the  developed form  Only  then  is  it conceived  and  expressed 
as  an actuality 

  The True is  the  whole  But the  whole is  nothing  other 
than the essence consummating itself through its development 
Of the Absolute it must be said that it is essentially a result  that 
only in  the end  is  it what it truly is  and that precisely in  this 
consists  its  nature viz  to  be  actual  subject  the  spontaneous 
becoming ofitsdf Though it may seem contradictory that the 
Absolute should be  conceived  essentially  as  a  result  it needs 
little pondering to set this show of contradiction in its true Ugh t 
The beginning the principle or the Absolute as at first immecid
diately enunciated is only the universal Just as when I say all 
animals  this  ex pression  cannot  pass  for  a  zoology  so  it  is 
equally plain that the words  the Divine the Absolute  the 
Eternal  etc  do not express what is  contained in  them  and 
only such words in fact  do express  the intuition as something 
immediate Whatever is more than such a word even the transicid
tion  to  a  mere  proposition  contains  a  becomingother  that  has 
to  be  taken back  or is  a  mediation  But  it  is  just  this  that  is 
rejected with  horror  as  if absolute cognition  were  beingsur 
rendered when more is made of mediation than in simply saying 
that  it  is  nothing  absolute  and  is  completely  absent  in  the 
Absolute 

 I  But this  abhorrence in fact stems from ignorance of the 

nature of media tion  and of absolute cognition itself For mediacid
tion is nothing beyond selfmoving selfsameness or is reflection 
into self the moment of the  which is for itself pure negativity 
or when reduced  to its  pure abstraction simple  becoming  The 
I or becoming in general  this  mediation  on  account of its 
simple nature  is just immediacy  in  the  process  of becoming 
and is the immediate itself Reason is therefore misunderstood 
when reflection is  excluded from  the True and is  not grasped 

PHENOMENOLOGY OF  SPIRIT 

 
as a positive moment of the Absolute It is  reflection that makes 
the  True a  result  but  it  is  equally  reflection  that  overcomes 
the antithesis between the process of its becoming and the result 
for this becoming is also simple and therefore not different from 
the  form  of the  True which shows  itself as  simple  in  its  result 
the process of becoming is  rather just this return into simplicity 
Thoughthe embryo is  indeed in  itselfa human being  it is  not 
sr itself  this  it only is  as  cultivated Reason which has made 
itself into what it is  in  itself  And  that  is  when  it for  the  first 
time is  actual  But  this  result  is  itself a  simple  immediacy for 
it is  selfconscious freedom  at  peace  with itself  which  has  not 
set the antithesis on one side and left it lying there but has been 
reconciled  with  it 

  What has just been said can also be expressed  by saying 
that Reason  is  purposive  activity  The  exaltation  of a  supposed 
Nature over a misconceived  thinking and especially the rejeccid
tion of external  teleology  has  brought  the form  of purpose in 
general into discredit Still in the sense in which Aristotle too 
defines  Nature as  purposive activity  purpose is  what is  immeD 
diate and at  rest  the  unmoved which is  also selfmoving  and as 
such  is  Subject  I ts  power  to  move  Uiken  abstractly  is  being  
fOfself or pure negativity  The result is  the same  as  the  hegin 
ning only because the beginning  is  the purpose  in  other words 
the actual is the same as its Notion only because the immediate 
as purpose contains the self or pureactuaHty within itself  The 
realized purpose or the existentactuality is  movement and un 
folded  becoming but its just this  unrest  that is  the self  and 
the self is  like  that immediacy and simplicity of the  beginning 
because it is  the  result  that which has returned into itself  the 
latter being similarly just the self  And  the self is  the sameness 
and simplicity  that  relates  itself to  itself 

  The need  to  represent the Absolute as  Subject  has  found 
expression  in  the  propositions  God  is  the  eternal  the  moral 
worldorder love and so  on  In such  propositions  the True is 
only posited  immediately as  Subject but is  not presented as  the 
movement of reflecting itself into itself  In a proposition of this 
kind one begins with the word God This by itselfis a rneaning 
less sound a mere name it is  only the  predicate that says  what 
God is gives Him content and meaning  Only in  the end of the 
proposition  does  the  empty  beginning  become  actual  know

PREFACE 

 

ledge  This  being so  it is  not  clear  why  one  does  not  speak 
merely of the eternal of the moral worldorder and so  on or 
as  the ancients did of pure notions like  being the One and 
so on in short of that which gives  the meaning without adding 
the meanzngless sound as  wen  But it is just this  word  that indi 
cates  that what is  posited  is  not  a  being  ie  something  that 
merely is or essence or a universal in general but rather somecid
thing that is reflected into itself a Subject But at the same time 
this is  only anticipated The Subject is  assumed as  a fixed  point 
to which as their support the predicates are affixed by a move  
ment belonging to the knower of this Subject and which is  not 
regarded  as  belonging  to  the  fixed  point  itself  yet  it is  only 
through  this  movement that the content could  be represented 
as Subject The way in which this  movement has  been brought 
about is such that it cannot belong to the fixed  point yet  after 
this  point has  been  presupposed  the  nature  of the  movement 
cannot really be other than what it is  it can only  be  externaL 
Hence  the  mere anticipation  that  the  Absolute  is  Subject  is 
not only not  the actuality of this Notion  but it even makes the 
actuality impossible for  the  anticipation  posits  the subject as 
an  inert point whereas  the actuality is  selfmovement 

  Amongthe various consequences  that follow from what 
has just been said  this  one  in  particular can be stressed  that 
knowledge  is  only  actual  and  can  only  be  expounded  as 
Science or as system and furthermore that a socalled basic pro  
position  or  principle  of philosophy  if true  is  also  false  just 
because it is  only  a  principle  It is  therefore  easy  to refute it 
The refutation consists in pointing out its defect and it is defeccid
tive because it is only the universal or principle is  only the be  
ginning  If the  refutation  is  thorough  it  is  derived  and  decid
velopedfrom the principle itself not accomplished by countercid
assertions  and  random  thoughts from  outside  The  refutation 
would  therefore  properly consist in  the  further  development 
of the  principle and in  thus  remedying  the  defectiveness  if it 
did  not  mistakenly  pay  attention  solely  to  its  negative  action 
without awareness of its progress and result on their positive side 
tooThe genuinely positive exposition of the beginning is  thus 
also  conversely just as  much  a  negative  attitude  towards  it 
viz  towards  its  initially  onesided  form  of being  immediate  or 
purpose  It can  therefqre  be  taken  equally  well  as  a  refutation 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF SPIRIT 

of the  principle  that constitutes  the  basis  of the  system  but it 
is  more  correct  to  regard  it as  a  demonstration  that  the  basis 
or principle of the system  is  in fact  only  its  beginning 

  That the True is actual only as system or that Substance 
is  essentially Subject  is  expressed  in  the  representation of the 
Absolute as Spiritthe most sublime Notion and the one which 
belongs to the modern age and its  religion  The spiritual alone 
is  the actual  it is  essence  or that which  has  being  in  itself  it is 
that which relates  itself to  itself and is  de termnate  it is  otherbeing 
and beingforsel and in this determinateness or in its selfextercid
nality abides within itself in other words it is  in andfor itselfcid
But this  beinginandforitself is  at first only for  us  or in  itself 
it is  spiritual Substance  It must also  be this for  itself  it  must be 
the  knowledge  of the spiritual  and  the  knowledge  of itself as 
Spirit ie  it must be an object  to itself but just as  immediately 
a sublated object reflected into itself  It islor itself only for  us 
in so  far  as  its  spiritual  content  is  generated  by  itself  But  in 
so far as it is  also for  itself for  its  own self  this  selfgeneration 
the  pure Notion is  for  it the objective element in which it has 
its  existence and it is  in  this  way  in  its  existence for  itself  an 
object reflected into itself The Spirit that so developed knows 
itself as  Spirit is  Science  Science is  its  actuality and  the realm 
which it builds for  itself in  its  own element 

  Pure selfrecognitionin absolute otherness this Aether as 
such  is  the  ground  and  soil  of Science  or knowledge  in  general 
The beginning of philosophy presupposes or requires  that concid
sciousness  should  dwell  in  this  element  But  this  element  itself 
achieves its own perfection and transparency only through the 
movement of its becoming It is  pure spirituality as the universal 
that has  the form  of simple  immediacy  This  simple  being  in 
its  existential form  is  the soil  of Science  it  is  thinking  which 
has its  being in Spirit alone  Because  this  element  this immecid
diacy of Spirit  is  the very  substance  of Spirit  it  is  the  trans
figured essence  reflection which is  itself simple  and which is  for 
itself  immediacy  as  such  being  that  is  reflected  into  itself 
Science on its part requires that selfconsciousness should have 
raised  itself into  this  Aether in  order  to  be  able  to  liveand 
actually to livewith Science and in Science Conversely the 
individual has the right to demand that Science should at least 
provide  him with  the  ladder  to  this  standpoint  should show 

PREFACE 

him  this  standpoint  within  himself  His  right  is  based  on  his 
absolute  independence  which he  is  conscious  of possessing  in 
every phase of his  knowledge for in each one  whether  recog 
nized by Science or not and whatever the content may be  the 
individual is  the absolute form  ie  he  is  the  immediate  certainty 
of himself and  if this  expression  be  preferred  he  is  therefore 
unconditioned  being  The  standpoint  of consciousness  which 
knows objects in their antithesis to itself and itself in antithesis 
to them is for Science the antithesis of its  own standpoint  The 
situation  in  which consciousness  knows  itself to  be  at home  is 
for  Science  one  marked  by the absence  of Spirit  Conversely 
the element of Science is  for consciousness a  remote beyond in 
which it no longer possesses itself  Each of these  two aspects of 
selfconscious  Spirit  appears  to  the  other  as  the  inversion  of 
truth  When  natural  consciousness  entrusts  itself straightway 
to Science it makes an attempt induced by it knows not what 
to walk on its head toojust this once the compulsion to assume 
this  unwonted posture and  to  go about in  it is  a  violence it is 
expected to do to itself all unprepared and seemingly without 
necessity Let Science be in its own self what it may relatively 
to immediate selfconsciousness it presents itself in an inverted 
posture or because this self  consciousness  has  the principle of 
its  actual existence  in  the  certainty  of itself  Science  appears 
to  it  not  to  be  actual  since  selfconsciousness  exists  on  its 
own account outside  of Science  Science must therefore  unite 
this elementnfselfcertainty with itself or rather show that  and 
how this element belongs to iLSo long as Science lacks this actual 
dimension it is only the content as  the initself  the purpose  that 
is as yet still something inward not yet Spirit but only spiritual 
Substance  This  nitself has  to  express  itself  outwardly  and 
becQrnejor itself and this means simply that it has  to  posit selfcid
consciousness  as  one with itself 

  It is  this  coming  tobe of Science  as  such  or  of knowledge 
that is  described in  this  Phenomenology  of Spirit  Knowledge  in 
its first phase or immediate Spirit  is  the nonspiritual  Ie  sense 
consciousness  In order to  become  genuine  knowledge  to  beget 
the element of Science which is the pure Notion of Science itself 
it must  travel  a  long way  and  work  its  passage  This  process 
of comingtobe  considering the content and  patterns  it  will 
display therein  will  not be  what is  commonly understood  by 

PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT 

an initiation of the  unscientific  consciousness  into  Science  it 
will  also  be  quite  different from  the  foundation  of Science 
least of all will it be like  the  rapturous enthusiasm which  like 
a shot from a  pistol  begins straight away with absolute knowcid
ledge and makes short work of other standpoints by declaring 
that it takes  no notice of them 

  The task of leading the individual from  his  uneducated 
standpoint to knowledge had to  be seen  in  its  universal  sense 
just  as  it  was  the  universal  individual  selfconscious  Spirit 
whose formative  education had  to  be studied  As  regards  the 
relation between them every moment as it gains concrete form 
and a sha pe ofi ts own dis pIa ys i tsefin the universal individual 
The single individual is  incomplete Spirit a  concrete shape in 
whose  whole existence  one  determinateness  predominates  the 
others  being present only in  blurred outline  In  a  Spirit  that 
is  more advanced  than another  the  lower  concrete  existence 
has been reduced  to  an inconspicuous  moment what used  to 
be  the  important  thing  is  now  but  a  trace  its  pattern  is 
shrouded to  become a  mere shadowy outline  The  individual 
whosesuhstance is the more advanced Spirit runs through  this 
past just as one who takes up a  higher science goes  through the 
preparatory studies he haslongsince absorbed in order to bring 
their content to mind  he recalls  them  to  the inward eye  but 
has no lasting interest in them The single individual must also 
pass  through  the formative stages of universal  Spirit so far  as 
their  content  is  concerned  blJt  as  shapes  which  Spirit  has 
already left behind as stages on a way that has been made level 
with toil  Thus as far as  factual  information is  concerned  we 
find  that what in former ages engaged the attention of men of 
mature mind has been reduced  to the level of facts  exercises

itself 

  Science sets  forth  this  formative  process  in  all  its  detail 
and necessity exposing the mature configuration of everything 
which has already been reduced to a  moment and property of 
Spirit  The goal  is  Spirits  insight  into  what knowing  is  Imcid
patience demands the impossible to  wit  the attainment of the 
end without  the  means  But  the  length  of this  path  has  to  be 
endured because for one thing each moment is necessary and 
further  each  moment has  to  be lingered  over  because  each  is 
itself a  complete individual shape  and  one  is  only  viewed  in 
absolute perspective when  its  determinateness is  regarded as  a 
concrete whole or the whole is  regarded as  uniquely qualified 
by that determination  Since  the Substance of the individual 
the WorldSpirit itself  has  had  the  patience  to  pass  through 
these  shapes  over the  long passage  of time  and  to  take  upon 
itself  the  enormous  labour  of  worJdhistory  in  which  it 
embodied in each shape  as  much of its  entire content as  that 
shape  was  capable  of holding  and  since  it  could  not  have 
attained consciousness of itself by any lesser effort  the indivicid
dual  certainly cannot  by  the  nature  of the  case  comprehend 
his  own substance more easily  Vetat the same  time  he does 
have  less  trouble  since  aH  this  has  already  been  implicitly 
accompJished  the content is  already  the actuality reduced  to 
a  possibility its immediacy overcome and the embodied shape 
reduced to abbreviated simple determinations  of thought  It 
is  no longer existence in  the form of beinginitselfneither still 
in  the original form  oian abstract concept  nor submerged 
in  existencebut is  now  the  recollected  initself  ready fot  concid

  We take up the  movement of the  whole from  the  point 
where the sublation of existence as  such is  no longer necessary 
what remains  to  be done  and what requires a  higher level  of 
cultural  reorientation  is  to  represent  and  to  get  acquainted 
with these forms  The existence that has  been  taken  back into 
the Substance has only been immediately transposed into the elecid
men t of the self through tha tfirs t negation Hence this acquired 
property  still  has  the  same  character  of  uncomprehended 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

immediacy of passive indifference as  existence itself existence 
has  thus  merely passed  over in to figurative  representation  At  the 
same  time  it is  thus  something familiar  something which  the 
existent Spirit is  finished  and done with so  that it is  no longer 
active or really interested in it  Although the  activity  that has 
finished with existence is  itself only  the  movement of the  parcid
ticular  Spirit  the  Spirit  that  does  not  comprehend  itself 
genuine  knowing on the other hand  is  directed against  the 
representation  thus  formed  against  this  mere  familiarity 
knowing  is  the  activity  of the  universal  self  the  concern  of 
thinking 

  Quite generally  the familiar just because it is familiar 
is  not cognitively  understood  The  commonest  way  in  which 
we  deceive  either  ourselves  or  others  about  understanding is 
by  assuming something as  familiar  and  accepting  it  on  that 
account  with all  its  pros  and  cons  such  knowing  never  gets 
anywhere  and it knows  not  why  Subject  and  object  God 
Nature Understanding sensibility and so on are uncritically 
taken for granted  as  familiarestablished  as  valid  and  made 
intoJixed points for starting and stopping  While these remain 
unmoved  the knowing activity goes  back  and forth  between 
them  thus  moving only  on  their surface  Apprehending and 
testing likewise  consist in seeing whether everybodys imprescid
sion of the  matter coincides  with what is asserted  about  these 
fixed  points  whether it seems  that way  to  him or not 

  The analysis of an idea as  it used  to be carried out was 
in fact nothing else than ridding it of the form in which it had 
become familiar To break an idea up into its original elements 
is to return to its moments which at least do not have the form 
of the given idea but rather constitute the immediate property 
of the sef This analysis to besure only arrives at thoughts which 
are  themseves  familiar  fixed  and  inert determinations  But 
what is  thus separated and  nonactual is  an  essential  moment 
for it is only because the concrete does divide itself  and  make 
itself into  something  nonactual  that it is  selfmoving  The 
activity of dissolution is  the power and work of the Understandcid
ing  the most astonishing and mightiest of powers or rather the 
absolute power The circle that remains selfenclosed and like 
substance  holds its  moments  together  is  an  immediate  relacid
tionship one therefore which has nothing astonishing about it

But that an accident as such detached from what circumscribes 
it what is  bound and is  actual only in its context with others 
should attain an existence of its own and a separate freedom 
this is  the  tremendous power of the  negative  it is  the  energy 
of thought  of the pure I Death if that is  what we  want  to 
call  this  nonactuality  is  of all  things  the  most  dreadful  and 
to hold fast what is dead requires the greatest strength Lacking 
strength Beauty hates the Understanding for asking of her what 
it cannot do  But the life  of Spirit  is  not  the  life  that shrinks 
from  death  and  keeps  itself  untouched  by  devastation  but 
rather the life  that endures it and maintains itself in it It wins 
its truth only when in utter dismemberment  it finds  itself  It 
is  this  power  not as  something positive  which  closes  its  eyes 
to the negative as when we say of something that it is  nothing 
o is false  and  then having done with it  turn away and  pass 
on tOsomething else on the contrary Spirit is  this  power only 
by looking the negative in the face  and  tarrying with it  This 
tarrying with the negative is  the magical power that converts 
itinto being This PQweris identical with what we earlier called 
the Subject  which  by giving determinateness an existence  in 
its own element supersedes abstract immediacy ie  the immecid
diacy  which  barelyis  and  thus  is  authentic  substance  that 
being or immediacy whose  mediation is  not outside  of it  but 
which is  this  mediation itself 

  The fact that the object represented  becomes  the propcid

erty of pure self  consciousness  its  elevation  to  universality in 
general is only oneaspect of formative education not its fulfilcid
ment The manner of study in ancient times differed from that 
of the modern age in that the former was the proper and com  
plete formation  of the natural  consciousness  Putting itself to 
the test at every point of its existence and philosophizing about 
everything it came across it made itself into a  universality that 
was  active  thrQugh  and  through  In  modern  times  however 
the individual finds  the abstract form  readymade  the  effort 
to grasp and appropriate it is  more  the direct drivingforth  of 
what is  within and  the  truncated  generation  of the  universal 
than it is  the emergence of the latter from  the concrete variety 
of existence  Hence the task  nowadays consists not so  much in 
purging  the  individual  of  an  immediate  sensuous  mode  of 
apprehension  and  making  him  into  a  substance  that  is  an 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

object of thought and that thinks but rather injust the opposite 
in freeing  determinate  thoughts from  their fixity  so  as  to give 
actuality  to  the  universal  and  impart  to  it  spiritual  life  But 
it is  far  harder to bring fixed  thoughts into a  fluid  state  than 
to do so with sensuous existence  The reaon for this  was given 
above fixed  thoughts have the I  the  power of the  negative 
or pure actuality for  the substance and element of their existcid
ence  whereas  sensuous  determinations  have  only  powerless 
abstract immediacy or being as such  Thoughts  become fluid 
when pure thinking  this inner immediacy  recognizes itself as  a 
moment  or  when  the  pure  certainty  of self  abstracts  from 
itselfnot by leaving itself out  or  setting  itself aside  but  by 
giving  uP  the fixity  of its  selfpositing  by giving  up  not  only 
the fixity of the pure concrete which the I itself is  in contrast 
with  its  differentiated  content  but also  the  fixity  of the  difcid
ferentiated  moments  which  posited  in  the  element  of pure 
thinking  share  the  unconditioned  nature of the  P  Through 
this movement the pure thoughts become Notions  and are only 
now what  they are in  truthselfmovemen ts  drclesspiritual 
essences  which is  what theirsuhstance is 

  This movement of pure essences  constitutes  the nature 
ofsdentific method in generalRegarded as  the connectedness 
of their  content  it is  the necessary  expansion of that content 
into an  organic  whole  Through this  movement  the  path  by 
which the N odon of knowledge is  reached  becomes likewise a 
necessary and complete process of becoming so  that this  precid
paratory path ceases to be a casual philosophizing that fastens 
on to this or that object relationship or thought that happens 
to  pop up in the imperfect consciousness  or tries  to  base  the 
truth on the  pros and cons  the inferences  and  consequences 
of rigidly defined thoughts Instead this pathway  through the 
movement of the Notion  will  encompass  the entire sphere  of 
secular consciousness in its necessary development 

  Further  an  exposition  of this  kind  constitutes  the first 
part of Science  because the existence of Spirit qua  primary is 
nothing but the immediate or the beginningbut not  yet its 
return into itself  The element  of immediate  existence  is  therefore 
what distinguishes  this  part of Science  from  the  others  The 
statement of this distinction leads us  into a  discussion  of SOlne 
fixed  ideas  which  usually  crop up in  this  connection 

PREFACE 

 
  The immediate existence of Spirit consciousness  contains 
the  two  moments  of knowing  and  the  objectivity  negative  to 
knowing Since it is in this clemen t  of consciousness that Spirit 
develops itself and explicates its moments  these moments con  
tain that antithesis and they all appear as shapes of conscious a 
ness The Science of this pathway is the Science of the experience 
which consciousness goes through the substance and its  movecid
ment are viewed as  the object of consciousness  Consciousness 
knows and comprehends only what falls  within its experience 
for what is containedin this is  nothing but spiritual substance 
and this  too  as  object  of the  self  But  Spirit  becomes  object 
because  it is just this  movement of becoming an other  to  itself 
ie becoming an object to itself and of suspending this otherness 
And  experience is  the name we give  to just this  movement  in 
which  the  immediate  the  unexperienced  ie  the  abstract 
whether  it  be  of sensuous  hut still  unsensed  being  or only 
thought of as  simple  becomes  aHenated  from  itself and  then 
returns to itself from  this alienation and is only  then revealed 
for  the  first  time in its actuality  and  truth just as  it then  has 
become  a  property of consciousness  also 

S   The disparity which exists in consciousness between the 
I  and  the  substance  which  is  its  object  is  the  distinction 
between them  the negative in general This can be regarded as 
thedeeet of both  though it is  their soul  or that which  moves 
them  Thatis why some of the ancients conceived  the  void  as 
the principle of motion for they rightly saw  the moving princid
cipleas tbe negative  though they did  not as  yet grasp  that  the 
negative is the self  Now although tbis negative appears at first 
asa disparity between the I and its object  it is just as  much 
the disparity ofthe substance with itself  Thus what seems  to 
happen outside  of it  to  he  an  activity  directed  against  it  is 
really its own doing and Substance shows itsefto be essentially 
Subject  When it has  shown  this  completely  Spirit has  made 
its existence identical with its essence it has itself for its object 
justaslt isand the abstract element of immediacy and of the 
separation  of knowing  and  truth  is  overcome  Being  is  then 
absolutely  mediated  it is  a  substantial  content  which  is just 
as  immediately  the  property  of the  I  it  is  selflike  or  the 
Notion 

With this  the Phenomenology of Spirit is  concluded  What 

 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

Spirit prepares for itself in it is  the element of true knowing 
In this  element  the moments of Spirit now spread  themselves 
out in  thatform oj simplicity  which  knows  its  object as  its own 
self  They no longer fall  apart into  the  antithesis of being and 
knowing  but remain in  the simple oneness  of knowing  they 
are the True in  the form  of the  True  and  their  difference  is 
only the difference of content Their movement which organcid
izes itselfin this element into a whole is Logic or speculative philocid
sophy 

  Now because the system of the experience of Spirit emcid

braces only the appearance of Spirit the advance from this system 
to  the Science  of the  True  in its  true  shape  seems  to  be  merely 
negative and one might wish to be spared the negative as somecid
thIng false  and demand  to  he led  to  the  truth  without  more 
ado Why bother with the falseThe view already discussed 
namely  that we  should  begin  with  Science  straight  away  is 
to  be answered  at this  point  by  examining  the  nature  of the 
negative in general  regarded  as  what is false  This is  a  topic 
regarding  which  established 
the 
approach to truth It will  give  us  occasion to speak of mathecid
matical cognition  which  unphilosophical  knowledge  regards 
as the ideal that philosophy muststrive to attain though it has 
so far  striven in vain 

ideas  notably  obstruct 

  True  and  false  belong  among  those  determinate 
notions which are held to beinert and wholly separate essences 
one here and one there each standing fixed and isolated from 
the other with which it has nothing in common  Against this 
view it must be maintained that truth is not a  minted coin that 
can be  given  and  pocketed  readymade  Nor  is  there  such  a 
thing as  the false  any more  than there is  something evil  The 
evil  and  the false  to  be sure  are not as  bad  as  the devil  for 
in the devil they are even made into a particular suhjective agent 
as the false  and the evil  they are mere  universals  though each 
has its  own essence as  against the other 

The false  for here it is ouly of this  that we speak  would  be 
the other the negative of the substance  which as  the  content 
of knowledge is  the True But the substance is  itself essentially 
the negative  partly as  a  distinction  and determination of the 
content  and  partly as  a  simple  distinguishing  ie  as  self and 
knowledge  in  general  One  can  of course  know  something 

PREFACE 

 

falsely  To know something falsely  means  that  there  is  a  discid
parity between knowledge and its Substance But this very disD 
parity is  the process  of distinguishing in  general  which  is  an 
essential  moment  in knowing  Out of this  distinguishing  of 
course  comes  their identity  and  this  resultant identity is  the 
truth  But it is  not truth  as  if the  disparity  had  been  thrown 
away like dross from pure metal not even like the tool  which 
remains separate from  the finished vessel disparity  rather  as 
the negative  the self  is  itself still  directly present in  the True 
as such Yet we cannot therefore say that the false is a  moment 
of the True  let  alone  a  component part of it  To  say  that  in 
every falsehood there is  a grain of truth is  to treat the two like 
oil and  water which cannot be mixed and are only externally 
combined It is precisely on account of the importance of desigcid
nating the moment of complete otherness that the terms true and 
false  must no longer be used  where such otherness  has  been 
annulled  Just as  to  talk of the  unity  of subject  and  object  of 
finite  and  infinite of being  and  thought  etc  is  inept  since 
object  and  subject etc  signify  what  they  are  outside  of their 
unity and since in their unity they are not meant  to be what 
their expression says they are just so the false  is  no longer qua 
false  a  moment of truth 

  Dogmatism  as  a  way  of thinking  whether  in  ordinary 
knowing or in the study of philosophy  is  nothing  else  but the 
opinion that the True consists in a  proposition which isa fixed 
result  or which is immediately known  To such questions as 
When was  Caesar born or  How  many  feet  were  there  in  a 
stadium etc  a  clearcut answer ought to  be given just as  it 
is definitely true that the square on the hypotenuse is equal  to 
the sum of the squares on the other two sides of a  rightangled 
triangle  But the nature of a socalled  truth of that kind is  difcid
ferent from  the nature of philosophical  truths 

  As  regards historical  truthsto  mention  these  brieflycid

it win  be readily granted that so far as  their purely historical 
aspect is considered they are concerned with a particular existcid
ence with the contingent and arbitrary aspectsofa given concid
tent  which  have  no  necessity  But even  such  plain  truths  as 
thosejust illustrated are not without the movement of seWconcid
sciousness To cognize one of them a good deal of comparison 
is  called  for  books  must  be  consulted  in some  way  or  other 

PHENOMENOLOGY OF  SPIRIT 

inquiry has  to  be made  Even an immediate intuition is  held 
to have genuine value only when it is  cognized as  a fact  along 
with  its  reasons  although  it is  probably only  the  bare  result 
that we  are supposed  to  be concerned about 

  As for mathematical tru ths we should be even less inclined 
to regard  anyone as  a  geometer who knew  Euclids  theorems 
outwardly by rote without knowing their proofs without as  we 
might say to point the contrast knowing them inwardly  Simicid
larly if someone became aware  through measuring a number 
of rightangled  triangles  that  their sides  do  in fact  have  the 
wellknown  relation  to  one  another  we  should  consider  his 
mere awareness of the fact unsatisfactory Yet even in mathe  
Iatical cognition the essentiality of the proof does not have the 
significance and nature of being a  moment of the  result  itself 
when the latter is  reached  the demonstration is  over and  has 
disappeared I t is of course as a result that the theorem is  some  
thing seen  he true  but tbis added circumstance has no bearing 
onjtsconent but only ooits relation to the knowing Subject 
The movement of mathematical proof does not belong to the 
object butratheris an activity external to the matter in hand 
Thus the na ture of the rightangled triangle does not divide itself 
into parts in just the way set forth in the construction necessary 
for the proof of the proposition that expresses its ratio The way 
and the means  by which theresult is brought forth belong encid
tirely to the cognitive process  In philosophical cognition  too 
the  way in whicb  the  outer  existence  qua  existence  of a  thing 
comes a bou t is distinct from the way in which its essence or inner 
nature comes to he But to begin with philosophical cognition 
inchJdes  poth  existence and  essence   whereas  mathematical 
cognition sets fortb only the genesis of the existence  ie  the being 
of the  nature of the  thing  in  cognition  as  such  What is  more 
philosophical cognition also unites these two distinct processes 
Theinner comingtobe or genesis of substance is an unbroken 
transition ioto outer existence into beingforanother and concid
versely the genesis of existence is how existence is by itself taken 
back into essence  The  movement is  the  twofold  process  and 
the genesis  of the whole  in such wise  that each  side  simultacid
neously posits the other and each therefore  has  both perspeccid
tives  within itself  together they  thus  constitute  the  whole  by 

 
disolving  themselves  and  by  making  themselves  into  its 
moments 

PREFACE 

  In mathematical cognition insight is an activity external 
to  the thing it follows  that the true thing is  altered by it  The 
means employed construction and proof no doubt contain true 
propositions but it must none the less  be said  that the content 
is false  In the above example the triangle is dismembered and 
its parts consigned to other figures  whose origin is allowed  by 
the  construction  upon  the  triangle  Only  at  the  end  is  the 
triangle  we  are  actually dealing  with  reinstated  During  the 
procedure  it  was  lost  to  view  appearing  only  in  fragments 
belonging to other figuresHere then  we  see  the negativity 
of the content coming in as  well  this could just as  much have 
been called  a falsity of the content as is  the disappearance of 
supposedly fixed  conceptions in the  movement of the Notion 
  But what is reallydefective in this kind of cognition conm 
cerns  the  cognitive  process  itself  as  well  as  its  materiaL  As 
regards the former Ye qonot in theJirst place see avy necessity 
in the construction h necessitydoes notarise from the notion 
of the theorem it israJherimposed and the instruction to draw 
precisely  these  line  when  infinitly  many  others  could  be 
drawn must be  bliy obeyed without our knowing anything 
byQnd except that we believe that this will  he  to  the purpose 
inrryilg out the  proof  In  retrospect  this  expeqiency  also 
becomes eyicient but it is only an external expediencyhecause 
it hecomes evident qnlyafter the proof This proof il addition 
follows a path that begins somewhere or other without indicatcid
ing as yet what relationsuch a beginning will have tothe result 
that will emerge In its progress it takes upthese particulr detercid
minationsnd relationstnd lets others alone without its being 
immediately dear whfttthe controlling necessity is an external 
purpose governs  this  procedure 

  The evident character oftbis defective cognition of which 
matlemitics  is  prgud  and  on  which  it  plumes  itself before 
PQilosophy  rests  solely  on the poverty of its  purpose  and  the 
defectiveness of its stuff  and is  therefore  of a  kind  that philocid
sophy must spurn  Its purpose  or Notion  is magnitude  It is just 
this relatiQnship thats unessential lacking the Notion Accordcid
iJigly  this process of knowing proceeds on the surface does  not 
touch the thing itself  its essence or Notion and  therefore fails 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

to  comprehend it ie  in  terms  of its  NotionThe material 
regarding which mathematics provides such a  gratifying  treacid
sury of truths is  space  and the numerical unit  Space is  the  existcid
ence in which the Notion inscribes its differences as in an empty 
lifeless element in which they arejust as  inert and lifeless  The 
actual is not something spatial as it is regarded in mathematics 
with nonactual things like the objects of mathematics neither 
concrete senseintuition nor philosophy has  the least concern 
In a  nonactual element like  this  there  is  only  a  truth  of the 
same sort ie rigid dead propositions We can stop at anyone 
of them the next one starts afresh on its own account without 
the  first  having moved  itself on  to  the  next  and  without  any 
necessary  connection arising  through  the  nature  of the  thing 
itselfFurther  because  of this  principle  and  elementand 
herein consists the formalism of mathematical evidencethis 
kind of  knowing moves forward  along the line of equality  For 
what is lifeless since it does not move of itself  does not get as 
far as  the distinctions  of essence  as  far  as  essential opposition 
or inequality and therefore does not make the transition of one 
opposite  into  its  opposite  does  not  attain  to  qualitative 
immanent motion or self  movement  For it is only magnitude 
the  unessential  distinction that  mathematics  deals  with  It 
abstracts from the fact that itis the Notion which divides space 
into  its  dimensions  and  determines  the  connections  between 
and within them It does not for example consider the relationcid
ship of line to surface and when it compares the diameter of 
a  circle  with  its  circumference  it  runs  up  against  their  incid
commensurability ie a  relatiqnship of the Notion something 
infinite that eludes  mathematical determination 

  Nor does the immanent socalled pure mathematics set 
time qua  time over against space as  the second  material fbr  its 
consideration  Applied  mathematics  does  indeed  deal  with 
time as well as with motion and other concrete thins but the 
synthetic propositions ie propositions regarding relationships 
determined  by  their  Notion  it  takes  from  experience  and 
applies itsformulae only on these presuppositions The fact that 
thesocalled proofs of propositions such as those regarding the 
equilibrium of the lever  or the relation  of space  and  time  in 
the motion offaIling etc are often given and accepted as proofs 
itself only proves how great is  the need  of proof for  cognition 

PREFACE 

seeing that where nothing better is to be had cognition values 
even  the  hollow  semblance  of it  and  obtains  from  it  some 
measure osatisfaction A critique of these  proofs  would  be as 
noteworthy as it would be instructivel partly in order to strip 
mathematics of these fine feathers  partly in order to point out 
its limitations and thus show the necessity for a  different kind 
of knowledge 

As for time  which it is  to  be presumed would constitute  a 
the co un terpart of space the material of the other part of pure 
mathematics  it is  the  existent  Notion  itself  The  principle  of 
magnitude of difference not determined by the Notion and the 
principle of equality of abstract lifeless  unity cannot cope with 
that sheer unrest of life and its absolute distinction It is  therecid
fore only in a paralysed form viz as  the numerical unit  that this 
negativity becomes the second material of mathematical cognicid
tion which as an external activity reduces what is selfmoving 
to mere material so  as  to possess in it an indifferent  external 
lifeless  content 

  Philosophy  on the other hand  has  to do  not with uncid

essential determinations  but with  a  determination in so  far as 
it is essential  its dement and content is not the abstract or noncid
actual but the actual  that which posits itselfand is alive within 
itselfexistence within its own Notion It is the process which 
begets  and  traverses its  own moments  and  this  whole  movecid
mentconstitutes what is positive in it and its truth This truth 
therefore includes the negative also  what would  be called  the 
false ifit could be regarded as something from which one might 
abstract  The  evanescent  itself  must  on  the  contrary  be 
regarded as essential  not as  something fixed  cut off from  the 
Trueand left lying who knows where outside it anymore than 
the True is  to be regarded as something on the other side posicid
tive and dead Appearance is the arising and passing away that 
does not itself arise and pass away but is  in itself ie subsists 
in trinsically  and constitutes the actuali ty and the movement 
of the  life  of truth  The True is  thus  the  BacchanaHan  revel

  It might seem necessary at the outset to say more about 
the  method of this  movement  Le  of Science  But its  Notion  is 
already to be found in what has been said and its proper exposi u 
tion belongs to Logic  or rather it is  Logie  For the method is 
nothing but the structure set forth  in its  pure essentiality  We 
should  realize  however  that  the  system  of ideas  concerning 
philosophical method is  yet  another set of current beliefs  that 
belongs  to  a  bygone culture  If this  comment sounds  boastful 
or revolutionary  and I  am far from  adopting such a  tonecid
it should be noted  that current opinion itself has already come 
to  view  the  scientific  regime  bequeathed  by  mathematics  as 
quite o ldfa sh io nedwith its explanations divisions axioms sets 
of theorems its proofs principles deductions  and conclusions 
from them EvenJf its unfitness is  not clearly understood little 
or no  use  is  any longer  made of it  and  though  not actually 
condemned outright no one likes it very much And we should 
be sufficiently prejudiced in favour of what is excellent to supcid
pose  that it will  be  put to  usc  and  will  find  acceptance  But 
it is  not difficult to see  that the way of asserting a  proposition 
adducing reasons for itland in the same way refuting its oppocid
site by reasons is not theform in which truth can appear Truth 
is  its own  selfmovement  whereas  the  method just described 
is  the mode of cognition that remains eternal  to its  material 
Hence itis peculiar to mathematics  and  must he  left  to  that 
science wkh as we have noted  has for its principle the relacid
tionship of magnitude a relationship alien to  the  Notion  and 
for  its  material dead  space and  the equally lifeless  numerical 
unit This method too ina looser form ie more blended with 
thearhitraryand the accidental may retain its place as in concid
versation or in a piece of historical instruction designed rather 
to satisfy curiosity than to produce knowledge  which is  about 
what a preface amounts to  In ordinary life  consciousness  has 
for  its  content  items  of  information  experiences  concrete 

PREFACE 

objects of sense  thoughts  basic principlesanything will  do 
as  a  content  as  long as  it is  ready  to  hand or is  accepted  as 
a  fixed  and stable  being  or  essence  Sometimes  consciousness 
follows  where  this  leads  sometimes  it  breaks  the  chain  and 
deals arbitrarily with its content behaving as  if it were deter a 
mining and manipulating it from outside  It refers  the content 
back  to  some  certainty or other  even if only  to  the  sensation 
of the moment and conviction is satisfied when a famiJiar rest a 
ingplace is  reached 

  But we have already pointed out that once the necessity 
of the Notion has banished the slipshod style of conversational 
discussion  and  along with  it the  pedantry  and  pomposity  of 
science they are not to be replaced by the nonmethod of precid
sentiment and inspiration or by the arbitrariness of prophetic 
utterance both of which despise not only scientific pomposity 
but scientific procedure of all  kinds 

  Of course the triadicform must not be regarded as scien  
tific  when  it is  reduced  to  a  lifeless  schema  a  mere  shadow 
and  when  scientific  organization  is  degraded  into  a  table  of 
terms  Kant rediscovered  this  triadic form  by instinct  but in 
his  work it was  still lifeless  and  uncomprehended since  then 
it  has  however  been  raised  to  its  absolute  significance  and 
with it the  true  form  in  its  true  content  has  been  presented 
so that the Notion of Science has emerged  This formalism  of 
which we  have  already spoken  generally  and  whose  style  we 
wish here to describe in more detail imagines that it has com  
prehended and expressed  the  nature and  life  of a  form  when 
it has endowed it with  some  determination  of the  schema  as 
a predicate Thepredicate may  be  subjectivity or objectivity 
Of say  magnetism electricity  etc  contraction or expansion 
east  or west  and  the like  Such  predicates  can  bemultiplied 
to  infinity  since  in  this  way  each  determination  or  form  can 
again  be  used  as  a  form  or  moment  in  the  case  of an  other 
and each can gratefully perform the same service for  an other 
In  this  sort of circle of reciprocity  one  never  learns  what  the 
thing itself is  nor what the one or the  other is  In such  a  pro  
cedure sometimes determinations of sense are picked up from 
everyday intuition  and  they  are supposed  of course  to  mean 
something different from  what they say sometimes  what is  in 
itself meaningful eg pure determinations of thought like sub

selfmoving soul of the  realized  content  The  movement  of a 
being that immediately is consists partly in becoming an other 
than  itself  and  thus  becoming  its  own  immanent  content 
partly in  taking  back into itself this  unfding  of its  content 
or this existence of it ie  in  making itself into a  moment and 
simplifying  itself into  something  determinate  In  the  former 
movement negativity is  the differentiating and positing of existcid
ence  in this return into selt it is  the becoming of the determinate 
simplicity  It is in this way that the content shows that its detercid
minateness is  not received from something else  nor externally 
attached to it but that it determines itself  and ranges itself as 
a moment having its own place in the whole The Understandcid
ing in its pigeonholing process keeps the necessity and Notion 
of the  content  to  itselfall  that  constitutes  the  concreteness 
the  actuality  the  living  movement  of  the  reality  which  it 
arranges  Or rather it does  not keep this  to itself since it does 
not recognize it for  iflt had this insight  it would surely give 
some sign of it  It does not even recognize  the  need for it  else 
it would drop its  schematizing  or at least  realize  that  it can

Even when the specific determinatenessccSayone like Mag

standing degrades it into something lifeless merely predicating 
it  of another  existent  thing  rather  than  cognizing  it  as  the

way of generating and expressing itselfin that thing The formal 
Understanding leaves it to others to add this  principal feature 
Instead of entering into the immanent content of the thing  it 
is forever surveying the whole and standing above the particucid

all  Scientific  cognition  on  the  contrary  demands  surrender 
to  the  life  of the  object  Of  what amounts  to  the  same  thing

in its object scientific cognition forgets  about that general surcid

and  has  reduced  itself to  one  aspect  of its  own  existence  and

simple  selfsurveying  whole  itself emerges from  the wealth in 
which  its  reflection seemed  to  be  lost 

talk  about  the  identity  of  Thought  and 

  In general because as  we  put it above  substance is  in 
itself or implicitly Subject all content is  its own reflection into 
itself  The subsistence  or substance  of anything  that  exists  is 
its selfidentity for a failure of selfidentity would be its dissolucid
tion Selfidentity however is pure abstraction but this is thinkcid
ing  When I say quality I  am saying simple determinateness 
ids by quality that one existence is distinguished from another 
or is an existence it is for itself or it subsists through this simple 
oneness with itself  But it is  thereby essentially a  thought  Comcid
prehended in this  is  the fact  that Being  is  Thought  and  this 
is the source of that insight which usually eludes the usual supercid
ficial  begrijfios 
BeingNow since the subsistence of an existent thing is a selfcid
identity or pure abstraction it is  the abstraction of itself from 
itself or it is  itself its  lack of self  identity and its  dissolutioncid
its own inwardness and withdrawal intoitselfits own becomcid
ing Because this is the nature of what is and in sofar as what 
is  has  this  natyre  for  our  knowing  this  knowing  is  not  an 
activity that deals  with the content as  something alien  is  not 
a reflectioniutoitselfaway from the content Science is not that 
idealim  which  replaced  the  dogmatism  of assertion  with  a 
dogmatism of assurance or a dogmatism of selfcertainty On 
the contrary since  our knowing sees  the  contentreturn into 
its own inwardness  its  activity is  totally absorbed  in the concid
tent for it is  the immanent self of the content yet it has at the 
same time returned in to itself for it is pure selfiden tity in othercid
ness  Thus it is  the  cunning  which  while  seeming  to  abstain 
from activity looks on and watches how determinateness with 
its concrete life just where it fandes it is  pursuing its own selfcid
preservation  and particular interest  is  in fact  doing  the  very 
opposite is  an activity that results  in  its  own dissolution  and 
makes  itself a  moment of the  whole

to  the  determination  of  substance  as  being  Existence  is 
Quality  selfidentical  determinateness  or  determinate  simcid
plicity determinate thought this is the Understanding of existcid
ence  ie  the  nature  of existence  from  the  standpoint  of the 
Understanding  Hence  it is  Jlous  as  Anaxagoras first  recogcid
nized  the  essence  of things  to  be  Those  who  came  after  him 
grasped the nature of existence more definitely as  Eidos or Idea 
determinate  Universality  Species  or  Kind  It might  seem as 
if the term Species or Kind is  too commonplace too inadequate 
for Ideas such as  the Beautiful  the Holy and the Eternal that 
are currently in fashion  But as  a  matter of fact  Idea expresses 
neither more nor less  than Species  or Kind  But nowadays an 
expression which exactly designates a  Notion is  often spurned 
in favour of one which ifonly because it is offoreign extraction 
shrouds the Notion in a  fog  and  hence sounds  more edifying  

Precisely because existence is defined as Species it is a simple 

thought  NallS  simplicity is substance  On account of its  simcid
plici ty or seWiden tily it appears  fixed  and  enduring  But this 
seUidentity is  no less  negativity  therefore  its  fixed  existence 
passes  over into its  dissolution  The determinateness  seems  a 
first  to be due entirely to the fact  that it is  related  to  an  other 
and its  movementseems imposed on it by an alien  power  but 
having its otherness within itself  and being seWmoving is just 
what isinvolved in the simplicity of thinking itself for this simple 
thinking is  the selfmoving and selfdifferentiating  thought  it 
is  its  own  inwardness  it is  the  pure  Notion  Thus  COmmon 
understanding  too  is  a  becoming  and  as  this  becoming  it 
is  reasonableness 

  It is  in  this  nature of what is  to  be in its  being its  own 
Notion that logical necessity in general consists This alone is  the 
rational element and the rhythm of the organic whole it is  as 
much knowledge of the content as  the content is  the Notion and 
essencein other words  it alone  is  speculative  philosophy  The 
selfmoving  concrete  shape  makes  itself into  a  simple  detercid
minateness in so doing it raises itself to logical form  and exists 
in its essentiality its  concrete existence is just this  movement 
and is directly a  logical existence  It is  for this  reason unnecescid
sary  to clothe  the  content in an external  logical  formalism

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

to  give  up  this  freedom  and  instead  of being  the  arbitrarily 
moving principle of the content to sink this freedom in the concid
tent  letting it  move  spontaneously  of its  own  nature  by  the 
selfas its own self and then to contemplate this movement This 
refusal  to  intrude  into  the  immanent  rhythm  of the Notion 
either arbitrarily or with wisdom obtained from elsewhere concid
stitutes  a  restraint  which  is  itself an  essential  moment  of the 
Notion 

  There are two aspects of the procedure of argumentation 
to  which  speculative  hegreifende  thinking  is  opposed  and 
which call for further notice First such reasoning adopts a negacid
tive attitude towards the content it apprehends it knows  how 
to  refute  it  and  destroy  it  That something  is  not  the  case  is 
a  merely  negative insight  a  dead  end which  does  not lead to 
a  new  conten t  beyond itself  In order to  have a  con ten t  once 
again  something  new  must  be  taken  over  from  elsewhere 
Argumentation is  reflection  into  the  empty  the vanity  of 
its own knowingThis vanity however expresses not only the 
vanity of this content  but also the futility of this insight itself 
for this insightis the negative that fails to Beethe positive within 
itself  Because this  reflection does notget its  very negativity as 
its  content  it is  never at the heart of the  matter  hut always 
heyond itFor this reason it imagines  that by establishing the 
void it is  always  ahead of any insight  rich  in  content  On the 
other hand  in speculative  begreifenden  thinking  as  we  have 
already shown the negative  belongs  to  the  content itself  and 
is the positive both as the immanent movement and determination 
of the  content  and as  the whole  of this  process  Looked at as 
a result what emerges from  this  process is  the determinate  negacid
tive  which is  consequently a positive  content as  well 

  But in view of the fact that such thinking has a  content 
whether of picturethoughts or abstract thoughts    a  mixture 
of both argumentation has another side which makes comprecid
hension difficult for it The remarkable nature of this other side 
is  closely linked with the abovementioned essence of the Idea 
or rather itexpresses the Idea in the way that it appears as  the 
movement which is  thinking apprehension  For whereas in its 
negative behaviour which we have just discussed ratiocinative 
thinking is  itself the  self into which  the  content returns  in  its 
positive  cognition  on  the  other  hand  the  self is  a  Suhject  to 

PREFACE 

 
which  the content is  related  as  Accident  and  Predicate  This 
Subject constitutes the basis  to  which  the  content is  attached 
and upon which the movement runs  back and forth  Specula 
tive begreifendes  thinking behaves in a different way Since the 
Notion is the objectss own self which presents itself as  the eamcid
ingtobe of the object it is  not a passive Subject inertly supporting 
the  Accidents  it  is  on  the  contrary  the  selfmoving  Notion 
which  takes  its  determinations  back into  itself  In  this  movecid
ment the passive  Subject itself perishes  it enters into  the  difcid
ferences  and the content and constitutes the determinateness 
ie  the  differentiated  content  and  its  movement  instead  of 
remaining inertly over against it The solid ground which argucid
mentation  has  in  the  passive  Subject is  therefore shaken  and 
only this movement itself becomes the object The Subject that 
fills  its  content ceases  to  g heyond  it  and  cannot  have  any 
further Predicates or accidental properties Conversely the discid
persion of the content is thereby bound together under the self 
it is not the universal which free from the Subject could belong 
to several others Thus the content is inJact no longer aPredicid
cate of the Subject  but is  the Substance  the essence  and  the 
Notion  of what  is  under  discussion  Picturethinking  whose 
nature  it is  to  run  through  the  Accidents  or  Predicates  and 
w hich  beca use  they  are  nothing  more  than  Predicates  and 
Accidents rightly goes beyond them is checked in its  progress 
since  that which has  the form  of a  Predicate in a  proposition 
is  the Substance itself  Itsuffers as we might pULit  a countercid
thrust  Starting from  the  Subject  as  though  this  Were  a  percid
manent grounclit finds  that since the  Predicate is  really  the 
Substance the Subject has passed over into the Predicate and 
by this very fact  has beensuhlated and since in this way what 
seems to be the Predicate has become the whole and the indecid
pendent mass  thinking  cannot  roam  at will  hut is  impeded 
by  this  weight 

Usually  the Subject is  first  made  the  basis as  the  objective 
fixedsdf  thence  the  necessary  movement to  the  multiplicity 
of determinations  or  Predicates  proceeds  Here  that Subject 
is replaced by the knowing I itself which links the Predicates 
with  the  Subject  holding  them  But  since  that first  Subject 
enters into the determinations themselves and is their sou the 
second Subject viz  the knowing I still finds  in the  Predicate

what it thought it had  finished with and got  away from  and 
from which it hoped to return into itself and instead of being 
able to function as  the determining agent in the movement of 
predication arguing back and forth  whether to attach  this  or 
that Predicate it is really still occupied with the self of the concid
tent  having to remain  associated  with it instead of being for 
itself 

  Formally what has been said can be expressed thus  the 
general nature of the judgement or proposition which involves 
the distinction of Subject and Predicate is destroyed by the specid
culative proposition and the proposition of identity which the 
former  becomes  contains  the  counterthrust against that sub  
jectpredicate relationshipThis conflict between the general 
form of a proposition and the unity of the Notion which destroys 
it is similar to the conflict that occurs in rhythm between metre 
and accent  Rhythm results  from  the  floating  centre  and  the 
unification of the two So too in the philosophical proposition 
the identification of Subject and Predicate is not meant to decid
stroythe difference between them which the form  of the procid
position expresses  their unity  rather  is  meant  to  emerge  as 
a  harmony  The form  of the  proposition is  the appearance of 
the determinate sense or the accent that distinguishes its fulfil  
ment but that the predicate expresses the Substance and that 
the SubJect itselffalls into the universal this is the unity in which 
the accent dies  away 

 

  To illustrate what has been said in the proposition God 

is being the Predicate is being  it has the significance of somecid
thing substantial in which  the  Subject  is  dissolved  Being  is 
here  meant  to  be  not  a  Predicate  but rather  the  essence  it 
seems conseq uendy that God ceases  to be what he is  from his 
position in the proposition viz  a fixed Subject  Here thinking 
instead of making progress in the transition from Subject to Precid
dicate in reali ty feels itself checked by the loss of the Bu bject and 
missing it is  thrown back on to the thought of the Subject Or 
since  the  Predicate  itself has  been  expressed  as  a  Subject  as 
the  being or essence  which  exhausts  the  nature  of the  Subject 
thinking finds  the Subject immediately in  the  Predicate  and 
now  having  returned  into  itself in  the  Predicate  instead  of 
being in a position where it has freedom for argument it is  still 
absorbed in the  content or at least is  faced  with the demand 

PREFACE 

 
that it should  be  Similarly  too  when one says  the actual  is 
the  univrsal the actual as  subject disappears in its  predicate 
The uniyersal is  not meant to  have  merely  the significance  of 
a predicate as  if the proposition asserted  only that the  actual 
is  universal on the contrary the universal is  meant to express 
the  essence  of the  actualThinking  therefore  loses  the  firm 
objective basis it had in  the subject when  in the predicate  it 
is  thrown back on  to  the  subject  and when in  the  predicate 
it does not return into itself but into the subject of the content 
  This abnormal inhibition of thought is  in large measure 
the  source  of the  complaints regarding the  unintelligibility of 
philosophical wTitings from individuals who otherwise  possess 
the educational requirements for understanding them Here we 
see  the reason behind one particular complaint so  often  made 
against them that so much has to be read over and over before 
it can be understooda complaint whose burden is  presumed 
to be quite outrageous and if justified to admit of no defence 
Itis clear from the above what this amounts to The philosophi 
cal  proposition since it is  a  proposition  leads  One  to  believe 
that the usual subJectpredicate relation obtains as wen as  the 
usual attitude towards knowing  But the philosophical content 
destroys tfiisattitudeand this opinion We learn by experience 
that we meant something other than we  meant  to  mean  and 
this correction afour meaning compels our knowing to go back 
to  the proposition  and understand it in some other way 

  One difficulty which should be avoided comes from mixcid

ing up the speculative with  the  ratiocinative methods  so  that 
what is  said of the Subject at one  time signifies Its  Notion  at 
another time merely its  Predicate or accidental property  The 
one method interferes with the other and only a  philosophical 
exposition  that rigidly excludes  the  usual  way  of relating  the 
parts  of a  proposition  could  achieve  the goal of plasticity 

 As a matter offact nonspeculative thinking also has its 

vaHdrights which are disregarded in the speculative way ofstatcid
inga proposition  The sublation of the form  of the proposition 
must not happen only in an immediate manner through the mere 
content of the proposition On the contrary this opposite movecid
ment must find  explicit expression  it must not just be  the incid
ward  inhibition mentioned  abovt  This  return  of the  Notion 
into itself must be set forth  This  movement  which  constitutes 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

 
what formerly the proof was supposed to accomplish is the diacid
lectical movement of the proposition itself This alone is  the specid
culative in  act  and only  the expression  of this  moveent is  a 
speculative exposjtion As a proposition the speculative is  only 
the  internal  inhibition  and  the  nonexistential  return  of  the 
essence into itself Hence we often find philosophical expositions 
referring us  to  this  inner intuition and in  this  way  they evade 
the  systematic  exposition  of the  dialectical  movement  of the 
proposition which we have demandedThe proposition should 
express  what  the  True is  but essentially  the  True  is  Subject 
As  such it is  merely the dialectical movement  this course  that 
generates itself  going forth  from  and  returning  to  itself  In 
nonspeculative  cognition  proof  constitutes 
this  side  of 
expressed inwardness But once the dialectic has been separated 
from proof the notion of philosophical demonstration has heen 
lost 

  Here we should bear in mind that the dialectical movecid
mentlikewisehas propositions for its parts or elements the difficid
culty just indicated seems therefore  to recur perpetually and 
to he inherent in  the  very nature of philosophical  exposition 
This is ke what happens in ordinary proof where the reasons 
given  are  themselves in need of further reasons and sa  on  ad 
infinitum  This pattern of giving reasons  and stating conditions 
belongs to that method of proof which differs from the dialecticid
cal movement and belongs therefore to external cognition As 
regards the dialectical  movement itself  its  element is  the one 
Notion it thus has a  content which is  in its  own self  Subject 
through and through Thus no content occurs whichfunctions 
as an underlying subject  nor receives  its  meaning as  a  predicid
cate the proposition as it stands is  merely an empty form 

Apart from the self that is sensuously intuited orfepresented 

it is  above all  the name as  name that designates the pure Subcid
ject the empty unit without thoughtcontent For this  reason 
it may be expedient eg  to avoid  the  name  God since  this 
word is  not immediately also  a  Notion but rather the  proper 
name the fixed point ofrest of the underlyingSubject whereas 
on the other hand eg  Being or the One Singularity the 
Subject etc themselves at once suggest concepts  Even if spe 
culative truths are affirmed of this  subject  their content lacks 
the immanent Notion because it is  present merely in the form 

PREFACE 

of a  passive  subject  with  the  result  that  such  truths  readily 
assume  the form of mere  edification  From  this  side  too  the 
habit of expressing  the speculative  predicate in the form  of a 
proposition and not as Notion and essence  creates a difficulty 
that can  be  increased or diminished  through  the very way in 
which philosophy is  expounded  In  keeping  with  our  insight 
into the nature of speculation  the exposition should  preserve 
the dialectical form and should admit nothing except in so far 
as  it  is  comprehended  in  terms  of the  Notion  and  is  the 
Notion 

  The study of philosophy is as much hindered by the concid
ceit that will not argue as it is  by the argumentative approach 
This  concit relies  on truths which are  taken for  granted and 
which it sees  no need  to  reexamine  it just lays  them  down 
and believes it is entitled to assert them as well as  to judge and 
pass sentence by appealing to them In view of this it is  especicid
ally  necessary  that  philosophizing  should  again  be  made  a 
serious business In the case of all other sciences arts skins and 
crafts everyone is  convinced that a complex and laborious procid
gramme of learning and practice is  necessary for  competence 
Yet whenitcomes tophilosophy there seems to be a currently 
prevailing prejudice to  the  effect  that  although not everyone 
who has  eyes  and fingers  and  is  given  leather  and  last  is  at 
once in a position to make shoes  everyone nevertheless imme 
diatey understilnds how to philosophize and how to evaluate 
philosophy since  he  possesses  the criterion for  doing so  in his 
natural  reasooas  if he did not  likewise  possess  the  measure 
for  a  shoe  in  his  own  foot  I t  seems  that  philosophical  comcid
petence  consists  precisely  in  an  absence  of information  and 
study  as  though philosophy left off where  they began  Philocid
sophy is  frequently taken to be a  purely fornlal  kind of knowcid
ledge  voidof content  and  the insight  is  sadly  lacking  that 
whatever trutv there  may be in the content of any  discipline 
or science itean only deserve the name if sueh truth has been 
engendered by philosophy  Let the other sciences try  to argue 
as  much as  they like without philosophywithout it they  can 
have in  them neither life  Spirit  nor truth 

  In place of the long process  of culture  towards genuine 
philosophy amovemen t as rich as it is profound through w hieh 
Spirit achieves  knowledge  we  are  offered as  quite equivalent 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

either direct  revelations  from  heaven  or  the  sound  common 
sense that has never laboured over or informed itselfregarding 
other knowledge  or genuine  philosophy  and  we  are  assured 
that these are quite as  good substitutes  as  some  claim chicory 
is  for  coffee  It is  not a  pleasant experience  to  see  ignorance 
and  a  crudity  without  form  or  taste  which  cannot  focus  its 
thought on a single abstract proposition still less on a connected 
chain  of  them  claiming  at  one  moment  to  be  freedom  of 
thought  and  toleration  and  at  the  next  to  be  even  genius 
Genius we all know was once all  the rage in poetry as  it now 
is  in  philosophy  but when its  productions  made sense  at all 
such genius begat only trite prose instead of poetry or getting 
beyond that only crazy rhetoric So nowadays philosophizing 
by the light of nature which regards itself as  too good for  the 
Notion and as being an intuitive and poetic thinking in virtue 
of this deficiency  brings to  market the arbitrary combinations 
of  an  imagination  that  has  only  been  disorganized  by  its 
thoughts  an  imagery  that  is  neither  fish  nor  flesh  neither 
poetry nor philosophy 

  On the other hand when philosophizing by the light of 
natureflows along the more evenCOUfse of sound commonsense 
it offers at its very best only a  rhetoric of trivial truths  And if 
reproached with the insignificance of these truths it assures us 
in  reply that their  meaning and fulfilment  reside  in its  heart 
and  must surely  be  present in  the  hearts  of others  too  since 
it reckons  to have said the last word once the innocence of the 
heart  the  purity  of  conscience  and  such  like  have  been 
mentioned  These are  ultimate  truths  to  which  no  exception 
can  be  taken  and  beyond  which  nQthing  more  can  be 
demanded  It is just the  point  however  that the best should 
not  remain  in  the  recesses  of what  is  inner  but  should  be 
brought out of these depths into the light of day  But it would 
be better by far to spare oneself the effort of bringing forth  ulticid
mate truths ofthatkind for they have longsinee been available 
in catechisms or in popular sayings  etcIt is  not difficult  to 
grasp such vague and misleading truths  or even to show  that 
the mind in believing them is also aware of their very opposite 
When it labours  to extricate itself from  the  bewilderment this 
sets up it falls into fresh contradictions and may very well burst 
out with the assertion  that the question  is  settled  that so  and 

PREFACE 

 
so  is  the  truth  and  that  the  other views  are  sophistries  For 
sophistry is  a  slogan used by ordinary common sense  against 
educated  reason just as  the  expression  visionary  dreaming 
sums up once and for all what philosophy means to those who 
are ignorant ofitSince the man of common sense makes his 
appeal to feeling  to an oracle  within  his  breast  he  is  finished 
and  done  with  anyone  who  does  not  agree  he  Dnly  has  to 
explain  that he  has  nothing  more  to say  to  anyone  who  does 
not  find  and  feel  the  same  in  himself  In  other  words  he 
tramples underfoot the roots of humanity  For it is  the  nature 
of humanity to press onward to agreement with others human 
nature only really exists  in  an achieved  community of minds 
The antihuman the merely animal consists in staying within 
the  sphere of feeling  and  being able  to  communicate only at 
that level 

  Should anyone ask for  a  royal  road  to  Science  there is 
no more easygoing way than to rely on sound common sense 
and for  the rest in order to keep  up with  the  times  and with 
advances in philosophy to read reviews of philosophical works 
perhaps even to read  their prefaces  and first paragraphs  For 
these  preliminary  pages give  the  general  principles  on  which 
everything turns and the reviews as well as providing historical 
accounts  also  provide  the  critical  appraisal  which  being  a 
judgement stands high above the work judged This common 
road  can be  taken in casual  dress  but the  high  sense  for  the 
Eternal  the  Holy  the  Infinite strides along in  the  robes  of a 
high  priest  on a  road  that  is  from  the  first  no  road  but  has 
immediate being as  its centre the genius  Df profound original 
ideas and lofty flashes  of inspiration  But just as  profundity of 
this  kind still  does  not  reveal  the source of essential being  so 
too  these skyrockets of inspiration are not yet  the  empyrean 
True thoughts and scientific insight are only to be won through 
the labour of the Notion Only the Notion can produce the unicid
versality of knowledge which is neither common vagueness nor 
the  inadequacy  of ordinary  common  sense  but  a  fully  de 
veoped  perfected  cognition  not the uncommon universality 
of a  reason whose  talents  have  been ruined by indolence and 
the  conceit  of  genius  but  a  truth  ripened  to  its  preperly 
matured form so  as  to  be capable of being the  property of all 
selfconscious  Reason 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

 I  Since I  hold  that Science  exists  solely in  the selfmove  
ment of the Notion and since  my view  differs  from  and  is  in 
fact wholly opposed to current ideas regarding the nature and 
form of truth both those referred to above and other peripheral 
aspects of them it seems  that any attempt to expound  the syscid
tem of Science from  this  point of view is  unlikely to be favourcid
ably received  In the meantime  I  can  bear in  mind  that if at 
times  the excellence of Platos philosophy has  been  held  to  He 
in his scientifically valueless myths there have also  been times 
even called times of ecstatic dreaming when Aristotles philocid
sophy was esteemed for its speculative depth  and  Platos  Parcid
menides  surely the greatest artistic achievement of the  ancient 
dialectic  was  regarded  as  the  true  disclosure  and  positive 
explession  of  the  divine  life  and  times  when  despite  the 
obscurity generated by ecstasy  this  misunderstood ecstasy was 
in  fact  supposed  to  be  nothing  else  than  the  pure  Notion 
Furthermore what really is  excellent in  the philosophy of our 
time takes its value to lie in its scientific quality and even though 
others  take  a  different  view  it is  in  fact  only  in  virtue  of its 
scientific character that it exerts  any influence  Hence  I  may 
hope too that this attempt to vindicate Science for the Notion 
and  to  expound it in  this  its  proper  element  will  succeed  in 
winning acceptance through the inner truth ofthesubjecbmatcid
ter We must hold to the conviction thatit is  the nature of truth 
to prevail when its time has come and that it appears only when 
this  time has come and therefore  never appears  prematurely 
nor finds  a  public not ripe  to  receive  it  also  we  must  accept 
thatthe individual needs that this should be so in order to verify 
what is as yet a matter for himself alone and to experience the 
conviction which in the first place belongs only to a  particular 
individual  as  something  universally  held  But  in  this  con 
nection the public must often be distinguished from  those who 
pose as its representatives and spokesmen  In many respects the 
attitude of the public is  quite different from  even contrary to 
that of these spokesmen  Whereas  the  public is  inclined  goodcid
naturedly to  blame itself when a  philosophical work makes  no 
appeal to it these others certain of their own competence put 
all  the  blame on the author  The effect  of such  a  work  on  the 

I  This was what the English Enlightment called enthusiasm but the word has no relik 
gious  overtones  now 

PREFACE 

 
public is more noiseless than the action of these dead men when 
they bury their dead  The general level of insight now  is  altocid
gether more educated its curiosity more awake and its judgecid
ment  more  swiftly  reached so  that the  feet  of those  who  will 
carry you out are  already at the door  But from  this  we  must 
often  distinguish  the  more  gradual  effect  which  corrects  the 
attention  extorted  by  imposing  assurances  and  corrects  too 
contemptuous censure and gives some writers an audience only 
after a  time  while others after a  time  have  no  audience  left 
  For the  rest  at  a  time  when  the  universality  of Spirit 
has gathered such strength and the singular detail as is fitting 
has  become  correspondingly  less  importan t  when  too  that 
universal aspect claims and holdson to the whole range of the 
wealth it has  developed  the share in  the  total  work  of Spirit 
which falls  to  the  individual can only  be  very  small  Because 
of this  the individual must all  the more forget  himself  as  the 
nature of Science implies and requires Of course he must make 
of himself and achieve what he can but less  must be demanded 
of him just as  he in  turn can expect less  of himself  and may 
demand less  for  himself 

INTRODUCTION 

  It is  a  natural assumption that in philosophy beforeVe 
start  to  deal  with  its  proper  subjectmatter  viz  the  actual 
cognition of what truly is one must first of all come to an under 
standing about cognition which is regarded either as the instrucid
ment  to  get hold  of the  Absolute  or  as  the  medium  through 
which  one  discovers  it  A  certain  uneasiness  seems  justified 
partly becase there are different  types  of cognition  and  one 
of  them  might  be  more  appropriate  than  another  for  the 
attainment of ths goal  so  that  we  could  make  a  bad  choice 
of means  and partly because cognition is a faculty ofa definite 
kind and scope and thus without a  more precise definition of 
its  nature and limits  we  might  grasp  clouds  of error instead 
of the heaven of truth This feeling of uneasiness is surely bound 
to  be  transformed  into  the  conviction  that  the  whole  project 
of securing for  consciousness  through  cognition what exists  in 
itselfis absurd and that there is a boundary between cognition 
and the Absolute that completely separates them For if cogni 
tion  is  the instrument for  getting hold  of absolute  being  it  is 
obvious that the use of an instrument on a  thing certainly does 
not let it be what it is  for  itself  but rather sets  out  to  reshape 
and ater it If on the other hand cognition is not an instrument 
of our activity but a more or less passive medium through which 
the light of truth reaches  us  then again we  do not receive  the 
truth as  it is  in  itself  but only as  it exists  through  and  in  this 
medium  Either way we  employ a  means  which  immediately 
brings  about  the  opposite  of its  own  end  or  rather  what  is 
really absurd is  that we  should make use  of a  means at all 

It would seem  to  be sure  that this  evil  could  be remedied 
through an acquaintance with the way in which the  instrument 
works for  this  would  enable  us  to  eliminate  from  the  reprecid
sentation  of the  Absolute  which  we  have  gained  through  it 
whatever is  due  to  the  instrument  and  thus  get  the  truth  in 
its  purity But this  improvement  would  in fact  only  bring us 
back to where we  were  before  If we  remove from  a  reshaped 
thing what the instrument has done to it  then the  thinghere 

INTRODUCTION 

 
the  Absolutebecomes for  us  exactly what it was  before  this 
accordingly  superfluous  effort  On  the  other  hand  if  the 
Absolute is supposed merely to be brought nearer to us  through 
this instrument without anything in it being altered like a bird 
caught by a limetwig it would surely laugh our little  ruse  to 
scorn  if it were  not  with  us  in  and  for  itself  all  along  and 
of its own volition  For a  ruse  is just what cognition would  be 
in such a  case  since  it would  with its  manifold  exertions  be 
giving  itself the  air  of doing  something  quite  different  from 
creating a  merely immediate and  therefore effortless  relationcid
ship  Or if by  testing  cognition  which  we  conceive  of as  a 
medium we get to know the law ofits refraction it is  again useless 
to subtract this from the end result  For it is  not the refraction 
of the ray  but the  ray itself whereby  truth reaches  us  that is 
cognition and if this were removed all that would be indicated 
would  be  a  pure direction  or a  blank space 

  Meanwhile if the fear of faIling into error sets  up a miscid

trust of Science which in the absence  of such scruples  gets  on 
with the work itselfand actually cognizes something it is  hard 
to  see  why  we  should  not  turn  round  and  mistrust  this  very 
mistrust  Should we not be  concerned as  to  whether  thi fear 
of error is not just the error itself Indeed this fear takes somecid
thinga great deal in factfor granted  as  truth  supporting 
its scruples and inferences on what is itselfin need of prior scrucid
tiny to see ifit is true To be specific ittakes for granted certain 
ideas  about  cognition  as  an  instrument  and  as  a  medium  and 
assumes that there is a  dijference between ourselves and this cognition 
Above all it presupposes that the Absolute stands  on one side 
and  cognition on  the  other  independent and  separated  from 
it and yet is  something real or in other words it presupposes 
that cognition which  since  it is  excluded from  the  Absolute 
is  surely  outside  of the  truth  as  well j  is  nevertheless  true  an 
assumption whereby what calls itselffear of error reveals  itself 
rather as  fear  of the  truth 

  This  conclusion  stems  from  the  fact  that  the  Absolute 
alone is  true  or the  truth alone  is  absolute  One may set  this 
aside  on  the grounds  that there  is  a  type  of cognition which 
though it does  not cognize  the Absolute  as  Science  aims  to  is 
still true and that cognition in general  though it be incapable 
of grasping the Absolute is still capable of grasping other kinds 

 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF SPIRIT 

of truth  But we  gradually  come  to  see  that  this  kind  of talk 
which  goes  back  and  forth  only  leads  to  a  hazy  distinction 
between an absolute  truth and some  other kind of truth  and 
that words like absolute cognition etc  presuppose a  meancid
ing which has  yet  to  be ascertained 

  Instead of troubling ourselves with such useless ideas and 
locutions about cognition as  an instrument for getting hold of 
the  Absolute  or  as  a medium  through  which  we  view  the 
truth relationships which surely in the end are what all these 
ideas of a cognition cut offfrom the Absolute  and an Absolute 
separated from  cognition  amount  to  instead  of putting  up 
with excuses which create the incapacity of Science by assuming 
relationshi ps  of this kind in order to be exempt from  the hard 
work of Science while at the same time  giving  the impression 
of working  seriously  and  zealously  instead  of bothering  to 
refute all these ideas we could reject them out of hand as advencid
titious and arbitrary and the words associated with  them like 
absolute cognition objective and subjective  and count  
less  others whose meaningis assumed to be generally familiar 
could even be regarded as so much deception  For to  give the 
impression that their meaning is  generally well known or that 
their Notion is  comprehended looks  more like  an attempt  to 
avoid  the  main  problem  which  is  precisely  to  provide  this 
Notion  We could with better justification simply spare ourcid
selves the trouble of paying any attention whatever to suchideas 
and locutions for  they are intended to ward off Science itself 
and constitute merely an empty appearance of knowing which 
vanishes immediately as  sOon  as  Science  comes  on  the scene 
But Science  just  because  it comes  on  the  scene  is  itself an 
appearance in coming on the scene it is  not yet Science in its 
developed and unfolded  truth  In this  connection it makes  no 
difference  whether  we  think  of Science  as  the  appearance 
because it comes on the scene alongside another mode of knowcid
ledge or whether we call that other untrue knowledge its manicid
festation  In any case Science must liberate itselffrom this semcid
blance and it can do so only by turning against it  For  when 
confronted with a knowledge that is without truth Science can 
neither merely reject it as an ordinary way of looking at things 
while  assuring  us  that  its  Science  is  a  quite  different  sort  of 
cognition for which that ordinary knowedge  is  of no account 

INTRODUCTION 

 
whatever nor can it appeal to the vulgar view for the intimacid
tions  it  gives  us  of something  better  to  come  By  the  former 
assurance  Science would be declaring its power to lie simply in 
its being  but the untrue knowledge likewise appeals to the fact 
that it is  and assures us  that for it Science is of no account  One 
bare assurance is  worth just as  much  as  another  Still less  can 
Science appeal to whatever intimations  of something better it 
may detect in the cognition  that is  without truth  to  the signs 
which point in the direction of Science For one thing it would 
only  be  appealing again  to  what  merely  is  and  for  another 
it would  only  be appealing  to itself  and to itself in  the  mode 
in which it exists in the cognition that is without truth In other 
words  it would be appealing to  an inferior form  of its  being 
to the way it appears rather than to what it is  in and for itself 
I t is for this reason that an exposition of how knowledge makes 
its  appearance will  here  be  undertaken 

  Now because it has only phenomenal knowledge for its 
object  this  exposition seems  not  to  be Science  free  and self 
movingin its own peculiar shape  yet from this standpoin t tcan 
be  regarded  as  the  path  of the  natural  consciousness  which 
presses forward  to  true knowledge  or as  the way of the  Soul 
whichjourneys through the series  of its  own  configurations as 
though  they  were  the  stations  appointed  for  it  by  its  own 
natureso that it may purify itself for the Hfeof the Spirit and 
achieve finally  through a  completed  experience  of itself  the 
awareness of what it really is  in itself 

  Natural  consciousness  will  show  itself  to  be  only  the 

Notion of knowledge or in  other words  not to  be real knowcid
ledge But since it directly takes itself to be real knowledge this 
path has a negative significance for it  and what is  in fact  the 
realization of the N otlon  counts for it rather as  the loss  of its 
own self  for  it does  lose  its  truth on this  path  The  road  can 
therefore be regarded as the pathway of doubt  or more precisely 
as  the  way of despair  For what happens  on it is  not what is 
ordinarily understood when  the  word  doubt  is  used  shillycid
shallying  about  this  or  that  presumed  truth  followed  by  a 
return  to  that  truth  again  after  the  doubt  has  been  approcid
priately dispelledso that at the end of the process the matter 
is  taken to  be  what it was in  the first  place  On the contrary 
 An  allusion  perhaps to  the Stations of the  Cross 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

so 
this path is the conscious insight into the untruth ofphenomenal 
knowledge  for  which  the  supreme  reality  is  what  is  in  truth 
only  the  unrealized  Notion  Therefore  this  thoroughgoing 
scepticism is also not the scepticism with which an earnest zeal 
for truth and Science fancies it has prepared and eq ui pped itself 
in their service  the resolve  in Science not to give oneself over 
to the thoughts of others upon mere authority but to examine 
everything for oneself and follow only ones own conviction or 
better still to produce everything oneself and accept only ones 
own  deed  as  what is  true 

The  series  of  configurations  which  consciousness  goes 
through along this road is in reality the detailed history of the 
education  of consciousness  itself to  the  standpoint  of Science 
That zealous resolve represents this education simplistically as 
something directly over  and done  with  in  the  making  of the 
resolution  but the way of the Soul  is  the actual fulfilment  of 
the  resolution  in  qontrast  to  the  untruth  of that  view  Now 
following ones own conviction is  of course  more  than giving 
oneself over to  authority  but changing an opinion  accepted 
on authority into an opinion held out of personal  conviction 
does nptnecessarily alter thecpntentof the opinion orreplace 
error with tlJth  The only difference between being caught up 
ina system of opinions and prejudices  based on persona concid
viction and being caught up in one based on the authority of 
others lies in the added conceit that is inntein the former posicid
tion  The scepticism  that is  directed  against  the  whole  range 
of phenomenal consciousness  on  the other hand  renders  the 
Spiritfor  the  first  time  competent  to  examine  what  truth  is 
For it  brings  about  a  state  of despair about all  the  socalled 
naturl ideas  thoughts  and  opinions  regardless  of whether 
they are called ones own or someone elses ideaswith which the 
consciousness that sets about the examination of truth straight 
away is still filled and hampered so that it is in fact  incapable 
of carrying nut  what it wants  to  undertake 

  The  necessary  progression  and  interconnection  of the 
forms of the unreal consciousness will by itself bring to  pass  the 
completion  of the series  To make  this  more  intelligible it may 
be remarked in a preliminary and general way that the exposicid
tion of the untrue consciousness  in its  untruth is  not a  merely 
negative  procedure  The  natura  consciousness  itself normally 

INTRODUCTION 

 
takes this onesided view of it and a  knowledge  which  makes 
this  onesidedness its  very essence  is  itself one  of the  patterns 
ofincomplete consciousness which occurs on the road itself and 
will  manifest  itself in  due  course  This  is  just  the  scepticism 
which only ever sees  pure nothingness in its result and abstracts 
from the fact that this nothingness is specifically the nothingness 
of that from  which  it  results  For  it is  only  when  it is  taken  as 
the result of that from which it emerges  that it is  in fact  the 
true result in that case it is  itself a determinate  nothingness  one 
which has a content  The scepticism that ends up with the  bare 
abstraction of nothingness or emptiness cannot get any further 
from there but must wait to see whether something new comes 
along and what it is in order to throw it too into the same empty 
abyss  But when on the other hand the result is  conceived as 
it is in truth namely as a  determinate  negation a new form has 
thereby immediately arisen and in the negation the transition 
is made through which the progress through the complete series 
offorms comes  about of itself 

  But the goalis  as  necessarily fixed  for  knowledge as  the 
serial progression jtS the  point where  knowledge  no  longer 
needs to go heyonditself  where knowledge finds  itself  where 
Notion corresponds to object and object to Notion  Hence  the 
progress towards this goal is also unhalting and short of it no 
satisfaction is  to  be  found  at any of the  stations  on  the  way 
Whatever is  confined within the limits of a  natural life  cannot 
by its own efforts go  beyond its  immediate existence  but it is 
driven heyond it by something else  and this uprooting entails 
its  death  Consciousness  however  is  explicitly  the  Notion  of 
itself  Hence it is something that goes beyond limits  and since 
these limits are its own it is  something that goes beyond itself 
With the positing ofa single particular the beyond is also estabcid
lished  for  consciousness  even if it is only alongside  the  limited 
object  as  in  the  case  of spatial  intuition  Thus  consciousness 
suffers  this violence at its  own hands it spoils its own limited 
satisfaction When consciousness feels  this violence  its  anxiety 
may well  make it retreat from the truth and strive to  hold on 
to what it is  in danger of losing  But it can  find  no  peace  If 
it wishes to remain in a state of unthinking inertia then thought 
troubles its thoughtlessness and its  own  unrest disturbs its  incid
ertia Or if it entrenches itself in sentimentality which assures 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF SPIRIT 

us  that  it  finds  everything  to  be  good  in  its  kind  then  this 
assurance likewise suffers violence at the hands of Reason for 
precisely in so  far as something s  merely a  kind  Reason finds 
it not  to be good  Or again its fear of the truth may lead con  
sciousness to hide from itself and others behind the pretension 
that its burning zeal for truth makes it difficult or even imposscid
ible  to find  any other  truth but  the  unique  truth  of vanityc 
that of being at any rate  cleverer than  any thoughts  that one 
gets by oneself or from others This conceit which understands 
how to belittle every truth in order to  turn back into itself and 
gloat over its own understanding which knows how to dissolve 
every thought and always find  the same barren Ego instead of 
any contentthis is a satisfaction which we must leave to itself 
for  it fiees  from  the  universal  and  seeks  only  to  be  for  itself 
 I  In addition to  these preliminary general remarks about 
the manner and the necessity of the progression it may be useful 
to say  something about  the  method of carrying  out the  inquiry  If 
this exposition is  viewed as a way o fre lating Science  to phenomenal 
knowledgeandas an investigation andexaminatirm of the  reality 
of cognition itwouldseem that i tcannottake placewithoQ tsorne 
presupposition which can serve  as its undedying criterion  For 
anexamina tion cansistsin applying an acceptedstanclard and 
indeterminingwhethersomething is rgh tor wrong an thepasis 
of the resulting agreement or disagreementof the thing examcid
ined thus the standard as such  and Science likewise if itwere 
the  criterion  is  accepted  as  the  essence  or  as  the  initselj  But 
here where Sciencehasjust begun tocome on the scene neither 
Science nor anything else has  yet justifieditself as  the essence 
ortheinitself and without something of the sort it seems that 
no  examination  can take  place 

  This  contradiction  and  its  removal  will  become  more 
definite ifwecaU to mind the abstractdeterminations of truth 
and  knowledge as  they occur in  consciousness  Consciousness 
simultaneously  distirguishes  itself from  something  and  atthe 
same time relates itself to it or as it is said this something exists 
for  consciousness  and the  determinate  aspect  of thisrelaling 
or  of the  being  of something  for  a  consciousness  is  knowing 
But we  distinguish  this  beingforanother  from  being  initself 
whatever  is  related  to  knowledge  or  knowing  is  also  distin 
guished from it and posited as  existing outsideof this relation

INTRODUCTION 

 
ship  this  beinginitseljis  called  truth  Just  what might  be  incid
volved  in  these  determinations  is  of no  further  concern  to  us 
here Since our object is phenomenal knowledge its determinacid
tions  too  will  at first  be  taken  directly  as  they  present  themcid
selves  and they do  present  themselves  very  much  as  we  have 
already apprehended  them 

  Now if we inquire into the  truth of knowledge it seems 
tha t we are asking what knowledge is in itself  Yet in this inq uiry 
knowledge  is  our  object something that  exists jor  us  and  the 
initself that would supposedly result from  it  would  rather  be 
the being ofknowledgejor us  What we asserted to be its essence 
would be not so much its  truth  but rather just our knowledge 
of it  The essence  or criterion would  lie  within  ourselves  and 
that which was  to  be compared with it and about which a decid
cision  would  be  reached  through  this  comparison  would  not 
necessarily  have  to  recognize  the validity of such  a  standard 
  But the dissociation or this semblance of dissociation and 
presupposition is  overcome by the nature of the object weare 
investigating  Consciousness  provides  its  own  criterion  from 
within itself  so  that  the  investigation  becomes  a  comparison 
ofconsciousness with itself for the distinction made above falls 
within it  In consciousnessbne ihingexistsjoranother ie  concid
sciousness  regularly  contains  the  determinateness  of  the 
moment of knowledge  at the same time  this  other is  to  concid
sciousness not merely jor it  but is  also outside of this  relation g 
ship or exists in itself  the moment of truth Thus in what concid
sciousness affirms from withinitsef as  beinginitselfor the  True 
we have the standard which consciousness itselfsets up by which 
to  measure  what  it  knows  If we  designate  knowledge  as  the 
Notion hut the essence or the  True  as  what exists  or the object 
then the examination consists in seeing whether the Notion corcid
responds  to  the  object  But if we  call  the  essence  or  initself of 
the object  the  Notion  and on  the other hand understand by the 
object the Notion itself as  object  viz  as it existsjor an  otner  then 
the  examination  consists  in seeing  whether  the  object  correcid
sponds to its  Notion  It is  evident of course that the  two  procid
ceduresare  the same  But the essential  point to  bear in  mind 
throughout the whole investigation is  that these two moments 
Notion and obJect  beingforanother and heinginitself 
both  fall  within  that  knowledge  which  we  are  investigating 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF SPIRIT 

 
Consequently  we  do not need  to import criteria  or  to  make 
use  of our  own  bright  ideas  and  thoughts  during  the  course 
of the inquiry it is precisely when we  leave these aside that we 
succeed in contemplating the matter in hand  as  it is  in  and for 
itselj 

  But not  only is  a  contribution  by  us  superfiuous  since 
Notion and  object  the criterion and what is  to  be  tested  are 
present in consciousness itself but we are also spared the trouble 
of comparing the two and really testing them so that since what 
consciousness  examines  is  its  own self  all  that is  left for  us  to 
do is simply to look on  For consciousness is  on the  one  hand 
consciousness of the object and on the other consciousness  of 
itself consciousness of what for it is the True and consciousness 
ot its  knowledge of the truth Since both are for  the same concid
sciousness this  consCiousness is  itself their comparison it is  for 
this same consciousness  to  know  whether its  knowledge  of the 
object corresponds to  the  object or not  The object it is  true 
seems only to befor consciousness in the way thatconsciousness 
knows  it  it  seems  that  consciollsnesscannot  as  it were get 
behind the object as it exists fqrconsciousness so as  toexamine 
what the object is  in  itself  and hence too  cannot test its  own 
knowledge  by that standard  But the distinction  between  the 
initself and knowledge is  already present in the very fact  that 
consciousness knows an objectt allSomething is for  it the  incid
itself  and knowledge or the being of the object for  consciouscid
ness  is for it  another  moment  Upon  this  distinction  which 
is  presen t  as  a  fact  the  examination  rests  If the  comparison 
shows  that  these  two  moments  do  not  correspond  to  one 
another it would seem that consciousness must alter its know  
ledge to make it conform tothe object But in fact in the alteracid
tion of the knowledge the object itself alters for it too  for  the 
knowledge that was  present was essentially a  knowledge of the 
object  as  the knowledge  changes so  too  does  the  object  for 
it essentially belonged to this knowledge Hence it comes to pass 
for consciousness that what it previously took to  be the initself 
is not an initself or that it was  only an initselfjor consciousness 
Since consciousness thus finds that its knowledge does not correcid
spond to its object  the object itself does  not stand  the  test  in 
other words  the criterion for  testing is  altered  when  that for 
which  it was  to  have  been  the  criterion  fails  to  pass  the  test 

INTRODUCTION 

 
and the testing is  not only a  testing of what we know  but also 
a  testing  of the criterion of what knowing is 

  Inasmuch  as  the  new  true  object  issues from  it  this  dialectical 
movement  which  consciousness  exercises  on  itself and  which 
affects  both its  knowledge  and  its  object  is  precisely  what  is 
called  experience  Eifahrung  In  this  connection  there  is  a 
moment in the process just mentioned which must be  brought 
out more clearly for  through it a  new light will  be  thrown  on 
the  exposition  which  follows  Consciousness  knows  something 
this  object is  the  essence  or the  initself  but it is  also  for  concid
sciousness the initself This is where the ambiguity of this truth 
enters We see  that consciousness  now  has  two  objects  one is 
the first initself the second is  the beingJorconscwusness of this  incid
itself The latter appears at first sight to he merely the reflection 
of consciousness into itself ie what consciousness has in  mind 
is not an object but only its knoNledge of that first object But 
as  was  shown  previously  the  first  object  in  being  known  is 
altered  for  consciousness  it ceases  to  be  the  initself  and 
becomes something that is the in itself only for consciousness  And 
this then is the True  the beingforconsciousness of this initself 
Or in other words  this is  the essence  or the object of consciouscid
ness  This  new  object  contains  the  nothingness  of the  first  it 
is  what experience has  made of it 

  This  exposition  of the  course  of experience  contains  a 
moment in virtue of which it does not seem to agree with what 
is  ordinarily understood by experience  This is  the  moment of 
transition from  the first  object and the  knowledge  of it  to  the 
other object which experience is said to be about Our account 
implied  that  our knowledge  of the  first  object  or  the  being
forconsciousness of the first initself itself becomes the second 
object  It usually seems  to  be  the  case  on  the  contrary  that 
our experience of the untruth of our first  notion comes  by way 
of a second object which we come upon by chance and externcid
ally so that our part in aU  this  is  simply the pure apprehension 
ofwhat is in and for itself From the present viewpoint however 
the new object shows itself to have come about through a reversal 
of consciousness  itself  This way of looking atthe matter is  somecid
thing contributed  by us  by means of which  the  succession  of 
experiences  through  which  consciousness  passes  is  raised  into 
a scientific progressionbut it is not known to the consciousness 

PHENOMENOLOGY  OF  SPIRIT 

that we  are observing  But  as  a  matter of fact  we  have  here 
the same situation as the one discussed in regard to the relation 
between our exposition and scepticism  viz  that in every case 
the result of an untrue mode of knowledge must not be allowed 
to  run  away into an  empty  nothing  but  must  necessarily  be 
grasped as the nothing ofthatfrom which it resultsa result which 
contains what was  true in the  preceding knowledge  It shows 
up here like this since what first  appeared as  the object sinks 
for consciousness to the level of its way of knowing it and since 
the initself becomes a  beingjorconsciousness  of the initself  the 
latter is  now  the  new object  Herewith  a  new  pattern of concid
sciousness  comes  on  the scene  as  well  OF  which  the  essence 
is something different from  what it was at the preceding stage 
It is  this fact that guides the entire series of the patterns of concid
sciousness in their necessary seq uence  But it is  just this  necescid
sity  itself  or  the  origination  of the  new  object  that  presents 
itself  to  consciousness  without  its  understanding  how  this 
happens  which  proceeds  for  us  as  it  were  behind  the  back 
of consciousness  Thus in the movement of consciousness there 
occurs  a  moment  of beinginitself or  beingjorus  which  is  not 
present to  the  consciousness  comprehended in  the  experience 
itself  The content  however  of what  presents  itself to  US  does 
existfor it  we comprehend only the formal aspect of that concid
tent or its pure origination For  it  what has  thus  arisen  exists 
only as  an objectjor us  it appears at the same  time  as  movecid
ment and a  process  oLbecoming 

  Because  of this  necessity  the  way  to  Science  is  itself 
already Science and hence in virtue of its content is the Science 
of the experience  of consciousness 

  The  experience  of  itself  which  consciousness  goes 

through can in accordance with its Notion comprehend nothcid
ing less  tan the en tire  system  of consciousness  or  the  entire 
realm of the  truth  of Spirit  For this  reason  the  moments  of 
this  truth are exhibited in  their own  proper  determinateness 
viz  as  being  not  abstract  moments  but  as  they  are  for  concid
sciousness or as  consciousness itself stands forth  in  its  relation 
to them Thus the momen ts of the whole are patterns of consciouscid
ness  In pressing forward to its true existence consciousness will 
arrive at a point at which it gets  rid  of its semblance of being 
burdened with something alien  with what is  only for  it  and 

INTRODUCTION 

 
some  sort  of  other  at  a  point  where  appearance  becomes 
identical with essence so that its exposition will coincide at just 
this  point  with  the  authentic  Science  of Spirit  And  finally 
when  consciousness  itself grasps  this  its  own  essence  it  will 
signify  the  nature  of absolute  knowledge  itself

go  The knowledge or knowing which is at the start or is  imcid

mediately our object cannot be  anything  else  but  immediate 
know ledge itself a know ledge of the immediate or of what sim pI y 
is  Our approach to the object must also be immediate or receptive 
we must alter nothing in the object as  it presents itself  In apprecid
hending it  we  must refrain  from  trying to comprehend  it 

 I  Because  of its  concrete  content  sensecertainty  immecid
diately appears as  the richest kind qfknowledge indeed a knowcid
ledge of infinite wealth for which no bounds can be found either 
when we reach  out into space and time in which it is  dispersed 
or when we take  a  bit of this  wealth  and  by division  enter  into 
it  Moreover  sensecertainty  appears  to  be  the  truest  knowcid
ledge  for  it  has  not as  yet omitted  anything from  the  object 
but has the object before it in its  perfect entirety  But  in  the 
event this very certainty proves itself to be the most abstract and 
poorest  truth  All  that it says  about what it knows  is  just  that 
it is  and its  truth contains  nothing but the sheer being  of the 
thing Sache  Consciousness for its part is in this certainty only 
as a pure or I  am in it only as  a  pure This and the object 
similarly only as  a pure This  I  this  particular  I  am certain 
of this  particular  thing  not  because  I  qua  consciousness  in 
knowing it have developed myselfor thought about it in various 
ways and also not because the  thing  of which  I  am  certain in 
virtue of a  host  of distinct  qualities  would  be  in  its  own  self 
a  rich  complex  of connections  or  related  in  various  ways  to 
other things  Neither of these has anything to do with the truth 
of sensecertainty  here neither I  nor the  thing  has  the  significid
cance of a  complex process of mediation  the does not have 
the significance of a  manifold imagining or thinking nor does 
the  thing  signify something that  has  a  host  of qualities  On 
the contrary  the thing is  and it is  merely  because it is  It is 
this  is  the  essential  point  for  senseknowledge  and  this  pure 

SENSECERTAINTY 

 
being  or this simple immediacy constitutes its truth  Similarly 
certainty as  a  connection  is  an  immediate  pure  connection  concid
sciousness is J nothing more a pure This the singular concid
sciousness  knows  a  pure  This  or the single  item 

  But when we look carefully at this pure  being which concid

stitutes  the essence  of this  certainty  and which  this  certainty 
pronounces to be its  truth we see  that much more is involved 
An  actual sensecertainty is  not merely  this  pure  immediacy 
but an instance of it  Among the countless  differences  cropping 
up here we find  in every case  that the  crucial  one  is  that  in 
sensecertainty pure being at once splits up into what we have 
called the  two  Thises one  This as  I and  the other This 
as  object  When  we  reflect  on  this  difference  we  find  that 
neither one  nor the other is  only immediately  present  in  sense  
certainty but each is  at the same time mediated  I have this cercid
tainty through  something else  viz  the thing and it similarly 
is in sensecertainty through something else viz  through the I 
  It is  not  just  we  who  make  this  distinction  between 
essence  and instance  between immediacy and  mediation  on 
the contrary we  find  it within sensecertainty itself  and it is 
to  be taken up in the form  in which it is  present there  not as 
we  have just defined it  One of the  terms  is  posited  in  sensecid
certainty in the form  of a  simple  immediate being or as  the 
essence the object  the other however is  posited as what is  uncid
essential and mediated something which in sensecertainty is 
not in  itself but through  the  mediation  of  ail  other  the  I 
a knowing which knows the object only because the object is while 
the knowing may either be or not  be  But  the  object  is  it is 
what is  true or it is  the  essence  It is  regardless  of whether it 
is known or not and it remains even it it is not known whereas 
there is  no knowledge  if the object is  not there 

  The q uestionmust therefore  be  considered  whether in 
sensecertainty itself the object is in fact the kind of essence that 
sensecertainty proclaims it to be whether this  notion of it as 
the essence  corresponds  to  the  way  it is  present in sensecercid
tainty  To  this  end  we  have  not  to  reflect  on  it  and  ponder 
what it might be in truth hut only to consider the way in which 
it is  presen t  in sensecertain ty 

  It is  then  sensecertainty  itself  that  must  be  asked 
Whatis the  This  Ifwe take  the  This in  the  twofold  shape 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
of its  being  as  Now and as  Here  the  dialectic  it has  in  it 
will  receive a form  as  intelligible  as  the  This  itself is  To the 
question  What is  Now  let  us  answer  eg  Now  is  Nigh 
In order to test the truth of this sensecertainty a simple experi 
ment will suffice We write down this truth a truth cannot lose 
anything by being written down any more than it can lose anycid
thing through our preserving it  If now  this  noon  we  look again 
at  the  written  truth  we  shall  have  to  say  that it has  become 
stale 

g  The  same  will  be  the  case  with  the  other  form  of the 
This  with  Here  Here  iseg  the  tree  If I  turn round 

  The Now that is Night is preserved ie it is  treated as what 
it  professes  to  be  as  something  that  is  but it proves  itself to 
be on the contrary something that is  not  The Now does indeed 
preserve  itself  but as  something  that is  not  Night  eq ually  it 
preserves itself in face  of the  Day that it now  is  as  something 
that also  is  not Day  in  other  words  as  a  negative  in  general 
This selfpreservingN ow is therefore not immediate bu t medicid
ated  for  it is  determined  as  a  permanent and selfpreserving 
Now  thro ugk the fact that something else  viz  Day and  Night 
isnol  As so determined it is still just as simply Now as  before 
and in thissimplicity isinclifferent to what happens in it just 
as  little  as  Night and  Day  are  its  being just as  much  also  is 
itDay and Night it iSDnt in theleast affected by this its othercid
being  A simple  thing of this  kind which is  through  negation 
which is  neither This  nor That a  not This  and is  with  equal 
indifference This as  well  as  Thatsucha thing we  call a  unicid
versal  So  it is  iri  fact  the  universal  that is  the  true  content 
of sensecertainty 

  It is  as  a  universal  too  that we  utter  what  the  sensuous 
content is  What we say is  This  ie  the  universal  This  or 
it is ie Being in general  Of course we do not envisage  the unicid
versal  This or Being in general  but we  utter  the  universal  in 
other words wedo not strictly say what in this sense  certainty 
we mean  to say  But language  as  we  see  is  the  more  truthful 
in it we ourselves directly refute what we mean  to say and since 
the  universal  is  the  true  content  of sensecertainty  and  lancid
guage expresses  this  true  content  alone it isjust not possibe 
for  us  ever  to say  or express  in  words  a  sensuous  being  that 
we  mean 

SENS ECER TA INTY 

 
this  truth has vanished and is  converted into its  opposite  N  
tree is  here  but a  house instead  Here itself does  not vanish 
on the con trary ita bid es cons tan t in the vanishing of the house 
the tree etc and is indifferently house or tree Again therefore 
the This shows itself to be a mediated simplicity  or a  universality 
  Pure being remains therefore as  the essence of this sensecid

certainty since sensecertainty has demonstrated in its own self 
that the  truth of its  object is  the universal  But this  pure being 
is  not tn  immediacy  but something  to  which  negation  and 
mediation  are  essential j  consequently  it is  not what  we  mean 
by  being  but is  being  defined  as  an  abstraction  or  as  the 
pure universal and our meaning for which the true content 
of sensemcertainty is  not  the  universal is  all  that is  left  over in 
face  of this  empty or indifferent  Now  and  Here 

  When we compare the relation in which knowing and 
the  object first  came  on  the scene  with  the  relation in which 
they  now stand in  this  result  we  find  that it is  reversed  The 
object which was supposed to e the essential element in sensecid
certainty  is  now  the  unessential  element  for  the  universal 
which the object  has  come  to  be is  no longer what  the  object 
was supposed essentialJy to be for sensecertainty  On the concid
trary the certainty is now to  be found in the opposite element 
viz in knowing which previously was  the  unessential element 
Its  truth  is  in  the  object  as  my  object  or  in  its  being  mine 
Meinen it is because Iknow it Sensecertainty then though 
indeed expelled from  the object  is  not yet  thereby overcome 
but only driven  back  into  the    We  have  now  to  see  what 
experience shows  us  about its  reality in  the  I 

  The  force  of its  truth  thus  lies  now  in  the  P  in  the 
immediacy of my seeing hearing  and so on the vanishing of the 
single  Now  and  Here  that  we  mean  is  prevented  by  the  fact 
that I  hold  them fast  Now  is  day because  I  see  it  Here is 
a  tree  for  the same reason  But  in  this  relationship  sensecercid
tainty experiences  the same  dialectic  acting  upon  itself as  in 
the previous one  I this    see  the  tree and assert  that Here 
is  a  tree  but another  I  sees  the  house  and  maintains  that 
Here is  not a  tree  but a  house instead  Both  truths have the 
same authentication viz  the immediacy of seeing and the cercid
taintyand assurance  that both have about their knowing  but 
the one  tru th vanishes in the  other 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

  What does not disappear in all this is the as universal 
whose seeing is  neither a  seeing of the  tree  nor  of this  house 
but is a simple seeing which though mediated by the negation 
of this house etc is all the same simple and indifferent to what 
ever happens in it to the house  the tree etc  The I is  merely 
universal like  Now  Here or This  in general  I  do indeed 
mean a single but I can no more say what I  mean  in the case 
of than I  can in  the  case  of Now  and Here  When  I  say 
this Here this Now or a single item I am saying aU  Thises 
Heres  Nows  all  single  items  Similarly  when  I  say    this 
singular  I  say in  general  all  Is  everyone  is  what  I  say 
everyone is  I this singular I When Science is faced with the 
demandas if it were  an  acid  test  it  could  not  passthat it 
should  deduce  construct  find  a priori  or  however  it  is  put 
something called this thing or this one man it is  reasonable 
that the  demand should say  which  this  thing  or which  this 
particular man  is  meant  but it is  impossible  to  say this 

  Sensecertainty thus comes to know by experience that 

its essence is neither in the object norin the I  and thatits immecid
diacy is  neither an immediacy of the one nor of the other for 
in both what I  mean  is  rather something unessential  and the 
object and the I are universals in which that Now and Here 
and  I which  I  mean  do not  have  a  continuing  being  or  are 
not Thus we reach the stage where we have to posit the whole 
of sensecertainty itself as  its essence  and no  longer only one  of 
its moments as happened in the two cases where first the object 
confronting the and  then the  were  supposed  to  be  its 
reality  Thus it is  only sensecertainty as  a  whole  which stands 
firm  within  itself as  immediacy  and  by so  doing  excludes  from 
itself all  the opposition which has  hitherto obtained 

  This  pure  immediacy  therefore  no  longer  has  any 
concern with the otherness of the Here j  as  a  tree which passes 
over into a  Here  that is  not a  tree  or with  the  otherness  of 
the  Now  as  day  which  changes  into  a  Now  that  is  night 
or with another for which something else is  object  Its truth 
preserves  itself as  a  relation  that  remains  selfidentical  and 
which makes no distinction of what is  essential and what is  uncid
essential between the I and the object a relation therefore into 
which  also  no  distinction  whatever  can  penetrate  I  this 
assert then the Here as  a  tree  and do not turn round  so  that 

SENSECERTAINTY 

the Here would become for me nota tree also  I  take no notice 
of the fact  that another sees  the  Here  as  not  a  tree  or that 
I  myself at another  time  take  the  Here  as  nottree  the  Now 
as  notdy On the contrary  I  am  a  pure  act  of  intuiting 
I  for  my  part stick  to  the  fact  that  the  Now  is  day  or  that 
the Here is  a  tree also I  do not compare Here and Now themcid
selves with one another but stick firmly  to one  immediate relacid
tion  the  Now is  day 

  Since then this certainty will no longer come forth to 
us  when we direct its  attention  to  a  Now  that  is  night  or  to 
an  to whom it is  night we will approach it and let ourselves 
point to  the  Now  that is  asserted  We must let ourselves point 
to  it for the truth of this immediate relation is  the truth of this 
I which confines  itself to  one  Now or one  Here  Were we 
to  examine  this  truth afterwards  or stand  at  a distance  fronl  it 
it would lose  its  significance entirely for  that would do away 
with the immediacy which is  essential  to it  We must therefore 
enter the same point  of time or space  point them out to  ourcid
selves  ie  make ourselves into  the  same  singular  I  which  is 
the one who knows  with certainty  Let us  then see  how  that 
immediate is  constituted that is  pointed out to  us 

  The Now is pointed to this Now  Now it has already 
ceased  to  be in  the act  of pointing  to  it  The  Now  that  is  is 
another Now than the one pointed to and we see that the Now 
is  just  this  to  be  no  more just when  it   The  Now  as  it is 
pointed out  to  us  is  Now  that has  been  and  this  is  its  truth 
it has not the  truth  of being  Yet  this  much  is  true  that it has 
been  But what essentially has  been  gewesen  ist  is  in fact  not 
an essence  that is  kein  Wesen  it  is  not  and  it  was  with  being 
that we were concerned 

  In this  pointingout then  we  see  merely a  movement 
which  takes  the  following  course  I  I  point  out  the  Now 
and it is  asserted  to  be  the  truth  I  point it out  however  as 
something that has  been  or as  sonlething that has  been  super 
seded I  set aside the first  truth    I  now assert as  the second 
truth  that it has  been  that  it is  superseded    But what  has 
been isnot I set aside the second truth its having been  its super  
session and thereby negate the negation of the Now and thus 
return to the first assertion  that the Now  is  The  Now  and 
pointing out the Now are thus so constituted  that neither the 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

one nor  the  other is  something  immediate  and  simple  but  a 
movement which contains various moments A  This  is  posited 
but it is rather an other that is posited or the This is superseded 
and this otherness  or the settingaside of the first  is  itslf in  turn 
set aside  and so  has returned into the first  However  this  first 
thus  reflected  into  itself  is  not  exactly  the  same  as  it  was  to 
begin with viz something immediate  on the contrary it is somecid
thing that is reflected into itself or a simple entity which in its othercid
ness  remains what it is  a  Now which is  an absolute  plurality 
of Nows  And  this  is  the  true  the  genuine  Now  the  Now  as 
asim pleda ywhich con tains wi thin i t man y N owshours A Now 
of this sort an hour similarly is  many  minutes and  this  Now 
is likewise many Nows and so on The pointingout of the Now 
is  thus itself the  movement  which  expresses  what  the  Now  is 
in truth viz a result or a plurality ofNows all taken together 
and the pointingout is  the experience of learning that Now is 
a  universal 

loB  The Here  pointed out  to  which  I  hold  fast  is  similarly 
a  this  Here  which  in  fact  is  not  this  Here  but a  Before  and 
Behind  an Above  and  Below  a  Right  and  Left  The  Above 
is  itself similarly this  manifold otherness of above  below  etc 
The  Here  which  was  supposed  to  have  been  pointed  out 
vanishes  in  other  Heres  but  these  likewise  vanish  What  is 
pointed out  held  fast  and abides  is  a  negative  This  which  is 
negative only when the Heres are taken as  they should be  but 
in  being so  taken  they  supersede  thetnselves  what  abides  is 
a simple complex of many Heres The Here that is  meant would 
be the point but it is  not on the contrary when it is  pointed 
out as something that is  the pointingout shows itself to  be not 
an immediate knowing  of the  point  but  a  movement from 
the Here that is  meant  through  many Heres into the  universal 
Here which is  a  simple  plurality of Heres just as  the day is  a 
simple plurality of Nows 

log  I t is clear that the dialectic of sensecertainty is nothing 
else but the simple history orits movement or of its experience 
and sensecertainty itself is  nothing  else  but just  this  histdry 
That is  why  the natural consciousness  too  is  always  reaching 
this  result  learning  from  experience  what  is  true  in  it  but 
equally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement all 
over again It is  therefore astonishing when in face  of this  ex

SENSECER TAINTY 

perience it is asserted as universal experience and put forward 
too  as  a  philosophical  proposition  even  as  the  outcome  of 
Scepticism  that  the  reality or  being  of external  things  taken 
as  Thises or senseobjects has absolute truth for  consciousness 
To make such an assertion is  not  to  know  what one  is  saying 
to be unaware that one is saying the opposite of what one wants 
to say The truth for consciousness ofa This of sense is supposed 
to  be  universal  experience  but  the very  opposite  is  universal 
experience  Every consciousness itself supersedes such  a  truth 
as eg Here is a tree  Of Now is noon and proclaims the oppocid
site Here is not a tree but a house and similarly it immediately 
again supersedes  the  assertion  which  set  aside  the  first  so  far 
as it is also just such an assertion of a sensuous This  And what 
consciousness will learn from  experience in all  sensecertainty 
is in truth only what we  have seen viz  the This as  a universal 
the very opposite ofwhat that assertion affirmed to be universal 
experien ce 

With  this  appeal  to  universal  experience  we  may  be  percid

mitted to an ticipatehow the case stands in the practical sphere 
In this  respect we can tell  those  who assert  the  truth and cercid
tainty of the reality  of senseobj ects  thal  they should  go  hack 
to the most elemen tary school of wisdom viz  the ancien  EIeucid
sinian Mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus and that they have stillto 
learn the secre t meaning of theea ting ofhread and the drinking 
of wine  For he who  is  initiated into  these  Mysteries  not only 
comes to doubt the being of sensuous  things  but to  despair of 
it in part he brings about the nothingness of such things himself 
in his dealings with them and in part he sees them reduce them 
selves to nothingness Even the  animals are  not shut out from 
this wisdom buton the contrary show  themselves  to  be  most 
profoundly initiated  into it for  they do  not just stand  idly in 
frontofsenuous things as if these possessed intrinsic being but 
despairing  of their  reality  and  completely  assured  of their 
nothingness  they fall  to without ceremony and  eat  them  up 
And all  Nature  like  the  animals  celebrates  these  open  Myscid
teries  which teach  the  truth about sensuous things 

I   But just as  our previous remarks would  suggest  those 
who put forward such an assertion also themselves say the direct 
opposite of what they mean  a  phenomenon  which is  perhaps 
best calculated to induce them to reflect on the nature of sense

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

certainty They speak of the existence of external objects which 
can  be  more  precisely  defined  as  actual  absolutely  singular 
wholly personal individual things  each of them absolutely unlike 
anything else  this  existence  they say  has  absolute  certainty 
and truth They mean this bit of paper on which I  am writingcid
or rather have writtenthis but what they mean is  not what 
they say If they actually wanted to say this bit of paper which 
they  mean  if they  wanted  to  say  it  then  this  is  impossible 
because the sensuous This that is  meant cannot be reached by lancid
guage which belongs  to consciousness ie  to that which is  incid
herently  universal  In  the  actual  attempt  to  say  it  it  would 
therefore crumble away those who started to describe it would 
not be able to complete the description but would be compelled 
to leave it to others who would themselves finally have to admit 
tospeaking about something which is not  They certainly mean 
then  this  bit  of paper  here  which  is  quite  different  from  the 
bit mentioned above  but they  say  actual  things  external  or 
sensuous  objects  absolutely  singular  entities  Wesen  and  so  on 
ie they say of them only what is universal  Consequently what 
is  called the unutterable  is  nothing  else  than the  untrue  the 
irrational what is merely meant but is not actuallyexpressed 
If nothing more is said of some thing than that it is  an  actual 
thing  an  external  object  its  description  is  only  the  most 
abstract of generalities and in faet  expresses  its  sameness with 
everything rather than its distinctiveness When I say a single 
thing  I  am  really saying  what  it is  from  a  wholly  universal 
point of view for everything is  a single thing and likewise this 
thing  is  anything you Hke  If we  describe  it  more  exactly  as 
this bit of paper then each and eVTY bit of paper is  this  bit 
of paper and  I  have  only uttered  the  universal  all  the  time 
But if I wantto help outlanguagewhich has the divine nature 
of directly reversing the meaning of what is  said  of making it 
into something else and thus not letting what is  meant get  into 
words at allby pointing out this bhofpaper experience teaches 
me what the  truth of sensecertainty in  fact  is  I  point  it out 
as  a  Here  which  is  a  Here  of other  Heres  or  is  in  its  own 
selfa simple togetherness of many Heres ie  it is  a universal 
I take it up then as  it is  in truth and instead of knowing some 
thing immediate  I  take  the  truth of it  or perceive  it  
I  The German for  to perceive is  wahrnehmen  which  means  literally  to take  truly 

PERCEPTION 

II  PERCEPTION  OR  THE  THING  AND 

DECEPTION 

I  I  I  Immediate certainty does  not take  over the  truth  for 
its truth is  the universal whereas certainty wants to apprehend 
the This  Perception on  the other hand  takes what is  present 
to it as a universal Just as universality is its principle in general 
the  immediately  selfdifferentiating moments  within  percep 
tion are universal I is a universal and the object is  a universal 
That principle has arisen for us and therefore the way we  take 
in  perception  is  no  longer something  that just  happens  to  us 
like sensecertainty on the contrary it is logically necessitated 
With the emergence of the principle  the  two  moments which 
in their appearing merely occur also come into being one being 
the movement of pointingout or the act of perceiving  the  other 
being the same movement as a simple event or the object perceived 
In essence  the object is  the same as  the movement  the  move 
ment is  the unfolding and differentiation of the  two  moments 
and the obj ect is the apprehended togetherness of the momen t 
For us  or in  itself  the  universal as  principle is  the  essence  of 
perception  and  in  contrast  to  this  abstraction  both  the 
moments distinguishedthat which perceives and  that which 
is perceivedare the unessentiaL But in fact because both are 
themselves the universal or the essence  both are essential  Yet 
since they are related to each other as  opposites  only one  can 
be  the essential moment in the relation and  the  distinction  of 
essential  and  unessential  moment  must  be  shared  between 
them  One of them the object defined  as  the simple  entity 
is  the essence  regardless of whether it is  perceived or not  but 
the act of perceiving as a movement is the unessential moment 
the  unstable facton which  can as  well  be as  not be 

I   This object m us t now be defined more precisely and the 
definition  must be developed  briefly  from  the  result  that  has 
been reached the more detailed development does not belong 
here  Since  the  principle of the  object  the  universal is  in  its 
simplicity a  mediated universal  the object must express  this  its 
nature in its  own self  This it does  by showing  itself to  be  the 
thing with many properties The wealth ofsenseknowedge belongs 
to perception not to immediate certainty for which it was only 
the source of instances for only perception contains negation 
that is  difference  or manifold ness  within its own  essence 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

   The This is therefore established as not This or as somecid

thing superseded and hence not as  Nothing but as  a  determi 
nate Nothing  the Nothing of a  content viz  of the This  Concid
sequently the senseelement is  still present  but not in  the way 
it was supposed to  be in  the position of  immediate certainty 
not as  the singular item that is  meant  but as  a  universal  or 
as  that which will  be defined as  a  property  Supersession  exhibits 
its  true  twofold meaning which we  have seen  in  the  negative 
it is at once a negating and a preserving Our Nothing as  the Nothcid
ing of the This preserves its  immediacy and is  itself sensuous 
but it is  a  universal immediacy Being  however is  a  universal 
in virtue of its having mediation or the negative within it when 
it expresses  this  in  its  immediacy it is  a  differentiated  determinate 
property As a result many such properties are established simulcid
taneously  one  being  the  negative  of another  Since  they  are 
expressed  in  the  simplicity  of  the  universal  these  detercid
minacieswhich are properties strictly speaking only through 
the addition of a further determinationare related only  to 
themselves  they are indifferent to one  another  each  is  on its 
own and free from the others But the simple selfidentical unicid
versalityisitselfin turn distinct and free from these determinate 
propertiesithas It is  pure relating of self to self  or the medium 
in which all these  determinacies  are  and in  which as  a  simple 
unity they therefore interpenetrate but without coming into concid
tactwithone another  for  it is  precisely  through participating 
in  this  universality  that  they  exist  indifferently  on  their  own 
account 

This abstract universal medium which can be called simply 
thinghood  or pure essence  is  nothing else  than  what  Here 
and Now have proved themselvess to be viz  a simple togetherness 
ofa plurality but the many are  in  their  determinateness  simple 
universals  themselves  This  salt is  a  simple  Here  and  at  the 
same  time  manifold  it  is  white  and  also  tart  also  cubical  in 
shape of a specific gravity etc  All  these  many properties are 
in  a  single  simple  Here  in  which  therefore  they  intercid
penetrate none has a  different Here from the others but each 
is  everywhere in the same Here in which the others are  And 
at the same time  without being separated  by  different  Heres 
they  do  not  affect each  other  in  this  interpenetration  The 
whiteness does not affect the cubical shape and neither affects 

PERCEPTION 

 
the tart taste etc on the contrary since each is itself a simple 
relating of self to selfit leaves the others alone and is connected 
with  them only  by  the indifferent Also  This  Also  is  thus  the 
pure  universal  itself  or  the  medium  the  thinghood  which 
holds  them  together in  this  way 

I    In  the  rela tionshi p  which  has  thus  emerged  it  is  only 
the character of positive  universality  that  is at first  observed 
and developed  but a  further side  presents  itself  which  must 
also be taken into consideration To wit if the  many determicid
nate properties were strictly indifferent to one another if they 
were simply and solely selfrelated they would not be determicid
nate for they are only determinate in so far as  they differentiate 
themselves from  one  another  and relate  themselves  to  others  as 
to  their  opposites  Yet  as  thus  opposed  to one  another  they 
cannot be together in the simple unity of their medium which 
is  just as  essential  to  them  as  negation  the  differentiation  of 
the properties in so far as it is not an indifferent differentiation 
but isexcusive  each property negating  the  others  thus  falls 
outside of this simple  medium  and the  medium  therefore  is 
not merely an Also  an indifferent unity  but a  One  as  well  a 
unity which excludes an other The One is the momentof negation 
it is  itself quite simply a  relation  of self to selfapd  it excludes 
an other and it is that by which thinghood is determined as 
a Thing Negation is  inherent in a property as  a  determinateneM 
which  is  immediately  one  with  the  immediacy  of being  an 
immediacy  which  through  this  unity  with  negation  is  uni 
versality  As  a  One  however  the  determinatetless  is  set free 
from  this  unity  with  its  opposite  and  exists  in  and  for  itself 
I    In  these  moments taken  together  the  Thing  a  the 

truth of perception is  completed soJar as it is  necessary to decid
velop it here  It is  a  an indiffertnt  passive  universality the 
Also of the many  properties  or rather matters  b  negation 
equally simply  or the One  which excudes opposite properties 
and  c  the many properties  tbemsel ves  the  relation of the  first 
two  moments  or negation as  it relates  to  the  indifferent  elea 
ment and therein expands into a  host of differences  the point 
ofsingularindividuality in the medium of subsistence radiating 
forth into plurality  In so far as  these differences  belong to  the 
indifferent  medium  they  are  themselves  universal  they  are 
related only to  themselves  and do  not affect one another  But 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

in so  far  as  they  belong  to  the  negative  unity  they  are  at  the 
same time exclusive  of other properties  but they necessarily 
have this relationship of opposition  to  properties  remote from 
their  Also  The sensuous  universality  or the  immediate  unity of 
being and  the  negative  is  thus  a  property  only  when  the  One 
and the pure universality are developed from it and differenticid
ated from each other and when the sensuous universality unites 
them it is  this  relation of the universality to  the pure essential 
moments which  at last  completes  the  Thing 

I    This  then  is  how  the  Thing  of  perception  is  concid

stituted and consciousness is determined as percipient in so far 
as this Thing is  its object  It has only to take  it  to confine itself 
to  a  pure apprehension  of it  and  what  is  thus  yielded  is  the 
True  If consciousness  itself did  anything  ip  taking  what  is 
given it would by such adding or subtraction  alter the  truth 
Since  the  object is  the  True  and  universal  the  selfidentical 
while consciousness is  alterable and unessential it can happen 
that  consciousness  apprehends  the  object  incorrectly  and 
deceives itself  The percipient is  aware of the  possibility  of decid
ception for in the universality which is  the  principle  otherness 
itself is  immediately present for  him  though  present  as  what 
is  null and superseded  His  criterion  of truth is  therefore  seljcid
identity  and his  behaviour consists in  apprehending the object 
as  selfidentical  Since at the same  time  diversity  is  explicitly 
there for him it is  a  connection of the  diverse moments  df his 
apprehension to one another but if a dissimilarity makes itself 
felt in the course of this comparison then this is  not an untruth 
of the  objectfor this  is  the self  identicalbut an untruth in 
perceiving it 

I    Let  us  see  now  what  consciousness  experiences  in  its 
actual perceiving For  us  this  experience is  already contained 
in  the development of the object  and  of the  attitude  of concid
sciousness  towards it given just now  It is  only a  matter of decid
Veloping the contradictions that are present therein The object 
which  I  apprehend  presents  itself purely as  a  One  but  I  also 
perceive in it a  property which is  universal  and whichthereby 
transcends the singularity of the object The first  being of the 
objective essence as a One was therefore not its  true being  But 
since the object is whatis true the untruth falls in me my apprecid
hension  was  not correct  On account of the  universality  of the 

PERCEPTION 

property I  must rather take  the objective essence  to be on the 
whole  a  community  I  now further  perceive  the  property  to  be 
determinate  opposed to another and excluding it  Thus I  did  not 
in fact apprehend the objective essence correctly when I defined 
it as  a  community  with  others  or  as  a  continuity  on  account 
of  the  determinateness  of  the  property  I  must  break  up  the 
continuity  and  posit  the  objective  essence  as  a  One  that 
excludes 

In the  broken  up  One  I  find  many sllch  properties  which 

do not affect one another but are mutually indifferent Therecid
fore  I did not perceive the object correctly when  apprehended 
it as  exclusive  on  the  contrary just  as  previouly  it  was  only 
continuity in general  so  now  it  is  a  universal  common  medium 
in which many properties are present as  sensuous  universalities 
each existing on its  own account and  as  determinate  excluding 
the others But this being so what I  perceive as  the simple and 
the True is  also not a  universal medium but the single property 
by  itself which  however as  such  is  neither a  property  nor  a 
determinate being for now it is neither in a One nor connected 
with others  Only when it belongs  to  a  One  is  it  a  property 
and only in  relation  to  others  is  it determinate  As  this  pure 
relating  of itself to  itself  it  remains  merely  senSUOUJ  being  in 
general since it nolonger possesses the character of negativity 
and  the consciousness  which takes its  object  to  be  a  sensuous 
being is  only  my  meaning  ein  Meinen  ie  it has  ceased  altocid
gether to perceive and has withdrawn into itself  But sensuous 
being and  my  meaning  themselves  pass  over  into  perception 
I am thrown back to the beginning and drawn once again into 
the same cycle which supersedes itself in  each  moment and  as 
a  whole 

I    Consciousness  therefore necessarily runs  through  this 
cycle again but this time not in the same way as it did the first 
time  For  it  has  experienced  in  perception  that  the  outcome 
and the truth of perception is its dissolution or is  reflection out 
of the True and  into itself  Thus it  becomes quite definite for 
consciousness  how  its  perceiving  is  essentially  constituted 
viz  that it is not a simple pure apprehension but in its apprehencid
sion is  at the same time reflected out Q the  True  and into itself  This 
return of consciousness into itself which is  directly mingled with 
the pure apprehension of the objectJfor this return into itself 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
has shown itself to be essential  to perceptionalters the truth 
Consciousness atonce recognizes this aspect as its own and takes 
responsibility for  it  by doing so  it will  obtain  the  true  object 
in its purity This being so we have now in  the case ofpercepcid
tion  the same as  happened in  the  case  of sensecertainty the 
aspect of consciousness  being driven  back into itself  but not 
in  the  first  instance  in  the  sense  in  which  this  happened  in 
sensecertainty ie  not as  if the truth  of perception fell  in  concid
sciousness  On the contrary consciousness recognizes  that it is 
the untruth  occurring in  perception  that falls  within  it  But by 
this very recognition it is able at once to supersede this untruth 
it distinguishes its  apprehension of the  truth from  the  untruth 
of its perception corrects this  untruth and since it undertakes 
to make this correction itself  the  truth  qua  truth of perception 
falls  of course  within  consciousness  The  behaviour of conscious  
ness  which we have now to consider is  thus so  constituted  that 
consciousness no longer merely perceives  but is  also conscious 
ofits reflection into itself and separates this from simple appre  
hension  proper 

  At first  then  I  become aware of the  Thing as  a  One 
and have to  hold fast  to it in  this  its  true character if  in  the 
course ot perceiving it something turns  up which contradicts 
it  this  is  to  be  recognized  as  a reflection  of mine  Now  there 
also occur in  the  perception various  properties which  seem  to 
be properties of the Thing but the Thing fs  a One and we are 
conscious  that this  diversity  by  which  it  would  cease  to  be  a 
One falls  in us  So in  point of fact  the  Thing is  white only to 
our  eyes  also  tart to  our  tongue  also  cubical  to  our  touch  and 
so on We get the entire diversity of these aspects  not from  the 
Thing  but from  ourselves  and  they  fall  asunder  in  this  way 
for  us  because  the eye  is  quite distinct from  the  tongue  and 
so on Weare thus  the universal medium in which such moments 
are kept apart and exist each on its own Through the fact  then 
that we  regard the characteristic of being a  universal  medium 
as  our reflection we  preserve  the self  identity and  truth of the 
Thing  its  being a  One 

l  But regarded as existing each for itself in  the  unversa 

medium these diverse aspects for which consciousness accepts recid
sponsibility  are  specifically  determined  White  is  white  only  in 
opposition to hlack and so on and the Thing is a One precisely 

PERCEPTION 

 
by being opposed to others But it is not as a One that it excludes 
others from  itself  for  to  be  a  One is  the  universal  relating  of 
self to  self  and  the  fact  that  it  is  a  One  rather  makes  it  like 
all  the  others  it  is  through  its  determinateness  that  the  thing 
excludes  others  Things  are  therefore  in  and  for  themselves 
determinate  they  have  properties  by  which  they  distinguish 
themselves from others  Since the  property  Eigenschaft  is  the 
Things own  eigene  property or a determinateness in  the Thing 
itself  the  Thing has  a  number of properties  For  in  the  first 
place  the  Thing is  what is  true  ie  it possesses  intrinsic  being 
and  what is  in  it  is  there  as  the  Things  essence  and  not  on 
account of other things  Secondly  therefore  the  determinate 
properties do not only exist on account of other things  and for 
other things  but in the Thing itself  yet  they are  determinate 
properties in it only because they are a  plurality of reciprocally 
selfdifferentiating elements And thirdly since this is how they 
are in the thinghood Le  the essence of the one  thing of which 
they are properties they exist in and for themselves indifferent 
to one another It is in truth then the Thing itself that is white 
and also cubical also  tart and so on  In other words the Thing 
is the Also or the universal medium in which the many properties 
subsist apart from one another without touching or cancelling 
one another and when so taken the Thing is  perceived as what 
is  true 

  Now in  perceiving in this way consciousness  is  at the 
same  time aware  that it is  also  reflected  in to  itself  and  that 
in perceiving  the  opposite  moment to the Also  turns  up  But 
this moment is  the unity of the Thing with itself  a  unity which 
excludes  difference  frDm  itself  Accordingly  it  is  this  unity 
which consciousness has to take upon itself for the Thing itself 
is the subsistence of the  many diverse  and independent properties  Thus 
we say of the Thing it is white also  cubical and also  tart and 
so  on  But in  so far as it is  white  it is  not cubical  and  in  so far 
as it is cubical and also white it is  not tart and so on Positing 
these properties as  a  oneness is  the work of consciousness alone 
which therefore has to prevent them from collapsing into onecid
ness  in  the  Thing  To  this  end it brings  in  the  in so  far  in 
this  way  preserving  the  properties  as  mutually external  and 
the Thing as  the Also  Quite rightly  consciousness makes itself 
responsible for the oneness at first in such a way that what was 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
called a  property is  represented as  free  matter  The  Thing is 
in this way raised to the level ofa genuine Also since it becomes 
a  collection of matters and  instead of being a  One  becomes 
merely an  enclosing surface 

  Ifwe look back on what consciousness  previously took 
and  now  takes  responsibility  for  on  what  it  previously 
ascribed and now ascribes to the Thing we see that consciouscid
ness  alternately makes itself  as  well  as  the  Thing into both a 
pure  manyless  One  and  into an  Also  that  resolves  itself into 
independent  matters  Consciousness  thus  finds  through  this 
comparison  that  not  only  its  truthful  perceiving  Nehmen  des 
Wahren  contains  the  distinct  moments  oj apprehension  and  withcid
drawal  into  itself  but  rather  that  the  truth  itself  the  Thing 
reveals itself in this  twofold way  Our experience then is  this 
that the Thing exhibits itsefjor the  consciousness  apprehending  it 
in a specific  manner but is  at  the  same  time  reflected  out of the 
way in which it  presents  itself to  consciousness  and  back  into 
itself in other words it contains in its own self an opposite truth 
to that which it  has  for  the apprehending consciousness 

  Thus consciousness has got beyond this second  type of 
attitude in  perceiving  too  ie  the one  in  which  it  takes  the 
Thing as truly selfidentical and itselffor whatis notselfidenticid
cal but returns back into itself out of identity The object is now 
for  consciousness  this  whole  movement  which  was  previously 
shared  between  the object and  consciousness  The Thing is  a 
One reflected into itself it isJor tselj  but it is  alsoJof an  other 
and moreover it is  an other on its  own  account just because  it 
is  for  an other Accordingly  the Thing is  for itself and also  for 
an  other  a  being that is  doubly  differentiated but also  a  One 
but the oneness contradicts this diversity  Hence consciousness 
would  again  have  to  assume  responsibility  for  placing  the 
diversity  in the One and for  keeping it away from  the Thing 
It would  have  to say  that in  so far  as  it is  for  itself  the  Thing 
is  not for  an  other  But the  onenss also  belongs  to  the  Thing 
itself as  consciousness  has  found  by experience  the  Thing  is 
essentially reflected into itself  The Also  or the indifferent difcid
ference thus falls as much within the Thing as does the oneness 
but since the two are different they do not fall  within the same 
Thing  but  in  different  Things  The  contradiction  which  is 
present  in  the  objective  essence  as  a  whole  is  distributed 

PERCEPTION 

 
between two objects In and for itself the Thing is selfidentical 
but  this  unity  with  itself is  disturbed  by  other  Things  Thus 
the  unity of the  Thing is  preserved  and  at  the same  time  the 
otherness  is  preserved  outside of the  Thing  as  well  as  outside 
of consciousness 

  Now  although it is  true  that the  contradiction in  the 
objective  essence  is  in  this  way  distributed  among  different 
Things  yet  the  difference  will  for  that  reason  attach  to  the 
singular separated  Thing  itself  The  different  Things  are  thus 
established as  existing  on  their own  account  and  the  conflict 
between them is sofar reciprocal that each is different not from 
itself but only from the other But each is  thereby determined 
as  being itslf a different Thing and it has its essential difference 
in its  own  self  but all  the  while  not as  if this  difference  were 
an opposition in  the Thing itself  On  the  contrary for itself it 
is a simple determinateness  which constitutes the Things essential 
character and differentiates it from others   As  a matter offact 
since  differentness  is  present  in  it  it  is  of course  necessarily 
present  as  an  actual  difference  manfoldly  constituted  Eut 
because  the  determinateness  constitutes  the  essence  of  the 
Thing  by which  it  distinguihes itself from  other Things  and 
is for itself  this further manifold constitution is  the unessential 
aspect Consequently the Thing does indeed have the twofold 
in so far within its unity but the aspects are unequal in value 
As  a  result  this  state  of opposition  does  not  develop  into an 
actual opposition in the Thing itself  but in so far as  the Thing 
through  its  absolute  difference  comes  into  a  state  of opposition 
it is  opposed  to  another  Thing  outside  of it  Of course  the 
further manifold ness is  necessarily present in the Thing too so 
that it cannot be left out but it is  the unessential aspect of the 
Thing 

  This  determinateness  which  constitutes  the  essential 
character of the Thing and  distinguishes  it from  all  others  is 
now defined in such a way that the Thing is  thereby in opposiM 
tion  to other Things but is  supposed  to  preserve its  indepencid
dence in this opposition But it is  only a  Thing J  or a  One  that 
exists  on its  own account in so  far  as  it does  not stand in  this 
relation to others for  this  relation  establishes  rather its  conticid
nuity with others  and for  it  to  be connected with others is  to 
cease to exist on its  own account  It isjust through the absolute 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

character  of the  Thing and  its  opposition  that it  relates  itself to 
others  and  is  essentially only  this  relating  The  relation  how 
ever  is  the  negation  of its  selfsubsistence  and it is  really  the 
essential  property  of the  Thing  that is  its  undoing 

  The  conceptual  necessity  of  the  experience  through 
which consciousness discovers  that the Thing is  demolished  by 
the  very  determinateness  that  constitutes  its  essence  and  its 
beingforaself  can  be  summarized  as  follows  The  Thing  is 
posited as beingfor itself or as the absolute negation of all other 
ness  therefore as  purely selfarelated negation but the  negation 
that is self  rela ted is  the suspension of itself  in other words the 
Thing has  its  essential  being in  another Thing 

  In fact  the definition of the  object  as  it has  emerged 
has shown itself to contain  nothing else  The object is  defined 
as  having within  it  an  essential  property which  constitutes  its 
simple  beingforself  but  along  with  this  simple  nature  the 
object is  also to contain diversity which though necessary  is  not 
to  constitute  its  essential  determinateness  This  however  is  a 
distinction  that is  still  only  nominal  the  unessential  which is 
nOne  the less  supposed  to be necessary  cancels  itself out  It is 
what  has just been  called  the  negation of itself 

  With this  the last  in so  far  that separated  beingfor 
self from  beingforanother falls  away  on  the  contrary  the 
object is in one and tke samerespecttheopposlteofitselJ  it isfor itself 
sofaras it isforanother  and it is for another  sofar as  it isfar itself 
It is  for  itself  reflected  into  itself  a  One  but  this  foritself 
this reflection into itself  this  being a One is  posited in a  unity 
with its  opposite  with its  beingforanother and  hence only 
as cancelled in other words this beingforselfisjust as unessen 
tial as  the only aspect  that was supposed  to be  unessential viz 
the  relationship  to  another 

  Thus the object in its pure determinatenesses or in  the 
detenninatenesses which were supposed to constitute its  essen 
tial  being  is  overcome just as  surely  as  it  was  in  its  sensuous 
being  From a  sensuous  being it  turned into  a  universal  but 
this  universal since it originates in  the  sensuous  is  essentially concid
ditioned by it and hence is not truly a selfidentical universality 
at all  but one ajlicted with an  opposition  for  this  reason  the unicid
versaHtysplits  into  the  extremes  of singular individuality and 
universality into the One of the properties and the Also of the 

PERCEPTION 

 
free matters These pure determinatenesses seem to express the 
essential nature itself  but  they  are  only  a  beingQfor  self  that 
is  burdened  with  a  beingforanother Since  however  both 
are essentially in a single unity what we now have is  unconditioned 
absolute universality and consciousness here for the first time truly 
enters  the  realm of the  Understanding 

  Thus the singular being of sense does indeed vanish  in 
the dialectical movement of immediate certainty and becomes 
universality but it is  only a sensuous  universality  My  meaning 
has  vanished  and  perception  takes  the  object as  it is  in  itself 
or as a universal as such Singular being therefore emerges in the 
object as true singleness as the initselfofthe One or as a reflec  
tednessintoself But this is still a conditioned being  forself alongcid
side which appears another beingfor  self  the universality which 
is opposed to and conditioned by singular being But these two 
contradictory extremes  are  not merely  alongside  each  other  but 
in a single unity or in other words  the defining characteristic 
common to both viz  beingforself is  burdened with opposi 
tion  generally  ie  it is  at  the same  time  not  a  beingforself 
The sophistry of perception seeks  to save  these  moments from 
their contradiction and it seeks  to  lay  hold  on  the  truth  by 
distinguishing between the aspects  by sticking to  the Also and 
to the in sofar and finally by distinguishing the unessential 
aspect  from  an  essence  which  is  opposed  to  it  But  these 
expedients  instead of warding off deception in  the  process  of 
apprehension  prove  themselves  on the  contrary  to  be  quite 
empty and the truth which is supposed to be won  by this logic 
of the  perceptual process  proves  to be in one and the same recid
spect  the  opposite  of itself  and  thus  to  have  as  its  essence  a 
universality which is devoid of distinctions and determinations 
 I  These empty abstractions of a  Isingleness  and a  uni 
versality opposed to it and of an  essence  that is  linked  with 
something unessentiala nonessential aspect which is  necescid
sary all the samethese are powers whose interplay is  the percid
ceptual  understanding  often  called  Isound  common  sense 
This sound common sense which takes itself to be a solid realcid
istic  consciousness  is  in  the  perceptual process  only the  play 
of these  abstractions  generally it is  always  at its  poorest where 
it fancies itsdftobe the richest Bandied about by these vacuous 
essences  thrown  into  the  arms  first of one  and  then  of the 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

other and striving by its sophistry to hold fast and affirm alterncid
ately first  one  of the  essences  and  then  the  directly  opposite 
one  it sets  itself against the  truth and holds  the  opinion  that 
philosophy is concerned only with mental entities  As  a  matter 
offact philosophy does  have to do with them too  recognizing 
them as  the  pure essences  the  absolute  elements  and  powers 
but in  doing  so  recognizes  them  in  their  specific  determinateness 
as well and is  therefore master over them whereas  perceptual 
understanding  or  sound common  sense  takes  them  for  the 
truth and is  led on by them from one error to another  It does 
not itself become conscious that it is  simple essentialities of this 
kind  that hoJd  sway over it  but fancies  that it has  always  to 
do with wholly substantial material and content just as sensecid
certainty is  unaware that the empty abstraction of pure  being 
is  its essence  But it is  in fact  these essentialities within  which 
perceptual understanding runs  to  and fro  through  every kind 
of material and content they are the cohesive power and mascid
tery over  that content and  they alone  are  what  the  sensuous 
is as essence for consciousness they are what determines the relacid
tions  of the sensuous  to  it  and  it  is  in  them  that  the  process 
of perception and ofits truth runs its course Thiscourse a  percid
petualalternationof determining what is  true and then setting 
aside this determining constitutes strictly speaking the steady 
everyday life  and  activity of perceptual  consciousness  a  concid
sciousness which fancies itself to be moving in the realm of truth 
It advances uninterruptedly to the outcome in which all  these 
essential  essentialities  or  determinations  are  equally  set 
aside bu t in each single momen tit is  conscious only of this one 
determinateness as  the truth and then in tun of the opposite one 
It docs  indeed  suspect  their  unessentiality  and  to  save  them 
from  the danger thrcltening  them it resorts  to  the sophistry of 
asserting to be true what it has itself just declared  to  be  untrue 
What the nature of these  untrue essences is  really trying to get 
perceptual  understanding  to  do  is  to  bring  together  and 
thereby  supersede  the  thoughts  of  those  nonentities 
the 
thoughts of that universality and singular being  of Also  and 
One of the essentiality that is necessarily linked to the unessencid
tial  moment  and  of an  unessential  moment  that yet  is  necescid
sary  But  the  Understanding struggles  to  avoid  doing  this  by 
resorting to in so far as and to the various aspects or by mak

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
ing itself responsible for one thought in order to keep the other 
one isolated as the true one But the very nature of these abstraccid
tions brings them together of their own accord It is  sound comcid
mon sense  that  is  the  prey  of these  abstractions  which spin 
it  round  and  round  in  their  whirling  circle  When  common 
sense  tries  to  make them true by  at one  time  making itself recid
sponsible for their untruth while at another time it calls  their 
deceptiveness  a  semblance of the  unreliability of Things  and 
separates what is  essential  from  what is  necessary  to  them yet 
supposedly unessential holding the former to be their truth as 
against the  latterwhen it does  this  it does  not  secure  them 
their  truth  but convicts  itself of untruth 

III  FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 
APPEARANCE  AND  THE  SUPERSENSIBLE 

WORLD 

  In the dialectic of sensecertainty Seeing and Hearing 

have been lost to consciousness and as  perception consciouscid
ness  has arrived  at thoughts  which it brings  together  for  the 
first  time in the  unconditioned universal  This now if it  were 
taken as an inert simple essence would itselfin turn he nothing 
else than the onesided extreme of beingforselj for it would then 
be  confronted  by  nonessence  but  if it were  related  to  this 
it would itself be unessential and consciousness would not have 
escaped from  the deceptions  of the  perceptual  process  Howcid
ever  this  universal  has  proved  to  be one  which  has  returned 
into  itself out  of such  a  conditioned  beingfarself  This  uncid
conditioned  universal  which  is  now  the  true  object  of concid
sciousness is sti just an object for  it consciousness  has  not yet 
grasped the Notion of the unconditioned as Notion  It is  essential 
to distinguish the two for consciousness the object has returned 
into itself from  its  relation  to  an  other and  has  thus  become 
Notion  in  principle  but  consciousness  is  not  yet for  itself the 
Notion  and consequently does  not  recognize itself in  that  recid
flected  object  For  us  this  object  has  developed  through  the 
movement of consciousness  in  such  a  way  that consciousness 
is involved in that development and the reflection is  the same 
on both sides Of  there is  only one  reflection  But since  in  this 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

movement consciousness has for its content merely the objective 
essence and not consciousness as such the result must have an 
objective  significance  for  consciousness  consciousness  still 
shrinks away from what has emerged and takes it as  the essence 
in the objective  sense 

  With this the Understanding has indeed superseded its 
own untruth and the untruth of the object  What has emerged 
for it as a result is the Notion of the Truebut only as the implicit 
being of the True which is  not yet Notion or which lacks  the 
bringforself of consciousness  and  which  the  Understanding 
without knowing itself therein lets go its own way  This  truth 
follows  out its own essence so  that consciousness plays no part 
in  its  free  realization  but merely looks  on  and  simply  apprecid
hends it  To begin with  therefore  we must step into its  place 
and be  the  Notion  which  develops  and  fills  out  what  is  concid
tained in the result  It is  through awareness of this  completely 
developed object which presents itself to consciousness as somecid
thing  that  immediately  is  that  consciousness  first  becomes 
explicitly a  consciousness  that comprehends  its  object 

  The result was  the  unconditioned  universal  initially 
in the negative  and abstract sense  that consciousness  negated 
its onesidedN otions  and  abstracted  them in other words  it 
gave them up  But the result has implicitly  a  positive signifi  
cance in it the unity of beingfarself and beingforanother 
is  posited in other words  the  absolute antithesis  is  posited as 
a selfidentical essence At first sight this seems to concern only 
the form of the moments in reciprocal relation but beingforcid
self and beingforanother  are  the content  itself as  well  since 
the  antithesis in its  truth  can  have  no  other  nature  than  the 
one yielded in the result viz  that the content taken in percepcid
tion  to  be  true  belongs in  fact  only to the form  in  the  unity 
of which it is dissolved  This content is likewise universal there 
can  be  no  other  content  which  by its  particular  constitution 
would fail to fall within this unconditioned universality A concid
tent of this kind would be some particular way or other of being 
fm  itself and of being in  relation  to an other  But  in general 
to  be for itself and to be in relation to an other constitutes  the 
nature  and essence  of the  content  whose  truth  consists  in  its 
being unconditionally  universal  and  the  result is  simply  and 
solely  universaL 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 

  But because  this  unconditioned universal is  an  object 
for consciousness there emerges in it the distinction ofform and 
content  and  in  the  shape  of content  the  moments  look  like 
they did  when  they first  presented themselves  on  one side  a 
universal  medium  of many  subsistent  matters  and  on  the 
other side  a  One reflected  into itself  in which  their indepencid
dence  is  extinguished  The  former  is  the  dissolution  of  the 
Things  independence  ie  the  passivity  that  is  a  beingforcid
another the latter is  beingforself  We have  to see  how  these 
moments exhibit themselves in the unconditioned universality 
which is  their essence  It is  dear at the  outset that since  they 
exist only in this universality they are no longer separated from 
one another at all but are in themselves essentially selfsupersedcid
ing aspects and what is posited is only their transition into one 
another 

  One  moment  then  appears  as  the  essence  that  has 
stepped to one side as a universal medium or as the subsistence 
of independent matters But the independence of these  matcid
tersis nothing else than this medium in other words the  uncid
conditioned  universal is  simply and solely  the plurality  of the 
diverse universals of this kind That within itself the  universal 
is  in undivided unity with this  plurality means however  that 
these matters are each where the other is they mutually intercid
penetrate but without coming into contact with one another 
because conversely the manydiverse matters are equally incid
dependent  This also  means  thatthey are  absolutely  porous 
or are sublated This sublation in its turn this reduction of the 
diversity  to  a  pure  beingfoselj  is  nothing  other  than  the 
medium itself  and this is  the independence  of the different matcid
ters  In  oher  words  the  matters  posited  as  independent 
directly pass over into their unity and their unity directly uncid
folds  its  diversity  and  this  once  again  reduces  itself to  unity 
But this movement is  what is called Force  One of its moments 
the dispersal of the independent matters in  their immediate 
being is the expression of Force  but Force taken asthatin which 
they have disappeared  is  Force proper  Force  which has  been 
driven  back  into  itself from  its  expression  First  however  the 
Force which is  driven  back into itself must  express  itself  and 
secondly his still Force remaining within itselfin the expression 
just as  much as  it is  expression  in  this  selfcontainedness 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

When we  thus preserve the  two moments in their immediate 
unity  the  Understanding  to  which  the  Notion  of  Force 
belongs  is  strictly speaking the  Notion  which sustains  the  difcid
ferent moments qua different for in  themselves  they are not supcid
posed  to be different  Consequently  the  difference  exists  only 
in  thought  That is  to say  what has  been  posited  in the  forecid
going is  in the first  instance only  the  Notion  of Force  not  its 
reality  In  point of fact  however  Force  is  the  unconditioned 
universal which is  equally in its  own self what it isfor an  other 
or which contains the difference in its own selffor difference 
is nothing else than beingforanother  In order then that Force 
may in  truth be  it must be  completely set free  from  thought 
it must be posited as  the substance of these differences ie first 
the  substance  as  this  whole  Force  remaining essentially in  and 
for  itself  and  then  its  differences  as  possessing substantial  being  or 
as  moments  existing  on  their own account  Force  as  such  or 
as  driven back into itself  thus  exists  on its  own account as  an 
exclusive One for which the unfolding of the different matters 
is another subsisting essence and thus  two distinct independent 
aspects  are set up  But  Force  is  also  the  whole  ie  it remains 
what it is according to its Notion that is  to say these differences 
remain pure forms  superficial vanishing  moments  Atthe same 
time there would be no difference at all between Force proper 
which has been driven back intoitsefand Force unfolded into 
independent matters if they had no enduring  being  or  there 
would  be  no  Force  if it  did  not exist  in  these  opposite  ways 
But  that  it  does  exist  in  these  opposite  ways  simply  means 
that  the  two  moments  are  at  the  same  time  themselves  incid
dependent  It  is  therefore  this  movement  of the  two  moments 
in  which  they  perpetually  give  themselves  independence 
and  then  supersede  themselves  again  which  we  are  now  to 
consider 

In general it is  clear that this movement is  nothing else than 

the  movement of perceiving  in which the  two sides  the  percid
cipient and what is  perceived are indistinguishably one in the 
apprehension  of the True  and yet each side is  at  the same  time 
equally reflected into  itself  or has a  being of its own  Here these 
two sides are moments afForce theyarejust as much in a unity 
as  this  unity  which appears  as  the  middle  term  over  against 
the independent extremes  is  a  perpetual  diremption  of itself 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 

into just these extremes which exist  only through  this  process 
Thus the movement which previously displayed itselfas the self 
destruction of contradictory Notions here has objective form and 
is  the  movement  of Force  the  outcome  of which  is  the  uncid
conditioned universal as something not objective or as  the inner 
being of Things 

  Force as thus determined since it is conceived as Force 
or as  reflected into  itself  is  one side  of its  Notion  but posited  as 
as u bs tan tial ex treme and moreover with the express character 
of a  One  The subsistence  of the  unfolded  matters outside of 
Force  is  thus  precluded  and  is  something  other  than  Force 
Since it is  necessary  that Force  itself be  this  subsistence  or  that 
it express itself its expression presents itself in this wise  that the 
said other approaches it and solicits it But as a matter offact 
since its expression is necessary what is posited as another essence 
is  in Force itself  We  must  retract  the  assertion  that  Force  is 
posited  as  a One  and that its  essence  is  to  express  itself as  an 
other which approaches it externally Force is rather itself this 
universal  medium in  which  the  moments subsist  as  matters 
or in other words  Force has expressed itself  and what was supcid
posed to be something else soliciting it is  really Force itself  It 
exists therefore now as the medium of the unfolded matters 
But equally essentially it has the form of the supersession of the 
subsisting matters or is  essentially a  One  Consequently  this 
oneness  since  Force  is  posited  as  the  medium  of the  matters 
is now something other thin Force which has this its essence outcid
side  of it  But  since  Force  must  of necessity  be  this  oneness 
which it is  not as  yet posited as  being  this  other  approaches  it 
soliciting  it  to  reflect  itself into  itself  in  other  words  Force 
supersedes its expression But in fact Force is itself this reflectedcid
ness  intoself  or this  supersession  of the  expression  The  onecid
ness  in  the  form  in  which  it  appeared  viz  as  an  other 
vanishes Force is this other itself is  Force that is driven back 
into itself 

  What appears as  an other and solicits  Force  both  to 
expression and toa return in to i tsdf directly proves to be itself 
Force  for  the  other  shows  itself to  he  as  much  a  universal 
medium as  a One and in such a way that each of these forms 
at the  same  time  appears  only  as  a  vanishing  moment  Concid
sequently  Force in that there is  an  other for  it  and it is  for 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

an  other  has  not  yet  altogether  emerged  from  its  Notion 
There are at the same time two  Forces  present  the  Notion  of 
both is  no doubt the same but it has gone forth from  its  unity 
into a duality  Instead of the antithesis remaining entirely and 
essentially only a  moment it seems  by its selfdiremption into 
two wholly independent forces  to have withdrawn from  the concid
trolling uni ty W e have now to see more closel y the implications 
of this  independence 

In the first  place  the second  Force  appears as  the one  that 
solicits  and  moreover  in accordance with its  content  as  the 
universal medium in relation to  the Force characterized as  the 
one  solicited  But  since  the  second  Force  is  essentially  an 
alternation of these two moments and is itself Force it is likewise 
the universal medium only through its being solicited to  be such  and 
similarly too it is a negative unity ie  it solicits the retraction 
of Force into itselfJ  only  through  its heing  solicited to  do  so  Ooncid
sequently this distinction too which obtained between the two 
Forces one of which was supposed tohe the soliciting the other 
the  solicited  Force  is  transformed  into  the  same  reciprocal 
interchange of  the determinatenesses 

  The interplay of the  two Forces  thus  consists  in their 
being determined as  mutually opposed in their being for one 
another in  this determination and in the absolute immediate 
alternation of the determinationsconsistsLe in a  transition 
through  which  alone  these  determinations  are  in  which  the 
Forces seem  to  make  an independent appearance  The soliciting 
Force eg  is  posited as  a  universal medium and the one soli  
cited on the other hand as  Force driven  back into itself  but 
the former is a universal medium only through the other being 
Force that is driven back into itself or it is  really the latter that 
is  the  soliciting  Force  for  the  other and  is  what  makes  it  a 
medium The first Force has its determinateness only  through 
the  other  and solicits  only in so  far  as  the  other solicits  it to 
be  a  soliciting  Force  and just as  directly  it loses  the  detercid
minateness  given  to  it  for  this  passes  overcor  rather  has 
already  passed  overto the  other  The  external  soliciting 
Force appears as a universal medium but only through its havcid
ing heen solicited by the other Force  to do so  but this  means 
that the latter gives it that character and is really itself essentially 
a universal medium itgives the soliciting Force this character 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

just  because  this  other  determination  is  essential  to  it  ie 
because  this  is  really  its  own  self 

  To complete our insight into the  Notion  of this  move a 
ment it may further be  noticed that the differences  themselves 
are  exhibited  in  a  twofold  difference  once  as  a  difference  of 
content one extreme being the Force reflected into itself  but the 
other the  medium  of the  matters  and  again  as  a  difference 
ofjorm since one solicits and the  other is  solicited  the  former 
being active and the other passive  According to  the difference 
of content they  are distinguished  merely  in  principle  or jor 
us but according to the difference ofform they are independent 
and in  their relation keep themselves separate and opposed  to 
one  another  The fact  that the  extremes  from  the standpoint 
of both these sides are thus nothing in themselves  that these sides 
in  whih their different essences  were supposed  to  consist  are 
only vanishing moments are an immediate  transition  of each 
into its opposite  this  truth becomes apparent to  consciousness 
in  its  perception  of the  movement  of  Force  But jor  u  as 
remarked above something more was  apparent  viz  that the 
differences  qua  differences oj emtent  andjorm  vanished in  them  
selves and on the side ofform the essence of the active soliciting 
or independent side  was  the same as  that which  on  the side of 
content  presented  itself as  Force  driven  hack into  itself  the 
side which was  passive  which was solicited or for an other  was 
from  the side  of form the  same  as  that  which  from  the  side 
of content presented itselfas the universal medium of the many 
matters 

  From this we see that the Notion of Force becomes qctual 
through its  duplication into  two  Forces  and  how  it comes  to 
he so These two Forces exist as independent essences but their 
existence is  a  movement of each  towards  the  other  such  that 
their being is  rather a pure positedness  or a  being that is  posited 
by an  other  ie  their being has  really the significance of a sheer 
vanishing  They do not exist as  extremes which retain for  them  
selves  something  fixed  and  substantial  transmitting  to  one 
another in  their  middle  term  and  in  their  contact  a  merely 
external  property  on  the  contrary  what  they  are  they  are 
only in  this  middle  term and  in  this  contact  In  this  there  is 
immediately present both the repression within itself of Force 
or its  beingJorself  as  well  as  its  expression  Force  that solicits 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

and  Force  that is  solicited  Consequently  these  moments  are 
not divided into two independent extremes offering each other 
only an opposite extreme  their essence  rather consists  simply 
and solely in  this  that  each  is  solely  through  the  other  and 
what  each  thus  is  it  immediately  no  longer  is  since  it is  the 
other They have thus in fact no substances of their own which 
might support and maintain them The  Notion  of Force rather 
preserves itself as the ssence in its very actuality  Force as  actual 
exists simply and solely in its expression  which at the same time 
is  nothing else  than  a  supersession  of itself  This  actual  Force 
when  thought of as  free  from  its  expression  and  as  being  fr 
itself  is  Force  driven  back  into itself  but in  fact  this  deter 
minateness as we have found is itself only a moment of Forces 
expression Thus the truth of Force remains only the thought  of 
it the moments ofits actuality their substances and their move 
ment  collapse  unresistingly into  an  undifferentiated  unity  a 
unity which is not Force driven  back into itsef for this is itself 
only such a moment but is its Notion qua Notion  Thus the realcid
ization of Force is  at the same  time  the loss  of reality in that 
realization it has really become something quite different viz 
this universality  which the Understanding knows at the outset 
or immediately  to  be its  essence and  which also  proves  itself 
to  be such in the supposed reality  of Force  in the actual subcid
stances 

  In so far as  we regard thefirst  universal as  the  Undercid

standings Notion  in which Force is  not yetfr itself  the second 
is  now  Forces essence  as  it exhibits  itself in  and  for  itself  Or 
conversely  if we  regard  the  first  universal  as  the  Immediate 
which was supposed to be an actual object for consciousness then 
this second is determined as the negative of Force that is objective 
to sense  it is  Force in  the form  of its  true  essence  in which it 
exists only as  an obJect for  the  Understanding  The first  universal 
would be  Force driven back into itself  or Force as  Substance 
the second however is the inner being of things qua inner which 
is  the same as  the  Notion of Force qua  Notion 

  This  true essence  of Things  has  now  the  character  of 
not being immediately for consciousness on the contrary con 
sciousness  has  a  mediated  relation  to  the  inner  being and  as 
the Understanding looks  through  this  mediating play of Forces  into 
the  true  hackground of Things  The middle term which unites  the 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

two  extremes  the  Understanding and  the  inner world  is  the 
developed  being  of Force  which  for  the  Understanding itself 
is  henceforth only a vanishing This  being is  therefore  called 
appearance  for  we  call  being  that is  directly and  in its  own self 
a nonbeing  a surface show  But it is  not merely a surface show 
it is  appearance  a  totality  of show  This  totality  as  totality  or 
as a universal is what constitutes the inner of Things the play 
of Forces as a reflection of the inner into itself  In it  the Things 
of perception are expressly present for consciousness as  they are 
in themselves viz  as  moments which immediately and without 
rest or stay turn into their opposite the One immediately into 
the  universal  the  essential  immediately into  the  unessential 
and  vice  versa  This  play  of Forces  is  consequently  the  decid
veloped negative but its truth is  the positive  viz  the universal 
the object that in itself possesses being The being of this object 
for  consciousness  is  mediated  by  the  movement  of appearance 
in which the being  of perception  and the sensuously objective in 
general  has  a  merely  negative  significance  Consciousness 
therefore reflects itself out of this  movement back into itself as 
the True but qua consciousness converts this  truth again into 
an  objective  inner  arid  distinguishes  this  reflection  of Things 
from  its  own  reflection  into  itself  just  as  the  movement  of 
mediation is  likewise still  objective for  it  This inner is  therecid
fore  for  consciousness  an extreme over against it  but it is  for 
consciousness the True since in the inner as  the initself it poscid
sesses  at the same  time the  certainty  of itself  or  the  moment 
of its  beingforself But it is  not  yet  conscious  of this  ground 
or basis  for  the beingforselfwhich  the inner was  supposed  to 
possess  in  its  own  self would  be  nothing else  but  the  negative 
movement This however is  for consciousness still the objective 
vanishing  appearance  not  yet  its  own  beingforself  Concid
sequently  the  inner is  for  it certainly Notion  but it does  not 
as  yet know  the  nature of the  Notion 

  Within this inner truth  as  the absolute  universal  which has 

been purged of the antithesis between  the  universal  and theincid
dividual and has become the object of the  Understanding  there 
now opens up above  the  sensuous  world  which  is  the world  of 
appearance  a  supersensible  world  which  henceforth  is  the  true 
world  above  the  vanishing  present  world  there  opens  up  a 
permanent beyond  an initself which is  the first  and  therefore 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

imperfect appearance of Reason or only the pure element in 
which  the  truth has its  essence 

  Our object is  thus from now on  the  syllogism  which  has 

for its extremes the inner being of Things and the  Understandcid
ing and for  its  middle  term  appearance  but  the  movement 
of this syllogism  yields  the further  determination  of what  the 
Understandingdescries in this inner world through the middle 
term  and  tlJe  experience  from  which  Understanding  learns 
about the closelinked  unity of these  terms 

  The inner world is for consciousness still a pure  beyond 
because consciousness does not as yet find itselfin it It is empty 
for  it is  merely the  nothingness  of appearance  and  positively 
the  simple  or  unitary  universal  This mode  of the  inner  being 
of Things  finds  ready acceptance  by those who say  that  the 
inner  being of Tings is  unknowable  but another  reason  for 
this would have t be given  Certainly we have no knowledge 
of this inner world as it is here in its immediacy bu t not because 
Reason is  too shortsignted  or is  limited  or however  else  onc 
likes  to call iton  this  point we know  nothing as  yet because 
we have pot yet gone deep enoughbut because of the simple 
nature of the matter in  hand that is  to say because in the void 
nothing is known or expressed from theothersidejust because 
this  inner world  is  determined  as  the  beyond of consciousness 
The result is  of course  the same ira blind man is  placed amid 
the  wealth  of the  supersensible  world  if it  has  such  wealth 
whether it be its own peculiar content of whether consciousness 
itself be  this  content  and if one  with sight is  placed  in  pure 
darkness or if you like in pure light just supposing the supercid
sensible world  to  be  this  The man with sight  sees  as  little  in 
that pure  light  as  in  pure darkness  and just as  much  as  the 
blind  man  in  the abundant wealth which  lies  before  him  If 
no further significance attached to  the inner world and  to our 
close link with it tlrough the world of appearance then nothing 
would he left to us  but to stop at the world of appearance  ie 
to  perceive something as  true which we  know  is  not  true  Or 
in order that there may yet be something in the  voidwhich 
though it first  came  about as  devoid  of objective  Things  must 
however as  empty  in  itself  be taken as  also  void  of all  spiritual 
relationships  and  distinctions  of consciousness  qua  consciouscid
nessin  order  then  that in  this  complete  void  which  is  even 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
called the holy  oj holies  there  may yet be something  we  must 
fill  it up  with reveries  appearances  produced by consciousness 
itself  It would have  to be content with being treated so  badly 
for it would not deserve anything better since even reveries are 
better than its  own  emptiness 

  The inner  world  or supersensible  beyond  has  howcid

ever come into being it comesjrom the world pf appearance which 
has mediated it in other words appearance is  its essence  and 
in fact its filling  The supersensible is  the sensuous and the percid
ceived posited as it is  in  truth  but the truth  of the sensuous  and 
the perceived is  to be appearance  The supersensible is  therefore 
appearance  qua  appearance  We completely  misunderstand  this  if 
we  think that the supersensible world is  therefore  the  sensuous 
world  or the  world  as  it exists  for  immediate sense  certainty 
and perception for the world of appearance is on the contrary 
not  the  world  of senseknowledge  and  perception  as  a  world 
that positively is  but  this  world  posited  as  superseded  or as 
in  truth an  inner  world  It is  often  said  that  the  supersensible 
world is not appearance but what is here understood by a ppearcid
ance is  not appearance  but rather the sensuous  world  as  itself 
the  really actuaL 

  TheUnderstanding which is  our object finds  itself in 
just this  position  that the inner world has come into being for 
it  to  begin  with  only as  the  universal  still  unfilled  initself 
The play of Forces has merely this negative significance of being 
in  itself nothing and its only positive significance that of being 
themedirJtingagency but outside of the Understanding The concid
nection of the Understanding with the inner world through the 
mediation is  however  its  own  movement through which  the 
inner world will  fill  itself out for  the  Understanding  What is 
immediate for the Understanding is  the play of Forces  but what 
is  the  True for it is  the simple inner world  The  movement of 
Force  is  therefore  the  True  likewise  only  as  something  altocid
gether simple  We have seen however  that this  play of Forces 
is  so  constituted  that the  Force  which  is  solicited  by  another 
Force is  equally the soliciting  Force for  that other  which only 
thereby becomes itself a soliciting Foree What is present in this 
interplay is  likewise  merely the immediate alternation  or the 
absolute interchange of the determinateness which constitutes the 
sole content of what appears  to  be  either a  universal  medium 

go 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

or a  negative  unity  It  ceases  immediately  on  its  appearance 
in determinate form to be what it was on appearing by appearcid
ing in determinate form it solicits the other side to express itself 
ie  the latter is  now  immediately what the first  was supposed 
to be  Each of these  two sides  the relation  of soliciting  and  the 
relation  of the opposed determinate content is  on  its own  account 
an absolute reversal and interchange of the determinateness 
But these two relations themselves are again one and the same 
and the difference ofform of being the solicited and  the solicitcid
ing Force is  the same as  the difference of content  of being the 
solicited  Force  as  such  viz  the  passive  medium  on  the  one 
hand nd the soliciting Force the active negative unity or the 
One  on  the  other  In  this  way  there  vanishes  completely  all 
distinction  of separate  mutually  contrasted  Forces  which  were 
supposed to be present in this movement for they rested solely 
on those  distinctions  and  the distinction  between  the  Forces 
along with both those distinctions likewise  collapses  into only 
one  Thus  there  is  neither  Force  nor  the  act  of soliciting  or 
being  solicited  nor  the  determinateness  of  being  a  stable 
medium and a  unity reflected into itself  there is neither somecid
thing existing singly by itself  nor are there  diverse  antitheses 
on the contrary what there is  in  this  absolute flux  is  only dif
ference  as a universal difference aras a  difference into which the 
many antitheses have been resolved  This difference  as  a  unicid
versal difference is  consequently the simple  element  in  the play  of 
Force  itself and what is  true in  it  It is  the  law  of Force 

 The absolute flux  of appearance becomes  a  simple  dif
ference  through its relation to the simplicity of the  inner world 
or of the Understanding The inner being is to begin with only 
implicitly  the  universal  but  this  implicit  simple  universal  is 
essentially no less  absolutely universal  difference  for it is  the  out 
come of the flux  itself or the flux is its essence  but it is  a  flux 
thatis posited in the inner world as it isin truth and consequently 
it is received in that inner world as equally an absolute univercid
sal difference that is absolutely at rest and remains selfsame  In 
other words  negation is  an essential  moment of the  universal 
and negation or mediation in  the  universal is  therefore a  unicid
versal  difference  This  difference  is  expressed  in  the  law  which 
is  the stable  image of unstable  appearance  Consequently  the 
supersensible world is an inert realm of laws which though beyond 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
the perceived worldfor this exhihits law only through incesscid
ant  changeis  equally present  in  it  and  is  its  direct  tranquil 
image 

  This  realm  of laws  is  indeed  the  truth for  the  Undercid

standing and that truth has its content in the law  At  the same 
time however this realm is only the initial truth for the Undercid
standing and does not fill  out the world of appearance  In this 
the law is present hut is not the entire presence of appearance 
with every change of circumstance the law has a different actucid
ality  Thus appearance retainsfor itselfan  aspect which is  not 
in the inner world  ie  appearance is  not yet  truly posited as 
appearance  as  a  superseded heingforself  This  defect in the law 
must equally  he  made manifest in  the law itself  What seems 
to he defective in it is  that while it does contain difference  the 
difference is  universal indeterminate  However in so  far as  it 
is not law in general but a law it does contain determinateness 
consequently there are indefinitely many laws But this plurality 
is  itself rather a  defect for  it  contradicts  the  principle of the 
Understanding for which as  consciousness of the simple inner 
world the True is  the implicitly universal unity  It must therecid
fore  let the  many laws collapse into one  law just as  eg  the 
law hy which a stone faUs  and the law hy which the heavenly 
bodies move have been grasped asonelaw But when the laws 
thus  coincide  they  lose  their  specific  character  The  law 
becomes  more  and  more superficial  and  as  a  result  what  is 
found is  in fact  not the unity of these  specific  laws  but a  law 
which  leaves  out  their specific  character just as  the  one  law 
which combines in its elf the laws off aIling terrestrial bodies and 
of the motions of the heavenly bodies in fact expresses neither 
law  The unification  of all laws  in universal  attraction  expresses 
no  other content than just the  mere  Notion  of law  itself  which 
is  posited in that law in the form of being  Universal attraction 
merely asserts that everything has a constant difference  in  reltion  to 
other  things  The  Understanding imagines  that in  this  unificacid
tion  it  has  found  a  universal  law  which  expresses  universal 
reality as  such  but in fact  it hs only found  the  Notion  of law 
itself  although in such a  way that what it is  saying is  that all 
reality is in its own self conformable to law The expression unicid
versal attraction  is  of great importance in so  far  as  it is  directed 
against the thoughtless way in which everything is  pictured as 

 
contingent and for which determinateness has the form of sencid
suous  independence 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

  Thus  in  contrast  to  specific  laws  we have  universal 
attraction  or  the  pure  Notion  of law  In  so  far  as  this  pure 
Notion is looked on as  the  essence  or the  true inner being  the 
determinateness  of the  specific  law itself still  belongs  to  appear 
ance  or rather to sensuous  being  But  the  pure  Notion  of law 
transcends not merely the law which being itself a specific law 
stands contrasted with other specific laws  but also  transcends 
law  as  such  The  determinateness  of which  we  spoke  is  itself 
really only a vanishing moment which can no longer occur here 
as something essential for here it is only the law that is the True j 
but the Notion oflaw is  turned against law  itself  That is  to say 
in the law the difference itself is  grasped immediately and  taken 
up into the  universal  thereby  however  giving  the  moments 
whose relation is  expressed  by the law a  subsistence  in  the  form 
of indifferent  and  merely  implicit  essentialities  But  these 
parts of the difference  present in  the law are at the same  time 
themselves  determinate sides  the  pure Notion of Jaw  as  unicid
versal  attraction  must  to  get its  tfuemeaning  be  grasped  in 
such a way that in it  as  what is  absolutely simple  or unitary 
the differences present in law as  such  themselves  return again 
into theinnerworld as a simple unity  This uni ty is  the inner necessity 
of the law 

  Thelawis therebypresentin atwofod manner once as 

law in which the differences are expressed as independent momcid
ents andalsoin the form of a simple withdrawal in to itself which 
again can be called Force  but in the sense not of a  Force that is 
drivenbackintoitself butForceassuch or theNotion of Force  an 
abstraction  which  absorbs  the differences  themselves  of what 
attracts and what is  attracted  In  this  sense  simple  electricity 
eg  is  Force  but the  expression  of difference  falls  within  the 
law  this  difference  is  positive  and  negative  electricity  In the 
case of the motion of falling  Force  is  the simple factor  gravity 
w hose  law  is  that the  magnitudes  of the  differen t  momen ts  of 
the motion the time elapsed and the space traversed are relatd 
to one another as  root and square  Electricity itself is  not difcid
ference per se oris not in its essence  the dual essence of positive 
and negative electricity hence it is  usually said that it has  the 
law  of this  mode  of being  and  too  that  it has  the  property  of 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
expressing itselfin this  way  It is  true  that this  property is  the 
essential  and  sole  property of this  Force  or that it  belongs  to 
it necessarily  But necessity here is  an empty word  Force must 
just because it must  duplicate itself in this way  Of course given 
positive electricity negative too is given in principle  for  the posi  
tive  is  only  as  related  to  a  negative  or  the  positive  is  in  its 
own self the difference from itself  and similarly with the nega a 
tive But that electricity as such should divide itself in this  way 
is not in itselfa necessity Electricity as simple Force is indifferent 
to its lawto be positive and negative and if we call the former 
its Notion but the latter its  being  then its  Notion is  indifferent 
to its  being  It merely has  this property which just means that 
this  property is  not in  itself necessary to it  This  indifference is 
given another form when it is said that to be positive and nega  
tive belongs to the definition of electricity and that this is  simply 
its Notion and essence  In that case its  being would simply mean 
its  actual  existence  But  that  definition  does  not  contain  the 
necessity  of its existence  it exists  either because we find  it  i e  its 
existence is  not necessary at all  or else it exists  through  or by 
means of other Forces ie its necessity is an external necessity 
But  in  basing this  necessity  on  the  determinateness  of being 
through another we relapse again into the plurality of specific laws 
which we have just left behind in order to consider law  as  law 
It is  only  with  law  as  law  that we  are  to  compare  its  Notion 
as  Notion or its  necessity  But in all  these forms  necessity has 
shown itself to  be only  an empty word 

I  There is  still another form  than  that just indicated in 
which the indifferenceoflaw and Force or of Notion and being 
is  to  be  found  In  the law  of motion  eg  it is  necessary  that 
motion be split up into time and space or again into distance 
and velocity  Thus since motion is  only  the  relation  of these 
factors ittheuniversalis certainly divided in its own self But 
now  these  parts  time  and space  or distance  and velocity  do 
not in  themselves  express  this  origin  in  a  One  they  are  incid
different to one another space is  thought of as  able to be with  
out  time  time  without  space  and  distance  at  least  without 
velocityust  as  their  magnitudes  are  indifferent  to  one 
another since they are not related to one another as positive and 
negative  and thus  are  not related  to  one  another through their 
own essential nature  The necessity of the division  is  thus certainly 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
present here but not  the  necessity  of the parts  as  such for  one 
another  But it is  just for  this  reason  that  that  first  necessity 
too is itself only a sham false  necessity  For motion is  not itself 
thought  of as  sorpething simple  or  as  a  pure  essence  but  as 
already  divided  time and splce  are  in  themselves  its  independent 
parts or essences  Of distance and velocity are  modes  of being 
or ways  of thinking  either of which  can  well  be  without  the 
other and motion is  therefore  only their superficial  relation 
not their essence  If it is  thought of as  a  simple  essence  or  as 
Force motion is no doubt gravity but this does not contain these 
differences  at all 

  The  difference  then  in  both cases  is  not a  difference 
in  its  own  self  either  the  universal  Force  is  indifferent to  the 
division  which is  the law  or the differences  the  parts  Df  the 
law are indifferent to  one another  The Understanding  howcid
ever has the Notion of this impliczt differencejust because the law 
is on the one hand the inner implicit being but is  at the same 
time  inwardly differentiated  That  this  difference  is  thus  an 
innerdifferencefoUows from the fact that the law is a simple Force 
or is  the  Notion  of the  difference  and is  therefore  a  difference 
belonging    the  Notion  But this  inner difference still falls  to 
begin  with  only  within  the  Understanding  and  is  not  yet 
posited in  the  thing  itself  tis therefore  only its  ow necessity 
that is  asserted by the  Understanding  the difference  then  is 
posited  by the Understanding in such a  way that at the same 
time it is  expressly stated that the  difference is  not a  difference 
belonging to the thing itself  This necessity which is  merely verbal 
is  thus  a  recital  of the  moments  constituting  the  cycle  of the 
necessity  The  moments  are indeed distinguished  but  at  the 
sametime their difference is expressly said to be nota difference 
of the thing itself  and consequently is  itself immediately cancid
celled again This process is called explanation  A law is  enuncicid
ated  from  this  its  implicitly  universal  element  or  ground  is 
distinguished  as  Force  but it is  said  that  this  difference  is  no 
difference  rather  that  the  ground  is  constituted  exactly  the 
same  as  the  law  The  single  occurrence  of lightning  eg  is 
apprehended as  a  universal  and  this  universal  is  enunciated 
as  the  law  of electricity  the  explanation  then  condenses  the 
law  into Force  as  the essence of the law  This  Force  then  is  so 
constituted that when it is expressed opposite eJectricities appear 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
which disappear again into one  another  that is  Force  is  concid
stituted exactly  the  same  as  law  there is  said  to  be  no  difference 
whatever between them The differences are the ure universal 
expression oflaw and pure Force but both have the same  concid
tent  the  same  constitution  Thus  the difference  qua  difference 
of content  of the  thing  is  also  again withdrawn 

  In this tautological movement  the  Understanding  as 
we haveseen sticks to the inert unity ofits object and the movecid
ment falls  only within the Understanding itself not within the 
object It is an explanation that not only explains nothing  but 
is so plain that while it pretends to say something different from 
what has already been said  really says  nothing at all  but only 
repeats the same thing  In the Thing itself this  movement gives 
rise  to  nothing  new  it  comes  into  consideration   only  as  a 
movement of the Understanding In it however we detect the 
very thing that was  missing in  the law  viz  the  absolute  flux 
itself  for  this  movement  when  we  look  at  it  more  closely  is 
directly the opposite of itself Thatis to say it posits a difference 
which is not only nota difference for us but one which the move 
ment itself cancels as a  difference  This is  the same flux  which 
presented  itself as  the  play of Forces  This  contained  the  discid
tinction  of soliciting  and solicited  Force  or  Force  expressing 
itselfand Force repressed into itself but these were distinctions 
which in  reality were  no distinctions  and  therefore  were  also 
immediate y cancelled again What is presen t here is not merely 
bare unity in which no  difference  would  be posited  but rather a 
movement in which a distinction  is  certainly  made  but  because it is 
no distinction is again cancelled  In the process then of explaincid
ing  the  to  and  fro  of change  which  before  was  outside  of 
the inner world and present only in the appearance has penecid
trated  into  the  superselsible  world  itself  Our  consciousness 
however has passed over from the inner heing as object to the 
other  side  into  the  Understanding  and  it  experiences  change 
there 

  Thus this change is  not yet a  change of the thing itself 
but rather presents itself as  pure change  by  the  very Hict  that 
the content of the moments of change remains the same Butsince 
the Notion  qua Notion of the Understanding is  the same as  the 
inner being of things this change becomes for the Understanding 
the law of the inner world  The Understanding thus learns that 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
it is  a  law  of appearance  itself  that  differences  arise  which  are 
no differences  or that what is  selfsame  repels  itself from  itself 
and similarly that the differences are only such as are in reality 
no differences  and  which  cancel  themselves  in other  words 
what is  not selfsame  is  selfatractive And  thus  we  have  a  second 
law whose content is the opposite of what was previously called 
law viz  difference which remains constantly selfsame for this 
new  law  expresses  rather  that  like  becomes  unlike  and  unlzke 
becomes like  The Notion  demands of the  thoughtless  thinker 
that he  bring both laws  together  and  become  aware  of their 
antithesis  The second  is  certainly  also  a  law  an  inner  selfcid
identical being  but a selfsameness  rather of the  unlike  a  percid
manence  of impermanence  In  the  play  of  Forces  this  law 
showed  itself to  be  precisely  this  absolute  transition and pure 
change the selfsame viz  Force splits into an antithesis which 
at first appears to be an independent difference  but which in 
fact proves to be none for it is the selfsame which repels its elf from 
itself and therefore w hatis repelled is essentially selfattractive 
for itis the same the difference created since it is no difference 
therefore  cancels  itself again  Consequently  the  difference 
exhibits itself as difference of the  thing  itself or as  abso ute difcid
ference and this difference of the thing is  thus nothing else but 
the selfsame  that has  repelled  itself from  itself  andtherefore 
merely posits  an antithesis  which is  none 

  Through  this  principle  the  first  supersensible  worJd 
the  tranquil kingdom of laws  the immediate copy of the  per 
ceived  world  is  changed  into  its  opposite  The  law  was  in 
general like its differences  that which remains selfsame now 
however it is  posited that each of the two worlds  is  really the 
opposi te of itself  The selfsame really repels i tselffrom itself and 
what is  not selfsame really posits  itselfas selfsame  In  point of 
fact it is only when thus determined that the difference is  inner 
difference or the difference in  its own self  thelike being unlike 
itself  and the unlike like  itself  This second supersensible  world is 
in  this  way the inverted world and  moreover since  one  aspect 
is already present in the first supersensible world the inversion 
of the first  With this  the inner world is  completed as  appearcid
ance  For  the  first  supersensible  world  was  only  the  immediate 
raising of the perceived world into the universal element it had 
its  necessary  counterpart  in  this  perceived  world  which  stiH 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 

retained for  itself the  principle  of change  and  alteration  The  first 
kingdom of laws lacked that principle but obtains it as  an incid
verted  world 

  According then to the law of this inverted world what 
is  like  in  the  first  world  is  unlike  to  itself  and what is  unlike  in 
the first world is  equally unlike to  itself  or it becomes  like  itself 
Expressed  in  determinate  moments  this  means  that what in 
the  law of the  first  world  is  sweet  in  this  inverted  initself is 
sour what in the former is  black is  in  the  other  white  What 
in  the law of the first  is  the north pole  of the  magnet is  in  its 
other supersensible initself viz  in the earth thesouth pole 
but what is  there south pole isere north pole  Similarly what 
in the first  law is  the oxygen  pole of electricity  becomes  in its 
other  supersensible  essence  hydrogen  pole  and  conversely 
what is  there the hydrogen pole becomes here the oxygen pole 
In another sphere  revenge  on  an enemy is  according  to  the 
immediate law  the supreme satisfaction of the injured individucid
ality  This law however which bids me confront him as  himcid
self a  person who does  not treat me  as  such  and  in  fact  bids 
me destroy him as an individualitythis law is  turned round  by 
the principle of the other world into its opposite  the reinstatecid
mentofmyselfas a  person through the destruction of the lien 
individuality  is  turned  into  selfdestruction  If  now  this  incid
version which finds  expression in the punishment o crime is 
mde into a law it too again is only the law of one world which 
is  confronted by an inverted supersensible world where  what is 
despised in the former  is  honoured  and what in  the former is 
honoured meets with contempt The punishment which under 
the law ofthejirst world disgraces and destroys a  man is  transcid
formed in its inverted world into the pardon which preserves his 
essential  being and brings  him to  honour 

  Looked at superficially this inverted world is the oppocid

site  of the first  in  the sense  that it has  the  latter outside  of it 
and repels that world from itself as an inverted actual world  that 
the one is  appearance but the other the initself  that the one 
is  the world as  it is  for an other whereas  the other is  the world 
as  it is  for  itself  So  that  to  use  the  previous  examples  what 
tastes sweet is  really  or inwardly in the  thing  sour or what is 
north  pole in  the actual  magnet in  the  world  of appearance 
would be south pole in the inner or essential being  what presents 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
itself as  oxygen  pole  in  the  phenomenon  of electricity  would 
be hydrogen  pole  in  unmanifested  electricity  Or  an  action 
which in the world  of appearance  is  a  crime  would  in the inner 
world  he  capable of being really  good  a  bad action  may  be 
wellintentioned  punishment is  punishment only  in  the  world 
of appearance  in  itself  or in another world  it may be a  benefit 
for  the  criminal  But  such  antitheses  of inner  and  outer  of 
appearance and the supersensible as  of two different kinds  of 
actuality we no longer find here  The repelled differences  are 
not shared afresh between two substances such as would support 
them and lend  them a  separate subsistence  this  would  result 
in the  Understanding withdrawing from  the inner world  and 
relapsing into its previous position The one side or substance 
would  be  the  world  of perception  again  in  which  one  of the 
two laws would  be operative  and confronting it would  be an 
inner worldjust such a senseworld as  the first  but in the imaginacid
tion  it could  not be exhibited as  a  senseworld could not  be 
seen heard or tasted  and yet it would  be thought of as  such 
a senseworld Butin fact if the one posited world is  a  perceived 
world  anditsinitsef  as  its  inversion  iseq ually  thought  of as 
sensuous  then sourness which would be  the initself of the sweet 
thing is  actually a  thing just as  much as  theJatter  viz  a  sour 
thing  black which would be the initself of white is  an actual 
black the north pole which is  the initself of the south  pole is 
the north pole actually present in the same magnet  the oxygen pole 
which is  the initself of the  hydrogen pole  is  actually  present  in 
the same voltaic pile The actual crime however has its inversion 
and its  initself as  possibility in theintenon  as  such  but not in 
a good intention for the truth of intention is  only the act itself 
But the crime as regards its content has its  reflectionintoself 
or its inversion in  the actual punishment this is  the reconciliacid
tion of the law with  the  actuality opposed  to it in  the  crime 
Finally the actual punishment has its  inverted actuality present 
in it in such a  way that  the  punishment is  an  actualization of 
the law whereby the activity exercised  by  the  law as  punishcid
ment suspends  itseljand  from  being  active  the  law  becomes 
again quiescent and is vindicated and the conflict of individ ucid
ality  with  it  and of it with individuality  is  extinguished 

  From theidea then of inversion which constitutes the 
essential  nture  of one  aspect  of the  supersensible  world  we 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
must eliminate the sensuous idea of fixing  the  differences  in  a 
different sustaining element and this absolute Notion of the difcid
ference must be represented and understood purely as inner difcid
ference a repulsion of the selfsame as selfsame from itself and 
likeness of the unlike as  unlike  We have to  think pure change 
or think  antithesis within  the  antithesis itself  or contradiction  For in 
the difference which is  an inner difference  the opposite is  not 
merely one of twoif it were it would simply be  without being 
an oppositebut it is  the opposite of an opposite or the other 
is itselfimmediately present in it Certainly I put the opposite 
here and the other of which it is the opposite there the oppocid
site then is on one side is  in and for itself without the   thee  
But just because I have the opposite herein and for itself it is the 
opposite  of itself  or it  has  in  fact  the  other  immediately 
present ioit Thus the supersensible world which isthe inverted 
world  has  at the same time overarched  the  other world  and 
has it within it it isfor itself the inverted world ie the inversion 
of itself  it is  itself and its  opposite in one unity  Only  thus  is 
it difference  as  inner  difference  or difference  in  its  own  self  or 
difference  as  an infinity 

  We see that through infinity  law completes itself into 
an immanent necessity and all the moments of the world  of 
appearancare taken up into the inner world  That the simple 
character of law is infinity means according to  what we  have 
found  a  thatlt is selfidentical but is also in itself diJIerent  or it 
is the selfsame w hieh repels itself from itselfor sunders itself into 
two  What was  called  smple  Force  duplicates  itself and  through 
its infinity is law b  What is  thus dirempted which constitutes 
the parts thought of as in the law exhibits itselfas a stable existcid
ence and if the parts are considered without the Notion of the 
inner difference then space and time or distance and velocity 
which appear as moments of gravity arejust as indifferent and 
without a necessary relation to one another as  to gravity itself 
or  as  this  simple gravity is  indifferent  to  them  or  again  as 
simple  electricity  is  indifferent  to  positive  and  negative  eleccid
tricity  But  c  through  the  Notion  of inner difference  these 
unlike and indifferent moments space and time etc  are a  dif
ference  which is  no difference  or only a difference of what is  selfcid
same  and  its  essence  is  unity  As  positive  and  negative  they 
stimulate each other into activity and their being is  rather to 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

posit themselves as  notbeing and  to suspend themselves in the 
unity  The two  distinguished  moments  both subsist  they  are 
implicit  and  are  opposites  in  themselves  ie  each  is  the  opposite 
of itself  each  has  its  other  within  it and  they  are  only  one 
unity 

  This  simple  infinity  or  the  absolute  Notion  may  be 

called the simple essence of life  the soul of the world  the  unicid
versal blood whose omnipresence is neither disturbed nor inter  
rupted by any difference  but rather is  itself every difference 
as  also  their supersession it pulsates within itself but does  not 
move inwardly vibrates yet is at rest  It is  selfidentical  for  the 
differences are tautological they are differences that are none 
This selfidentical essence is  therefore related only to itself  to 
itself  implies  relationship  to  an  other  and  the  reiationtQselj 
is rather a selfsundering or in other words that very selfiden ticid
calness  is  an  inner difference  These sundered  moments  are  thus 
in  andJor  themselves  each an  oppositeoj an  other  thus  in each 
moment the  other is  at  the same  time  expressed  or each  is 
not  the opposite  of an  other  but only  a  pure  opposite  and  so 
each is  therefore in  its  own self the opposite  of itself  In other 
words it is nolan opposite at all but is purely for itself a pure 
selfidenticalessence that has no difference in it  Accordingly 
wedonotneed to ask the question still less tothink thatJretting 
over such a question is  philosophy or even that it k a  question 
philosophy cannot answer  the question  viz  How  from  this 
pureessencc how does  difference  or otherness issue jorth  from 
it Fox the division into two moments has already taken place 
difference isexcl uded from  the selfiden tical and set apart from 
it  What was supposed to berhe selfidentical is  thus  already one 
of these  two  moments  instead  of beipg  the  absolute  essence 
That the selfidentical divides itself into two means  therefore 
just aswellthat it supersedes itsdfas already  divided supersedes 
itselfas an otherness  The unity  of which it is  usual  to say that 
difference  cannot issue  from it  is  in  fact  itself one  of the  two 
moments it is the abstraction ofthcsimplicity or unitary nature 
over against  the  difference  But in saying that the  unity is  an 
abstraction  that is  is  only  one of the opposed  moments  it is 
already implied that it is  the dividing of itself  for  if the  unity 
is  a  negative  is  opposed to something then it is  eo  ipso  posited  as 
that which has an antithesis  within  it  The different  moments 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

tor 

of selfsundering and ofhecoming selfidentical are therefore likewise 
only this  movement of selfsupersession  for since the selfidenticid
cal which is  supposed first  to sunder itself or become its oppocid
site is  an abstraction or is  already  itself a sundered moment its 
selfmsundering is therefore a supersession of what it is and therecid
fore  the supersession of its dividedness  Its becoming selfidentical 
is  equally a  selfsundering what becomes  identical with itself 
thereby opposes  itself to its  selfsundering  ie  it thereby puts 
itself on one  side  or rather it becomes  a  sundered  moment 

  Infinity or this absolute unrest of pure selfwmovement 
in  which whatever is  determined in one way or  another  eg 
as  being is  rather the opposite of this determinateness  this no 
doubt  has  been  from  the  start  the  soul  of all  that  has  gone 
before  but it is  in  the  inner  world  that it has  first  freely  and 
dearly shown itself Appearance or the play of Forces already 
displays it hut itisas explanation  that it first freely stands forth 
and in being finally  an object for  consciousness  as  that  which 
it is consciousness is thus selfconsciousness  The Understandings 
explanationis primarily only the description ofwhatsefconcid
sciousness  is  It supersedes  the differences present  in  the law 
differences which ha ve alreadybecome pure differences hut are 
still indifferent and posits them in a single unity in Force But 
this  unifying ofthern is  equally and immediately a  sundering 
for it supersedes the differences and posits the oneness of Force 
only  by  creating  a  new  difference  that  of Law  and  Force 
which however at the same time is  no difference and morecid
over from  the fact that this difference is  no difference  it goes 
on to supersede this difference again since it lets Force be simicid
lady constituted  to  Law  But  this  movement  or  necessity  is 
thus still a  necessity  and  a  movement  of the  Understanding 
Of  the movement as such  is  not the  Understandings object  on 
the  contrary  in  this  movement  the  Understanding  has  as 
objects  positive  and  negative  electricity  distance  force  of 
attraction  and a  thousand  other things  which  constitute  the 
content  of the  moments  of the  movement  The  reasOn  why 
explaining affords so much selfsatisfaction is just because in 
it consciousness is  so  to speak  communing directly with itself 
enjoying only itself  although it seems  to  be  busy  with some 
thing else  it is  in  fact occupied only with itself 

 In the contrary law  as  the  inversion  of the  first  law 

 

A  CONSCIOUSNESS 

or in the inner difference it is  true that infinity itself becomes 
the  object  of the  Understanding  but  once  again  the  Undercid
standing falls short of infinity as such since it again apportions 
to  two  worlds  or to  two substantial  elements  that which is  a 
difference  in itselfthe selfrepulsion  of the  selfsame  and  the 
selfattraction of the  unlike  To  the  Understanding  the  movecid
ment as it is  found in experience  is  here  a  mere  happening 
and the selfsame and the unlike are predicates  whose  essence  is 
an inert subtrate  What is  for  the  Understanding  an  object 
in a  sensuous  covering  is for  us  in  its essential form  as  a  pure 
Notion  This apprehension of the difference as  it is  in  truth  or 
the  apprehension  of infinity  as  such is for  us  or in  itself ie  is 
merely  implicit  The  exposition  of  its  Notion  belongs  to 
Science  but consciousness in  the  way  that it  immediately  has 
thi  Notion  again comes on  the scene  as  a  form  belonging to 
consciousness itself or as  a  new shape of consciousness  which 
does not recognize in what has gone before its own essence but 
looks  on it as  something quite  different  Since  this  Notion  of 
infinity is an object for consciousness thelatter is consciousness 
of a differen ce tha t is noless immediately cancelled consciousness 
is for its  own self  it is  a distinguishing of that which  contains 
np  difference  or  selhconsciousness  I  distinguish  myself  from 
myselfandin doing so I am directly aware that what is  distincid
guished frommyselfis not different from me    the selfsame 
being repel myselffrom myself  but what is  posited as  distinct 
from  me  or as  unlike  me  is  immediately  in  being so  distincid
guished not a distinction for  me  It is  true  that consciousness 
of an  other of an object  in  general is  itself necessarily  selfcid
consciousness  a  reflectednessintoself  consciousness  of itself in 
its otherness  The necessary advance  from  the  previous shapes  of 
consciousness for which their truth was a Thing an other than 
themselves expresses just this  that not only is  consciousness of 
a  thing possible only for a selfconsciousness  but that selfconcid
sciousness  alone is  the  truth of those  shapes  But it is  only for 
us  that this  truth exists  not yet for consciousness But selfconcid
sciousness has at first become simply for itself not yet as a unity 
with consciousness  in  general 

 We see thatin the inner world ofappearance the Undercid

standing in truth comes  to know nothing else  but appearance 
but not in  the shape  of a  play of Forces  but rather that play 

FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

 
of Forces in its absolutely universal moments and in their movecid
ment in fact the Understanding experiences only itself  Raised 
above perception consciousness exhibits itself closed in a  unity 
with  the  supersensible  world  through  the  mediating  term  of 
appearance through which it gazes into this background lying 
behind appearance The two extremes of this syllogism  the 
one of the pure inner world  the other that of the inner being 
gazing into tpis pure inner world have now coincided andjust 
as  they  qua  extremes  have  vanished  so  too  the  middle  term 
as something other than these extremes has also vanished This 
curtain  of appearance hanging before the inner world is therecid
fore drawn away and we have the inner being the  gazing 
into the inner worldthe vision of the undifferentiated selfsame 
being  which  repels  itself from  itself  posits  itself as  an  inner 
being  containing  different  moments  but  for  which  equally 
these moments are immediately not differentselfconsciousness 
It  is  manifest  that behind  the  socalled  curtain  which is  supcid
posed  to  conceal  the  inner world  there is  nothing to be seen 
unless we go behind it ourselves as  much in order that we may 
see as that there may besomething behind there which can be 
seen Butat the same time it is  evidentthat we cannot without 
more ado go straightway behind appearance  For  this  knowcid
ledge ofwhat is thetruth of appearance as ordinarily conceived 
and ofitsinner being is itself only a  result ofa complex movecid
ment whereby the modes of consciousness  meaning  perceivcid
ing and the Understanding vanish and it will be equally evicid
dent that the cognition of what consciousness knows in knowing itself 
requires  a  still  more  complex  movement  the  exposition  of 
which is  contained in  what follows 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

IV  THE  TRUTH  OF  SELFCERTAINTY 

  In the previous modes of certain ty what is  true for concid

sciousness is something other than itself  But the Notion of this 
truth vanishes in  the experience of it  What the object immecid
dia tely was in itselfmere being in sensecertain ty the concrete 
thing  of perception  and  for  the  Understanding  a  Forcecid
proves to be in truth not this at all instead this  initself turns 
out to be a  mode in which the object is  only for an other  The 
Notion of the object is  superseded in  the  actual object or the 
first  immediate presentation of the object is  superseded in excid
perience  certainty  givesplace  to  truth  But  now  there  has 
arisen what did not emerge in these previous relationships viz 
a  certainty which is  iqcn tical with its  truth for  the  certainty 
is to itselfits own object anrlconsciousness is to itself the truth 
In this there is indeedanotherness thatis tosay consciousness 
makes a distinction butane which atthesarne time is for concid
sciousness nota distinction Ifwe give the name of Notion  to the 
movement of knowing and  the  name  of object  to  knowing as 
a  passive  unity or as  the   then we  see  that not only for  us 
but for  knowing  itself  the objectcorrespoQrls  to  the  Notion 
Or alternatively if we  call  Notion what the  object is  in  itself 
but call  the object what zt  is  qua  object or for an  other  then  it 
is clear that beinginitselfand beingforanotker are one and the 
same For the initselfis consciousness but eq ually it is  thatfor 
which  an other the initself  is  and  it is for  consciousness  that 
the initself of the  object  and  the  being  of the  object  for  an 
other  are  one and  the  same  the  I  is  the  content  of the  concid
nection and  the connecting itself  Opposed to an other the  
is  its  own  self  and  at  the  same  time  it  overarches  this  other 
which for  the  I is  equally only  the I itself 

  With  selfconsciousness 

therefore 
entered the native realm of truth We have now to see  how the 
shape of selfcons do us ness first makes its appearance Ifwe concid
sider this  new shape of knowing  the knowing of itself  in  rela

then  we  have 

THE  TR UTH  OF  SELFeER TAINTY 

 
tion to that which preceded viz  the knowing of an other then 
we see that though this other has indeed vanished its moments 
have at the same time no less  been preserved and the loss  concid
sists in this  that here they are present as  they are in themselves 
The r mere  being  of what is  merely  meant  the  singleness  and 
the universality opposed to it of perception as also the empty inner 
being  of the  Understanding  these  are  no  longer  essences  but 
are  moments  of  selfconsciousness  ie  abstractions  or  discid
tinctions which at the same time have no reality for  consciouscid
ness itself and are purely vanishing essences Thus it seems that 
only the  principal  moment itself has  been  lost  viz  the  simple 
selfsubsistent existence for consciousness  But in point of fact selfcid
consciousness is  the reflection  out of the being of the  world of 
sense and perception and is essentially the return from otherness 
As selfconsciousness it is  movement but since what it distincid
guishes from itselfis only seljasitseJf the difference as an othercid
ness is  immediately  superseded for  it  the  difference is  not  and  it 
selfconsciousness  is  only  the  motionless  tautology of  I am 
r blH since for it the difference does not have the form of being 
it is  not selfconsciousness Hence otherness is  for it in  the form 
of a being  or as  a distinct moment  but there is  also forconsdouscid
ness  the  unity  of itself with  this  difference  as  a  seconddZstinct 
momlnt With that firstmoment selfconsciousness is in the form 
of consciousness  and  the  whole  expanse  of the  sensuous  world 
is prserved for it but at the same time only as connected with 
the second moment the unity of selfconsciousness with itself 
and  hence  the senSUOllS  world  is  for  it  an  enduring existence 
Which  however  is  only  lppearance  or a  difference  which  in 
itself  is  no difference  This antithesis of its  appearance and its 
tnlb htls  however for its essence only the truth viz  the unity 
ofselfcousciousness with itself this unity must become essential 
to selfconsciousness ie selfconsciousness is  Desire in general 
Consciousness  as  selfconsciousness  henceforth  has  a  double 
object one is  the immediate object that of sensecertainty and 
perception which howeverfor setfconsciousness has the character 
ofa negative and the second viz  itself  which is  the true essence 
and is  present in the first  instance only as  opposed to  the first 
object  In  this  sphere  seIf  consciousness  exhibits  itself as  the 
movement in which this antithesis is removed and the identity 
of itself with hself becomes  explicit for  it 

 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

  Butforus orin itseifthe object which for selfconsciouscid

ness is  the negative element has on its side returned into itself 
just as  on the other side consciousness  has  done  Through  this 
reflection into itself the object has become Life  What selfconcid
sciousness  distinguishes  from itself as  having being  also has  in 
it  in so  far  as  it is  posited  as  being  not merely the  character 
of sensecertainty and perception but it is being that is reflected 
into itself  and  the object  of immediate desire  is  a  living  thing 
For  the  initself  or  the  universal  result  of the  relation  of the 
Understanding to the inwardness of things is  the distinguishing 
of what is  not to  be distinguished or the unity of what is  distincid
guished But this unity is as we have seenjust as much its repulcid
sion from itself and this Notion sunders itself into the antithesis 
of selfconsciousness  and life  the former is  the unity for  which 
the infinite  unity of the  differences  is  the  latter  however  is 
only this  unity itself so that it is  not at the same timefor itself 
To the extent then that consciousness is independent so too is 
its object hut only implicitly  Selfconsciousness which is  simply 
for itself and directly characterizes its  object  as  a  negative elecid
mentor is primarily desire will therefore on the contrary learn 
through experience  that the  object is  independent 

  The  determination  of Life  as  it has  issued  from  the 
Notion or the general result with which we enter this  sphere 
issuflicient to characterize it without having further to develop 
its nature Its sphere is completely determined in  the following 
moments Essence is infinity as  the supersession  of all distinctions 
the pure movement of axial  rotation  its  selfrepose  being  an 
absolutely restless  infinity  independence  itself  in which the difcid
ferences  of the  movement  are  resolved  the  simple  essence  of 
Time which in  this  eq uality with  itself  has  the  stable shape 
of Space  The differences  however  are just as  much  present 
as differences in this simple universal medium for  this  universal 
flux  has  its  negative  nature ony in  being  the  supersession  of 
them but it cannot supersede  the  different  moments  if they 
do not have an enduring existence Bestehen  Itis this very flux 
as  a selfidentical independence which is  itself an enduring existcid
ence  in which therefore  they are  present as  distinct members 
and parts  existing on  their own account  Being  no  longer  has 
the significance of abstract being nor has  their pure essentiality 
the  significance of abstract  universality  on  the contrary  their 

THE TRUTH  OF  SELFCER TAINTY 

 
being is precisely that simple fluid substance of pure movement 
within  itself  The  difference  however  qua difference  of these 
members with respect to one another consists irt  general in no 
other determinateness  than  that of the  moments of infinity  or of 
the  pure movement itself 

  The independent members  are jor  themselves  but this 
beingjorsef is  really no  less  immediately  their  reflection  into 
the  unity than this  unity is  the  splittingup into  independent 
shapes The unity is  divided within itself because it is  an absocid
lutely negative or infinite unity and because it is  what subsists 
the difference  too has independence only in it  This indepencid
dence of the shape appears as something determinatejor an  other 
for  the shape is  divided  within  itself  and  the  supersession  of 
this dividedness accordingly takes  place through an other But 
this  supersession  is just as  much within  the  shape  itself  for  it 
isjust that flux that is the substance of the independent shapes 
This substance however is infinite and hence the shape in its 
very subsistence is adividedness within itself or the supersession 
of its  beingforself 

  If we ditiqguish more exactly the moments contained 
here we see that we have  as  the first moment the subsistence 
of the independent shapes or the suppression of what dirempcid
tion is in itself viz  that the shapes have no being in themselves 
no enduring existence Thesecond moment however is the subcid
jection of that exis tence to  the infinity of the difference  In the 
first  moment there is  the existent shape  as  beingjor itself  or 
being in its determinateness infinite substance it comes forward 
in antithesis to the universal substance disowns this fluent conticid
nuity with it and asserts that it is  not dissolved in this  universal 
element but on the contrary preserves itself by separating itself 
from this its inorganic nature and by consuming it Life in the 
universal fluid  medium a passive separatingout of the shapes 
becomes  just  by  so  doing  a  movement  of those  shapes  or 
becomes  Life  as  a process  The simple  universal  fluid  medium 
is  the initself  and the difference of the shapes  is  the other  But 
this  fluid  medium  itself becomes  the  other  through  this  difcid
ference for now it isfor the difference which exists in and for itself 
and consequently is  the ceaseless movement by which this pass  
ive  medium is  consumed  Life  as  a  hving  thing 

This inversion  however is  for  that reason again an inverted

B  SELFCONSOIOUSNESS 

 
ness in its own self What isconsumed is the essence the individua 
ality which maintains itself at the expense of the universal  and 
which  gives  itself the feeling  of its  unity with  itself just by  so 
doing supersedes its antithesis  to  the  other by means  of which 
it exists for itself Its selfgiven unity with itselfisjust thatfluidity 
of the differences or their general dissolution  But conversely  the 
supersession  of individual  existence  is  equally  the  production 
of it  For  since  the  essence  of the  individual  shapeuniversal 
Lifeand what exists for itselfis in itselfsimple substance when 
this substance places  the other within itself it supersedes  this  its 
simplicity  or its  essence  ie  it divides  it  and  this  dividedness 
of the differenceless fluid medium isjust what establishes indivia 
duality  Thus  the  simple  substance  of Life  is  the  splittingup 
ofitselfinto shapes and at the same time the dissolution of these 
existent differences  and  the  dissolution  of the  splittingup  is 
just as  much  a  splittingup and  a  forming  of members  With 
this  the  two sides  of the  whole  movement  which  before  were 
distinguished j  viz the passive separatednessofthe shapes in the 
general medium of independence and the  process of Life colcid
lapse into one another The latter is just as  much an imparting 
of shape  asa supersession of it  and  the  other  the  imparting 
of shape  isjustas much asupersessionas an articulation of shape 
The fluid  element is  itself only the abstraction of essence  or it is 
actualonly as shape and its articulation of itself is again a splita 
ting  up of what is  articulated into form  or a  dissolution of it 
It is  the whole round of this  activity  thatconstitutes Life  not 
what was expressed at the outset the immediate continuity and 
compactness of i ts  essence  nor the enduring form  the discrete 
moment existing for  itself  nor the  pure  process  of these  nor 
yet  the simple  takingtogether of these  moments  Life  consists 
rather in being the self  developing whole which dissolves its decid
velopment and  in  this  movement simply preserves  itself 

  Since  we  started  from  the  first  immediate  unity  and 
returned  through the  moments of formation  and of process  to 
the  unity of both  these  moments  and  thus  hack  again  to  the 
original simple  substance  this  reflected  unity  is  different from 
the  first  Contrasted  with  that  immediate  unity  or  that  unity 
expressed  as  a  mere  being  this  second  is  the  universal  unity 
which  contains  all  these  moments  as  superseded  within  itself 
It is  the  simple  genus  which  in  the  movement  of Life  itself 

THE  TRUTH  OF  SELFCERTAINTY 

does not existfor itself qua  this simple determination on  the con a 
trary  in  this  result  Life  points to  something other  than  itself 
viz  to  consciousness  for  which  Life  exists  as  this  unity  or  as 
genus 

  This other Life  however  for  which  the  genus  as  such 
exists and which is genus on its own account viz selfconscious 
ness exists in the first instance for selfconsciousness only as this 
simple essence and has itself as  pure I for object  In the course 
of its  experience which  we  are  now  to  consider  this  abstract 
object will  enrich itself for  the  I and  undergo  the  unfolding 
which we  have seen  in  the sphere  of Life 

  The simple I is  this genus or the simple  universal for 
which  the differences  are  not  differences  only  by  its  being the 
negative  essence  of the  shaped  independent  moments  and  self  
consciousness  is  thus  certain of itself only  by superseding  this 
other that presents itself to selfmconsciousness as an independent 
life  selfconsciousness  is  Desire  Certain of the  nothingness of 
thisother it explicitly affirms  thatthis nothingness isjor it the 
truth  of the  other  it  destroys  the  independent  object  and 
thereby gives  itself the  certainty of itself as  a  true  certainty  a 
certainty which has become explicit for  selfconsciousness itself 
in  an  objective  manner 

  Inthissatisfaction however experience makes it aware 
that the object has its  own  independence  Desireand  the  SeIfR 
certainty obtained  in  its  gratification  are conditioned  by  the 
object for sefa certainty comes from superseding this  other  in 
order that tbis supersession can take  place  here must  be  this 
other  Thus selfconsciousness  by its  negative  relation  to  the 
a bj eet is  unable to s u persedei t i tis really because oftha t relacid
tion  that it  produces  the  object again  and  the  desire  as  well 
I t is  in fact something other than selfconsciousness  that is  the 
essence  of Desire  and  through  this  experience  selfconscious 
ness has itself realized this  truth  But at  the same  time it is  no 
less  absolutely for  itself  and  it  is  so  only  by superseding  the 
object and it must experience its sa tis fac tiOD  foritis the truth 
On account of the independence of the object  therefore it can 
achieve satisfaction only when the object itself effects  the negacid
tion  within  itself  and it  must carry out this  negation  of itself 
in itself for  itis in  itelfthe negative and must bejor the other 
what it  is  Since  the  object is  in  its  own  self negation  and  in 

 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

being so  is  at the same time  independent  it is  consciousness 
In  the sphere of Life  which is  the  object of Desire  negation  is 
present either in  an  other  viz  in  Desire  or  as  a  determinateness 
opposed  to  another indifferent form  or as  the  inorganic  unicid
versal nature of Life  But this  universal independent nature in 
which negation is  present as absolute negation is  the genus  as 
such  or  the  genus  as  selfconsciousness  Selfconsciousness  achieves 
its  satisfaction  only  in  another  selfconsciousness 

  The  notion  of selfconsciousness  is  only  completed  in 
these three moments  a  the pure undifferentiated is its first 
immediate object  b  But this  immediacy is  itself an  absolute 
mediation it is only as a supersession of the independent object 
in other words  it is  Desire  The satisfaction of Desire  is  it  is 
true  the reflection  of selfconsciousness  into itself  Qr  the  cercid
tainty that has become truth  c  But the truth of this  certainty 
is  really a  double reflection  the  duplication of selfconsciouscid
ness Consciousness has for its object one which of its own self 
posits  its  otherness  or  difference  as  a  nothingness  and  in  so 
doing is independent  The differentiated  merely living  shape 
does  indeed  also supersede its independence in  the  process  of 
Life  but it ceases  with its  distinctive difference  to be what it 
is The object of selfconsciousness however is equaUyindepencid
dent in this negativity of itself and thus it isfor itself a  genus 
a  universal fl uid elemen t in the peculiarity of its own separate 
being it is  a  living selfconsciousness 

  A selfconsciousness exists for a selfconsciousness  Only so 
is it in fact selfcoJsciousness  for only in this wa ydoes the unity 
of itself in  its  otherness  become  explicit for  it  The  I  which 
is  the object of its  Notion is  in fact  not  object  the  object  of 
Desire however is  only independent for it is  the universal in 
destructible substance  the  fluid  selfidentical  essence  A  selfcid
consciousness in being an object isjust as  much T  as  object 
With this we already have before us  the Notion of Spirit  What 
still lies ahead for consciousness is  the experience of what Spirit 
isthis absolute substance which  is  the  unity of the  different 
independent  selfconsciousnesses  which  in  their  opposition 
enjoy perfect freedom and independence  r that is  We  and 
We that is I It is in selfconsciousness in the Notion of Spirit 
that consciousness  first  finds  its  turningpoint  where it leaves 
behind it the colourful show of the sensuous hereandnow and 

LORDSHIP AND  BONDAGE 

 

the nightlike void  of the  supersensible  beyond  and  steps  out 
into the spiritual daylight  of the  present 

A  INDEPENDENCE  AND  DEPENDENCE  OF  SELFcid

CONSCIOUSNESS  LORDSHIP  AND  BONDAGE 

  Selfconsciousness exists in and for itself when  and  by 
the  fact  that  it so  exists  for  another  that  is  it  exists  only  in 
being acknow ledged The Notion of this its Jni ty in its d uplicacid
tion embraces many and varied meanings  Its moments  then 
must on the one hand be held strictly apart  and on the  other 
hand must in this differentiation at the same time also be taken 
and known as not distinct or in their opposite significance The 
twofold significance of the distinct moments  has in  the  nature 
of selfconsciousness  to  be infinite  or directly  the  opposite  of 
the determinateness in which it is  posited The detailed exposicid
tion of the Notion of this spiritual unity in its  duplication  will 
present  us  with  the  process  of Recognition 

  Selfconsciousness  is  faced  by  another  selfconsciouscid
ness  it has  come out  of itself  This  has  a  twofold  significance 
first it has lost itself for it finds itself as an other being secondly 
in  doing  so  it  has  superseded  the  other  for  it  does  not  see 
the  other as  an  essential  being  but in  the  other sees  its  own 
self 

IBo  It  must supersede  this  otherness  of itself  This  is  the 
supersession  of the  first  ambiguity  and  is  therefore  itself  a 
second ambiguity  First it must proceed to supersede the other 
independent being in  order thereby to become certain of itself 
as the essentiaJ being secondly in so doing it proceeds to supercid
sede  its  own  self  for  this  other is  itself 

  This ambiguous supersession of i ts ambiguous otherness 
is eq ually an ambiguous return intJ  itself  For firstthrough the 
supersession it receives back its ownself because by supersedcid
ing its otherness it again becomes equal to itself hut secondly 
the other selfconsciousnes equally gives it back again to itself 
for it saw itself in  the  other  but supersedes  this  being of itself 
in  the  other and  thus lets  the other again  go  free 

  Now this movement of selfconsciousness in relation to 
another selfconsciousness has in this  way been represented as 
the action of one  selfconsciousness  but  this  action  of the  one 

 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

has  itself the double significance of being both its  own  action 
and the action of the other as well  For the other is  equally inde M 
pendent and selfcontained and there is  nothing in  it of which 
it is not itself the origin The first does not have the object before 
it merely as it exists primarily for desire  but as something that 
has  an  independent  existence  of its  own  which  therefore  it 
cannot  utilize  for  its  own  purposes  if that object does  not  of 
its own accord do what the first  does  to it  Thus  the movement 
is simply the double movement of the two selfconsciousnesses 
Each sees the other do the same as  it does each does itself what 
it derrlands  of the  other  and therefore  also  does  what  it does 
only in  so  far  as  the  other does  the  same  Action  by  oneside 
only would  be  useless  because  what is  to  happen  can  only be 
brought about by both 

g  Thus  the  action  has  a  double  significance  not  only 
because it is  directed against itself as well as  against the other 
but also  because  it is  indivisibly  the  action  of one  as  well  as 
of the  other 

  In this  movement  we  see  repeated  the  process  which 
presenteditsefas the play of Forces  but repeated now in concid
sclousness  What in  that process  was for  usis  true  here  of the 
extremes  themselves  The  middle  term  is  selfconsciousness 
which  splits  into  the  extremes   and  each  extreme  is  this 
exchanging of its own determinateness and an absolute  transi 
rinn  into the  opposite  Although as  consciousness  it  does  incid
deed come QutQitself yet  though out of itself it is  at the same 
 time kept back within itself isfor itself  and  the self outside it 
is for it  It is  aware that it  at once  is  and is  not  another concid
sciousness and equally that this other isor itself only when it 
supersedes itself as  being for itself  and is  for  itself only in  the 
beingfor  selfQfthe other Each isfqr the other the middle term 
through whieheach mediates itself with itself and  unites  with 
itself  and each is  for  itself  and  for  the  other  an  immediate 
being on its own account which at the same time is  such only 
through  this  mediation  They recognize  themselves  as  mutually 
retOgnizing  one another 

J   We have now to see how the process of this pure Notion 

ofrecognition of the duplicating ofselfconsciousness in its onecid
ness  appear  to  selfconsciousness  At  first  it  will  exhibit 
the side of the inequality of the  two  or the splittingup of the 

LORDSHIP AND  BONDAGE 

 

middle term into the extremes which as extremes are opposed 
to  on another  one  being  oply  recognized  the  other  only 
recogmzzng 

  Selfconsciousness  is  to  begin  with  simple  beingforcid

self  selfequal  through  the exclusion  from  itself of everything 
else  For it  its  essence  and  absolute  object is and  in  this 
immediacy  or in  this  mere  heing  of its  beingforself  it is 
an individual  What is  other for it is  an unessential negatively 
characterized object But the other is  also a selfconsciousness 
one individual is confronted by another individual Appearing 
thus  immediately on the scene  they  are  for  one  another  like 
ordinary objects  independent shapes  individuals submerged in 
the being or immediacy  of Lifefor the object in its immecid
diacy is here determined as Life They arejor each  other  shapes 
of consciousness  which  have  not  yet accomplished  the  move 
ment  of absolute  abstraction  of rootingout  all  immediate 
being  and of being merely the  purely  negative  being  of selfcid
identical  consciousness  in  other words  they  have  not  as  yet 
exposed  themselves  to  each  other  in  the  form  of pure  beingcid
forself  or as sdfconsciousnesses  Each is  indeed certain of its 
own self  but not of the other  and  therefore  its  own  selfcera 
taintystill has no truth For it would have truth only if its own 
beingforself had confronted it as  an independent object  or 
what is the same thing if the object had presented itself as  this 
pure selfcertainty But according to the Notion of recogpition 
this is  possible ony when each is  for  the  other what the other 
is for it  only when each in its own self through its own action 
and again  through  the action  of the other  achieves this  pure 
abstraction of beingforself 

  The presentation of itself however as  the pure abstraccid

tion  of selfconsciousness  consists in showing itself as  the  pure 
negation  of its  objective  mode  or  in  showing  that  it is  not 
attached to any specific existence  not to the individuality comcid
mon to  existence  as such  that  it is  not attached  to  life  This 
presentation is a twofold action action on the part of the other 
and action on its  own part  In so  far  as  itls the action of the 
other  each  seeks  the death  of the  other  But  in  doing so  the 
second kind of action action on its own part is  also  involved 
for the former involves the staking of its own life  Thus the relacid
tion of the two selfconscious individuals is such that they prove 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

themselves  and  each other  through  a  lifeanddeath struggle 
They must engage in this struggle for they must raise their cercid
tainty of being for  themselves  to  truth  both  in  the  case  of the 
other and in their own case And it is only through staking ones 
life  that  freedom  is  won  only  thus  is  it proved  that  for  selfcid
consciousness its essential being is  not just  being not the imcid
mediate  form  in  which  it  appears  not  its  submergence  ill  the 
expanse of life  but rather  that  there  is  nothing present  in  it 
which  could not be regarded  as  a  vanishing  moment  that  it 
is  only  pure  beingjorself  The individual who  has  not  risked 
his  life  may  well  be  recognized  as  a  person  but  he  has  not 
attained to the truth of this recognition as  an independent selfcid
consciousness Similarlyjust as each stakes his own life so each 
mustseek the others death for it values the other no rpore than 
itself its essential being is present to it in the form of an other 
it is  outside  of itself and  must  rid  itself of its  selfexternality 
The other is  an immediate  consciousness  entangled in a  variety 
of relations hips and it must regard its otherness as a pure beingcid
forself or as  an absolute negation 

  This trial by death however does away with the truth 
which was supposed to issue from it  and so  too with the  er
tainty  of self generally  For just as  life  is  the natural  setting of 
consciousness  independence  without  absolute  negativity  so 
death is  the natural negation of consciousness  negation without 
independence which thus remains without the required significid
cance of recognition  Death certainly shows  that  each staked 
his  life  and held it of no account  both  in  himself and  in  the 
other but that isnnt for those who survived this struggle They 
put an end to their consciousness in its alien setting of natural 
existence  that  is  to  say  they  put an  end  to  themseves  and 
are done away with  as  extremes  wanting  to  be for  themselves  or 
to  have an existence of their own But with this  there vanishes 
from  their  interplay  the  essential  moment  of  splitting  into 
extremes  with  opposite  characteristics  and  the  middle  term 
collapses into a  lifeless  unity which is  split into lifeless  merely 
immediate unopposed extremes and the two do not reciproccid
ally give  and  receive  one  another back from  each other conscid
ciously but leave each otherfree only indifferently like things 
Their act is an abstract negation not the negation coming from 
consciousness  which supersedes  in such  a  way  as  to  preserve 

LORDSHIP  AND  BONDAGE 

 
and  maintain  what  is  superseded  and  consequently survives 
its  own supersession 

g  In this experience selfconsciousness  learns  that life  is 
asessential  to  it as  pure selfconsciousness  In immediate selfcid
consciousness  the simple  I  is  absolute  mediation  and  has  as 
its  essential  moment lasting independence  The dissolution  of 
that simple unity is  the result of the first  experience  through 
this  there is  posited a  pure selfconsciousness and a  consciouscid
ness which is not purely for itselfbut for another ie is a merely 
immediate  consciousness  or  consciousness  in  the  form  of 
thinghood  Both moments are essential Since to begin with they 
are unequal and opposed and their reflection into a  unity has 
not yet been achieved they exist as two opposed shapes of concid
sciousness one is the independent consciousness whose essential 
nature is to be for itself the other is  the dependent consciousness 
whose  essential  nature  is  simply  to  live  or  to  be for  another 
The former  is  lord  the other is  bondsman 

I go  The lord is  the  consciousness  that  exists for  itself  but 
no longer merely  the  Notion  of such a  consciousness  Rather 
it is  a  consciousness  existing for  itself which  is  mediated  with 
itself through another consciousness  ie  through a  consciouscid
ness  whose nature it is  to  be bound up with  an existence  that 
is independent or thinghood in general The lor puts himself 
into relation  with  both  of these  moments  to  a  thing  as  such 
the  object  of  desire  and  to  the  consciousness  for  which 
thinghood is  the essential characteristic Andsince he is  a  qua 
the Notion of selfconsciousness an immediate relation of being
forself  put b  is  now at the same time mediation or a  beingcid
forself which is  for  itself only  through  another  he  is  related 
a  immediately to  both  and  b  mediately  to  each  through 
the other  The lord relates himself mediately to the bondsman 
through a being a thing  that is  independent for it is just this 
which  holds  the  bondsman  in  bondage  it  is  his  chain  from 
which he could not break free in the struggle thus proving himcid
self to be dependent to possess  his  independence in  thinghood 
But the lord is  the power over this  thing  for  he  proved in  the 
struggle  that it is  something  merely  negative  since  he  is  the 
power over this thing and this again is the power over the other 
the bondsman it follows that he holds the other in subjection 
Eq ually the lord relates himself mediately to the thing through 

 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

the bondsman the bondsman qua selfconsciousness in general 
also relates himself negatively to  the  thing and  takes  away its 
independence  but at the same  time  the  thing is  independent 
vismavis  the  bondsman whose  negating of it therefore  cannot 
go  the length  of being altogether done  with it to  the  point of 
annihilation in other words  he only works  on it  For the lord 
on  the other hand  the immediate  relation becomes through this 
mediation  the  sheer  negation  of the  thing  or  the  enjoyment 
of it  What desire  failed  to  achieve  he succeeds  in doing  viz 
to have done with the thing altogether and to achieve satisfac 
tion in  the enjoyment of it  Desire  failed  to do  this  because  of 
the things independence but the lord who has  interposed the 
bondsman between it and nimself takes to himself only the decid
pendent aspect of the thing and has  the  pure enjoyment of it 
The aspect of its independence he leaves to the bondsman who 
works  on  it 

  In both of these moments the lord achieves his  recognicid
tion through anotherconsciousness for in them that other concid
sciousnessis expressly something unessential  both by its work  
lngon the thing and by its dependence on a specific existence 
In neither case can it be lord over the being of the  thing and 
achieve absolute negation of it  Here therefore is  present  this 
moment of recognition  viz  that  the  other consciousness sets 
aside its own beingforself and in so doing itself does  what the 
first does to it Similarly the other momenttoo is  present that 
this action of the second is  the firsts  own  action for  what the 
bondsman does is really the action of the lord Thejatters essencid
tial nature is  to exist only for himself  he is  the sheer negative 
power for whom the thing is nothing Thus he is the pure essencid
tial action in this relationship while the action of the bondsman 
is  impure  and  unessential  But  for  recognition  proper  the 
moment is lacking that what thelord does  to the other he also 
does  to  himself  and  what  the  bondsman  does  to  himself he 
should also do to  the other The outcome is  a  recognition  that 
is  one  sided  and  unequal 

  In this  recognition  the  unessential  consciousness  is  for 
the lord the object which constitutes  the  truth  of his  certainty 
of himself  But it is  clear that this  object does  not correspond 
to its  Notion  but rather that the  object in  which  the  lord has 
achieved his lordship has in reality turned out to be something 

LORDSHIP AND  BONDAGE 

 
quite different from  an independent consciousness  What now 
really confronts  him is  not an independent consciousness  but 
a  dependeot one  He is  therefore  not  certain  of beingfor  self 
as  the truth of himself  On the  contrary  his  truth is  in reality 
the  unessential  consciousness  and its  unessential  action 

  The truth  of the  independent  consciousness  is  accordcid

ingly the servile consciousness of the bondsman This it is  true 
appears at first outside of itself and not  as  the  truth of selfconcid
sciousness But just as  lordship showed  that its  essential nature 
is  the reverse of what it wants to be so  too servitude in its  coocid
summation will really turn into the opposite of what it immecid
diately is as a consciousness forced back into itself it will withcid
draw into itself and  be  transformed  into  a  truly  independent 
consciousness 

  We have seen what servitude is only in relation to lord  
ship But it is  a selfconsciousness and we have now to consider 
what as such it is  in and for itself  To begin with servitude has 
the lord for its essential reality hence the truth for it is  the inde  
pendent consciousness  that  is for  itself  However  servitude  is 
not yet aware that this truth is  implicit in it  But it does in fact 
contain  within  itself this  truth  of pure  negativity  and  beingcid
forself for it has experienced this its own essential nature For 
this consciousness has been fearful  not of this or that particular 
thing  or just  at odd  moments  but  its  whole  being  has  been 
seized with dread for it has experienced the fear of death  the 
absolute  Lord  In  that  experience  it  has  been  quite  uncid
manned has trembled in every fibre ofitsbeing and everything 
solid and stable has been shaken to its foundations But this pure 
universal  movement the absolute meltingaway of everything 
stable is the simple essential nature of selfconsciousness absocid
lute negativity pure beingforselj  which consequently is  implicit 
in this consciousness This moment of pure beingforself is  also 
explicit for  the bondsman for in  the lord it exists for  him as  his 
object  Furthermore his  consciousness  is  not  this  dissolution  of 
everything stable merely in principle in his service he  actually 
brings  this  about  Through  his  service  he  rids  himself of his 
attachment to naturaJ existence in every single detail and gets 
rid of it by working on it 

  However the feeling of absolute power both in general 

and in the particular form of service is  only implicitly  this discid
solution and although the fear of the lord is  indeed the begin

ning of wisdom  consciousness is  not therein  aware  that it is  a 
beingforself Through work however the bondsman becomes 
conscious of what he truly is  In the moment which corresponds 
to desire in the lords consciousness  it did seem that the aspect 
of unessential  relation to  the thing fell  to  the Jot  of the  bondscid
man since in that relation the thing retained its independence 
Desire has reserved to itself the pure negating of the object and 
thereby its  unalloyed feeling of self  But that is  the reason why 
this satisfaction is  itself only a fleeting one for it lacks  the side 
of objectivity  and  permanence  Work  on  the  other  hand  is 
desire  held  in  check  fleetingness  staved  off  in  other  words 
work forms  and shapes the thing  The negative relation to  the 
object becomes its form  and something permanent  because  it is 
precisely for the worker that the object has independence This 
negative middle term or the formative activity is at the same time 
the individuality or pure beingforself of consciousness  which 
now  in  the  work  outside  of it  acquires  an  element  of percid
manence  It is  in  this  way  therefore  that  consciousness  qua 
worker comes to see in  the independent being  of the object 
its  own  independence 

B  But the formative activity has not only this positive sigcid
nificance  that in  it  the  pure  beingfor  self of the  servile  COn 
sdousness  acquires  an  existence  it also  has  in  contrast  with 
its first moment the negative significance offear  For in fashcid
ioning  the  thing  the  bondsmans  own  negativity  his  beingcid
forself  becomes an object for him only through his  setting at 
nought  the existing  shape  confronting  him  But  this  objective 
negative moment is none other than the alien being before which 
it has trembled  Now however he destroys this alien negative 
moment  posits  himself as  a  negative  in  the  permanent order 
of things and thereby hecomesfor himself  someone existing on 
his own account In the lord the beingforself is  an other for 
the bondsman or is  only for him  Le  is  not his  own in fear 
the beingforselfis present in the bondsman himself infashion M 
iog the thing  he becomes aware that beingforself helongs  to 
him  that  he  himself exists  essentially  and  actually  in  his  own 
right The shape does not become something other than himself 
through being made external to him forit is precisely this shape 
that is  his  pure beingforself  which in  this  externality is  seen 
by him to be the truth Through this  rediscovery of himself by 

FREEDOM OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 
himself  the  bondsman  realizes  that it is  precisely in  his  work 
wherein he seemed to  have only an alienated existence that he 
acquires a mind of his own For this reflection the two moments 
of fear  and service as such  as  also  that  of formative  activity 
are necessary both being at the same time in a universal mode 
Without the  discipline  of service and obedience fear  remains 
at the formal stage and does not extend to the known real world 
of existence  Without the formative  activity  fear  remains  incid
ward and mute and consciousness does  not become explicitly 
for itself If consciousness fashions  the thing without that initial 
absolute fear  it is  only  an empty selfcentred  attitude  for  its 
form  or  negativity  is  not  negativity  per  sc  and  therefore  its 
formative  activity  cannot  give  it  a  consciousness  of itself  as 
essential being  Ifit has not experenced absolute fear but only 
some lesser dread the negative being has remained for it somecid
thing external its substance has not been infected by it through 
and through Since the entire contents of its natural consciouscid
ness have not been jeopardized determinate being still in princid
ciple  attaches to it having a  mipd of ones own  is  selfwin  a 
freedom  which is  still  enmeshed  in  servitude  Just as  little  as 
the  pure form  can  hecome  essential  being for  it just  as  little 
is that form regarded as extended to the particular a  universal 
formative activity an absoluteNotion rather itis a skill which 
is  master over some  things  but not over  the  universal  power

  For  the  independent selfconsciousness  it  is  only  the 
pure abstraction of the  that is its essential nature and when 
it does develop its own differences this differentiation does  not 
become a  nature that is  objective and intrinsic to it  Thus  this 
selfconsciousness does not become an  I that in its simplicity 
is  genuinely  selfdifferentiating  or  that  in  this  absolute  difcid
ferentiation  remains identical with itself  On the  other  hand 
the consciousness  that is  forced  back into itself becomes  in its

formative activity its own object in the form of the thing it has 
fashioned and at the same time sees in the lord a consciousness 
that exists as a beingforself But for the subservient consciouscid
ness  as  such  these  two  momentsitself as  an  independent 
object and  this  object as  a  mode of consciousness  and hence 
its own essential  naturefall apart  Since  however  the form 
and the heingforself are for us  or in  themselves  the same  and 
since  in  the  Notion  of independent  consciousness  the  intrinsic 
being  is  consciousness  the  moment  of  intrinsic  being  or 
thinghood which received its form in being fashioned is no other 
substance  than consciousness  We  are  in  the  presence  of selfcid
consciousness in a new shape a consciousness which as  the incid
finitude of consciousness or as its own pure movement is aware 
of itself as  essential being a  being which thinks  or is  a  free  selfcid
consciousness  For tf  think  does  not mean to  be  an abstract  I 
bu tan I which has at the same time the significance of intrinsic 
being of having itselffor object or of relating itself to objective 
being in such a  way  that its significance is  the  beingforself of 
the consciousness for which it is an object For in thinking  the 
object does not present itsefin picturethoughts but in  Notions 
ie  in  a  distinct  beinginitselfor intrinsic being  consciousness 
being immediately aware that this is not anything distinct from 
itself  What is  pictured or figuratively  conceived  what immecid
diately  is  has  as such  the form of being something other than 
consciousness but a  Notion is  also something that immediately 
is  and this distinction in so far as  it is  present in consciousness 
itself is its determinate content but since this content is  at the 
same time a  content grasped  in  thought  consciousness  remains 
immediately aware of its unity with this determinate and distinct 
being not asin the case of a picturethought where consciouscid
ness  still has specially  to  bear in  mind  that  this  is  its  picturecid
thought on the contrary the Notion is  for  me straightway my 
Notion  In  thinking  I  am free  because  I  am  not  in  an  other 
but remain simply and solely in communion with  myself  and 
the object  which is  for  me  the essential  being  is  in undivided 
unity  my  beingformyself  and  my  activity  in  conceptual 
thinking is  a  movement within myself  It is  essential  however 
in  thus  characterizing this shape  of selfconsciousness  to  bear 
firmly  in  mind  that it is  thinking  consciousness  in  general  that 
its object is an immediate unity of beinginitself and beingfor  itself 

FREEDOM  OF  SELFCONSCOUSNESS 

 

The selfsame consciousness that repels itselffrom itself becomes 
aware  of itself as  the  element  of beinginitselj  but  at  first  it 
knows itself to be this element only as a universal mode of being 
in general not as  it exists  objectively in  the development and 
process  of its  manifold  being 

B  This freedom of self  consciousness when it appeared as 
a conscious manifestation in the history of Spirit has as we know 
been  called  Stoicism  Its  principle  is  that  consciousness  is  a 
being that thinks and that consciousness holds something to be 
essentially important or true and good only in so far as it thinks 
it to  be  such 

Igg  The manifold  selfdifferentiating expanse of life  with 
all its detail and complexity is  the object on which desire and 
work operate This manifold activity has  now contracted into 
the  simple  positing  of differences  in  the  pure  movement  of 
thinking  Essential  importance  no  longer  attaches  to  the  dif 
ference as a specific thing or as consciousness ora specific natural 
existence  as  a  feeJing  or as  desire  and  its  object  whether  this 
is  posited  by  myself or by an alien  consciousness  What alone 
has importance is  the difference  posited  by thought  or the dif 
ference  which from the  very first  is  not  distinct from  myself 
This consciousness accordingly has a negative attitude towards 
the lord and bondsman relationship As  lord it does  not have 
its  tru th in the bondsman nor as  bondsman is its  tru th in the 
lords will and in his  service  on the contrary whether on  the 
throne or in chainsin the utter dependence of its  individual 
existence its aim is  to be free  and to maintain that lifeless incid
difference which steadfastly withdraws from the bustle of existcid
ence alike from being active as passive into the simple essenticid
ality of thought Selfwill is the freedom which entrenches itself 
in some particularity and is  still in bondage  while Stoicism is 
the freedom which always  comes  directly out of bondage and 
returns  into  the  pure  universality  of thought  As  a  universal 
form  of the  WorldSpiritl Stoicism  could  only  appear  on  the 
scene in a  time of universal fear and bondage  but also  a  time 
of universal  culture  which  had  raised  itself  to  the  level  of 
thought 

  Now itistrue that for this selfconsciousness the esSence 
is  neither an other than  itself  nor the pure abstraction of the 
I but an which  has  the  otherness within itself  though in 

 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

the  form  of thought  so  that  in  its  otherness  it  has  directly 
returned into itself  Yet at the same time this its essence is  only 
an  abstract  essence  The  freedom  of selfconsciousness  is  incid
different  to natural existence and has  therefore let  this  equally  go 
free  the reflection  is  a  twofold one  Freedom in  thought has  only 
pure thought as its truth a truth lacking the fullness oflife Hence 
freedom in thought too is only the Notion offreedom not the 
living reality of freedom itself  For the essence of that freedom 
is at first only thinking in general the form as such of thoughtJ  
which  has  turned  away from  the  independence of things  and 
returned into itself But since individuality in its activity should 
show itself to be alive or in its  thinking should grasp the living 
world as  a  system  of thought  there  would  have to  be  present 
in  thought  itself a  content  for  that individuality  in  the  one  case 
a  content of what is  good  and in  the other of what is  true in 
order that what is  an object for  consciousness  should  contain 
no  other ingredient whatever except the  Notion  which  is  the 
essence ButheretheNotion as an abstraction cuts itself off from 
the multiplicity of things  and  thus  has  noconten tin its  own 
selfbutone thatisgiven to it Consciousness does indeed destroy 
the con tent as  an  alien immediaty  Sein  when it thinks  it but 
the Notion is  a determinate  Notion  and this  determinateness  of 
the Notion is the alien elementwhich it has within it Stoicism 
therefore was perplexed when it was asked for what was called 
a  criterion of truth as such Le  strictly speaking  for  a  content 
ofthougbt itself To the question Whatis good and true it again 
gave for answer the contentless though t The True and the Good 
shall consist in reasonableness  But this selfidentity of thought 
is  again  only  the  pure form  in  which  nothing  is  determined 
The True and the Good wisdom and virtue the general terms 
beyond which Stoicism cannot get  are  therefore  in  a  general 
way no doubt uplifting  but since they cannot in fact  produce 
any expansion of the content  they soon  become  tedious 

 I  This thinking consciousness as  determined in  the form 
of abstract  freedom  is  thus  only  the  incomplete  negation  of 
otherness  Withdrawn from existence only into itself  it has not 
there achieved its  consummation  as  absolute  negation of that 
existence  The content  it is  true  only counts as  thought  but 
also  as  thought  that  is  determinate  and  at  the  same  time 
determinateness as  such 

FREEDOM OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS 

 
  Scepticism is the realization of tha tof which Stoicism was 
only the Notion and is  the actual experience of what the free 
dom of thought is  This is in itself the negative and must exhibit 
itself as  such  With the reflection  of selfconsciousness  into the 
simple  thought  of itself  the  independent  existence  or  percid
manent determinateness that stood over against that reflection 
has  as  a  matter  of fact fallen  outside  of  the  infinitude  of 
thought  In Scepticism now  the wholly unessential and noncid
independent character of this  other  becomes explicitJor con 
sciousness the abstract thought becomes the concrete thinking 
which  annihilates  the  being  of the  world  in  all  its  manifold 
determinateness  and  the  negativity  of free  selfconsciousness 
comes  to  know  itself in  the  many  and  varied  forms  of life  as 
a  real  negativity 

It is  dear that just as  Stoicism corresponds  to the  Notion  of 
the  independent  consciousness  which  appeared  as  the  lord  and 
bondsman relationship so Scepticism corresponds to its realizacid
tion as a negative attitude towards otherness to desire and work 
But although desire and work were unable to effect the negation 
for selfconsciousness this polemical bearing towards the manicid
fold independence of things will on the other hand be successcid
ful  because it turns  against  them  as  a  free  selfconsciousness 
that  is  already  complete  in  its  own  self  more  specifically 
because it is  thinking  or is  in  its  own  self infinite  and  in  this 
infinitude the independent things in their differences from one 
another are for it only vanishing magnitudes  The differences 
which in  the  pure  thinking  of selfconsciousness  are  only  the 
abstraction  of differences  here  become  the  entirety  of the  difcid
ferences  and the whole of differentiated  being becomes a  difcid
ference  of selfconsciousness 

  Thus the foregoing has defined the nature of the activity 
of scepticism  as  sllchand  the  way  in  which  it  operates  It 
exhibits the dialectical movement  which Sensecertainty  Percepcid
tion  and  the  Understanding  each  is  as  also  the  unessential 
character of what in  the  relationship of lord and  bondsman 
and for  abstract  thinking itself  is  held  to  be  a  determinate  elecid
ment  That relationship  at  the  same  time  embraces  a  specific 
mode in which ethical laws  too  are present as  sovereigh comcid
mands The determinations in abstract thinking  however are 
scientific  Notions  in  which  formal  con tentless  thinking 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 
spreads itself attaching the Notion in fact in a  merely external 
way to  the  being constituting its  content  and  which  for  it  is 
independent and holding as valid only determinate Notions even 
though  these are only  pure abstractions 

  Dialectic  as  a  negative  movement  just  as  it  immecid
diately is  at first  appears  to consciousness  as something which 
has it at its  mercy  and which does not have its source  in  con  
sciousness  itself  As  Scepticism  on  the  other  hanci  it  is  a 
moment of selfconsciousness  to  which it does  not happen  that 
its truth and reality vanish without its knowing how but which 
in the certainty of its freedom  makes  this  other  which  claims 
to be real vanish What Scepticism causes to vanish is  not only 
objective reality as such but its own relationship to it in which 
the  other is  held  to  be  objective  and  is  established  as  such 
and  hence  too  its perceiving  along with firmly  securing what 
it is  in danger of losing  viz  sophistry  and the truth it has itself 
determined and established  Through this selfconscious negacid
tion  itprocures  for  its  own  self the  certainty  of its  freedom 
generates the experience  of that freedom  and thereby raises 
it to  truth  What vanishes is  the  determinate  element  or  the 
moment of difference which whatevritsmode of being and 
whatever its source sets itselfupas something fixed and immutcid
able It contains no permanenteiement and must vanish before 
thought because  the different is just this not to be in possescid
sion  of itself  but to  have its  essential  being  only  in  an  other 
Thinking  however  is  theinsight in to  this  nature  of the  Idif  
fetent  it is  the negative  essence  as  simple 

  Thesceptical selfconsciousness thus experiences in the 
flux  of all  tha t  would  stand  secure  before  it  its  own  freedom 
as  given  and preserved  by itself  It is  aware  of this  stoical  incid
differenceofa thinking which thinks itself  the unchanging and 
genuine certainty of its elf This sefcertainty does notissue from 
something  alien  whose  complex  development  was  deposited 
within it a  result  which would leave  behind it the  process  of 
its coming to be On the contrary consdousnessitselfis the abso

representations whose differences coincide and whose identity 
is equally again dissolved for it is itselfdeterminateness as  concid

this consciousness instead of being selfidentical is in fact noth

ing but a purely casual confused medley the dizziness ofa percid
petually selfengendered disorder  It is  itself aware  of this  for 
itself maintains and creates this restless confusion Hence it also 
admits to it it owns to being a  wholy  contingent  single  and 
separat  consciousnessa  consciousness  which  is  empirical 
which takes its guidance from what has no reality for it which 
obeys what is for it not an essential being which does those things 
and brings to realization what it knows has no truth for it  But 
equally while it takes itselfin this way to be a single and separcid
ate  contingent and  in  fact  animal  life  and  a  lost  selfconcid
sciousness it also  on the contrary  converts  itself again  into a 
consciousness  that is  universal  and  selfidentical  for  it is  the 
negativity of all  singularity and aU  difference  From  this  selfcid
identity or within its own self it falls back again into the former 
contingency  and  confusion  for  this  same  spontaneous  negacid
tivity  has  to  do  solely  with  what is  single  and  separate  and 
occupies  itself with  what  is  contingent  This  consciousness  is 
therefore  the  unconscious  thoughtless  rambling which  passes 
back and forth from  the one extreme of selfidentical selfconcid
sciousness to the other extreme of the contingent consciousness 
thatis hoth bewildered and bewildering It does not itself bring 
these  two thoughts of itself together At one time it recognizes 
that its freedom lies in rising above all the confusion and contincid
gency  of existence  and  at another  time  equally  admits  to  a 
relapse into occupying itselfwith what is  unessential Itlets the 
unessential content in its  thinking vanish but just in doing so 
it is  the consciousness of something unessentiaL  It pronounces 
an absolute vanishing but the pronouncement is and this concid
sciousness is  the  vanishing  that is  pronounced  It affirms  the 
nullity of seeing  hearing  etc  yet  it  is  itself seeing  hearing 
etc  It affirms  the nullity of ethical principles and lets its  concid
duct  be  governed  by  these  very  principles  Its  deeds  and  its 
words  always  belie  one  another  and  equally it  has  jtself the 
doubly  contradictory  consciousness  of unchangeableness  and 
sameness and of utter contingency and nonidentity with itself 
But it keeps  the  poles  of this  its  self  contradiction  apart  and 
adopts  the same attitude  to it as  it does  in  its  purely negative 
activity in general  Point out likeness  or identity  to  it  and it 
will  point out  unlikeness  or nonidentity  and  when  it is  now 
confronted with  what it  has just asserted  it  turns  round  and 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

points out likeness or identity  Its talk is  in fact  like  the squabcid
bling of selfwilled children  one  of whom says  A  if the  other 
says B and in turn says B if the other says A  and who by concid
tradicting themselves buy for themselves the pleasure of continucid
ally  contradicting one  another 

  In Scepticism consciousness  truly experiences itself as 
internally contradictory  From  this  experience emerges  a  new 
form  of consciousness which brings  together  the  two  thoughts 
which  Scepticism  holds  apart  Scepticisms  lack  of thought 
about itself must vanish  because it is  in fact  one  consciousness 
which  contains within itself these  two  modes  This  new  form 
is  therefore one which knows  that it is  the dual  consciousness 
ofitself as selfliberating unchangeable and self  identical and 
as  sefbewildering and selfperverting and it is  the awareness 
of this  selfcontradictory nature of itself 

In Stoicism self  consciousness is  the simple freedom of itself 
In Scepticism this freedom becomes a reali ty nega tes  the other 
side of determinate existence  but really duplicates  itself  and 
now knows itself to be ad uality Consequently the duplication 
which formerly was divided between two individuals the lord 
and the bondsman  is  noW  lodged in one  The duplication  of 
selfconsciousness withini tself  which is essential in the Notion 
of Spirit is  thus  here  before  llS  but not  yet in  its  unity  the 
Unhappy  Conscousness  is  the  consciousness  of self  as  a  dual  
natured  merely contradictory being 

  This unhappy  inwardly  disrupted  consciousness  since  its 
essentially contradictorynature is for it a  single consciollsness 
must for  ever have  present in  the one  consciousness  the other 
aso and thus it is driven out of each in turn in the verymomen t 
when it imagines it has successfully attained to a peaceful unity 
with  the  other  Its  true return into itself  or its  reconciliation 
with itself will  however  display  the  Notion of Spirit that has 
hecome a  living Spirit  and  has  achieved  an actual existence 
because it already possesses as a single  undivided consciousness 
a dual nature The Unhappy Consciousness itself is  the gazing 
of one selfconsciousness  into  another  and  itself is  both  and 
the unity of both is  also its essential nature But it is  not as  yet 
explicitly aware that this is its essential nature or that it is  the 
unity of both 

  Since it is  to begin with only the immediate  unity  of the

two and so  takes  them to  be  not the same  but opposites  one 
of them viz the simple Unchangeable it takes to be the essential 
Being  but the  other  the  protean  Changeable  it  takes  to  be 
the unessential  The two are for  the Unhappy  Consciousness 
alien to one another and because it is  itself the consciousness 
oftbis contradiction it identifies itself with the changeable concid
sciousness  and  takes  itself to  be  the  unessential  Being  But as 
consciousness of unchangeableness or of simple essential Being 
it must at the same time set about freeing itselffrom the unessen  
tial ie from itself For though it indeed takes itself to be merely 
the Changeable and the Unchangeable is for it an alien Being 
yet it is itself a simple hence  unchangeable consciousness and 
hence  is  aware  that  this  consciousness  is  its  own  essence 
although  in  such  a  way  that  again  it  does  not  itself  take 
the  essence  to  be  its  own  The  attitude  it  assigns  to  both 
cannot therefore  be one  of mutual indifference  ie  it cannot 
itself  be  indifferent  towards  the  Unchangeable  rather  it 
is  itself directly  hoth  of  them  and  the  relation  of the  two 
is  for it a  relation of essential  being to the unessential  so  that 
this  latter  has  tohe  set  aside  but  since  for  it  both  are 
equally essential and  contradictory it is  merely the contradiccid
tory  movement  in  which  one  opposite does  not  come  to  rest 
in  its  opposite  but  in  it  only  produces  itself  afresh  as  an 
opposite 

  Here  then  we  have  a  struggle  against  an enemy  to 
vanquish whom is  really to suffer defeat where victory in one 
consciousness is really lost in its opposite  Consciousness  of life 
of its existence and activity is only an agonizing over this existcid
ence and activity  for  therein it is  conscious  that its  essence  is 
only its opposite is conscious only of its own nothingness  Raiscid
ing itself out  of this  consciousness  it  goes  over  into  the  Uncid
changeable but this elevation is itself this same consciousness 
It is  therefore  directly  consciousness  of the  opposite  viz  of 
itselfas a particular individual The Unchangeable that enters 
into  consciousness  is  through  this  very  fact  at  the  same  time 
affected  by individuality  and  is  only present with  the  latter 
individuality instead ofhaving been  extinguished  in  the  concid
sciousness  of the Unchangeable only continues  to arise therecid
from 

   In this  movement however consciousness experiences 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

just this emergence of individ uali ty in the Unchangeable and 
of the Unchangeable in  individuality  Consciousness  becomes 
aware of individuality in general in the Unchangeable and at 
the same time of its own individuality in the latter For the truth 
of this  movement is just the  oneness  of this  dual  consciousness 
This  unity  however  in  the first  instance  becomes  for  it  one 
in which the difference of both is still the dominant feature Thus 
there exist for  consciousness  three different ways  in which incid
dividuality is  linked  with  the  Unchangeable  Firstly  it  again 
appears to itself as opposed to the Unchangeable and is thrown 
back to  the  beginning of the strugge  which is  throughout  the 
element in which the whole relationshipsubsists Secondly concid
sciousness  learns  that individuality belongs  to  the  Unchangecid
able itself so that it assumes the form ofindividuaIity into which 
the  entire  mode  of existence  passes  Thirdly  it finds  its  own 
self as this particular individual in the Unchangeable The first 
Unchangeable  it knows  ony  as  the  alien  Being  who  passes 
judgement on  the  particular individual  since  secondly  the 
Unchangeable is aCorm ofindivid uality like itself consciousness 
becomes thirdly Spirit and experiences the joy offinding itself 
therein and becomes aware oftherecondliation ofitsincliviclucid
aBty with the universal 

 I  What is set forth here as  the  mode and  relationship of 
the Unchangeable has appeared as the experience through which 
the divided selfconsciousness passes in its wretchedness  Now 
this experience it is  true is not its own onesided movement for 
it  is  itself  the  unchangeable  consciousness  and  this  concid
sequently is at the same time a particular individual consciouscid
ness too and the movement is just as  much a movement of the 
unchangeable  consciousness  which  makes  its  appearance  in 
that movement as  much as  the other  For the  movement runs 
through these moments first  the Unchangeable is  opposed to 
individuality in general  then  being itself an individual it is 
opposed  to  another  individual  and  finally  it is  one  with  it 
But this reflection so far as it is  made by us  is  here premature 
for what has come before for us so far is  only unchangeableness 
as unchangeableness of consciousness which for that reason is not 
genuine unchangeableness but one still burdened with an anticid
thesis not the Unchangeable in and for itself we do not know 
therefore how the latter will behave  Here we  know only that 

FREEDOM  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

fot consciousness which is  our object here  the determinations 
indicated  above  appear in the  Unchangeable 

 I   For this  reason  therefore  the  unchangeable consciouscid
ness also retains in its  very form  the basic character of dividedcid
ness  and beingforself in contrast to  the individual consciouscid
ness  Consequently for  the latter the fact that the Unchangecid
able  receives  the  form  of  individuality  is  only  a  contingent 
happening j us tas it also merely finds itself opposed to it so that 
the relation seems  to result from its own nature  That finally 
it doesfinditselfin the Unchangeable appears to it to be brought 
about partly  no  doubt  by itself  or  to  take  place  because  it 
is  itself an individual but this  unity both as regards its  origin 
and the fact that it is appears partly due to the Unchangeable 
and  the  antithesis  persists  within  this  unity  itself  In  fact 
through  the  Unchangeables assuming  a  definite  form  the 
moment  of the  beyond  not  only  persists  but  really  is  more 
firm I yes tablished  for jf the beyond seems to have been brought 
closer  to  the individual consciousness  through  the form  of an 
actyality thatisindividual it henceforth on the other hand concid
fronts  him  as  an  opaque sensuous  unit  with  aU  the  obstinacy 
ofwhatisactual The hope of becoming one with it must remain 
a hope ie without fulfilment and present fruition for between 
the hope and its fulfihnent there stands  precisely  the  absolute 
contingency  or inflexible  indifference  which  lies  in  the  very 
asumption of definite form which was the ground oEhope  By 
the  nature  of this  immediatelyprBsent  unit  through  the  actual 
existence in which it has clothed itself it necessarilyfollowsthat 
in  the world  of time ithas vanished  and  that in space it had 
a  remote existence and  remains  utterly remote 

   If at firstthe mere Notion of the divided consciousness 

was characterized by the effort to set aside its particular indivicid
duality  and  to  become  the  unchangeable  consciousness  its 
efforts from now on are directed rather to setting aside its relacid
tion with the purearmless Unchangeable and to coming into 
relation  only with  the  Unchangeable  in  its  embodied  or  incid
carnate form  For the oneness of the particular individual with 
the U nchangeahle is  henceforth the essenccand the object for 
this consciousness just as in the mere Notion of it the formless 
abstract Unchangeable was  the essential object and the relacid
tion  of this  absolute  dividedness  of the  Notion is  now  what it 

Igo 

B  SELF CONSCIOUSNESS 

has  to  turn  away  from  The initially  external  relation  to  the 
incarnate  Unchangeable  as  an  alien  reality  has  to  be  transcid
formed into a relation in which it becomes absolutely one with 
it 

  The movement in which the  unessential  consciousness 
strives to attain this oneness is itself threefold in accordance with 
the  threefold  relation  this  consciousness  will  have  with  its  incid
carnate beyond first  as  pure consciousness second as  a  parcid
ticular individual who approaches the actual world in the forms 
of desire  and work  and  third as  consciousness  that is  aware 
of its own  beingfor  self  We have now  to  see  how  these  three 
modes of its  being are present and determined in  that general 
rela tionshi p 

   At first then this conscimisness being taken as pure concid
sciousness  the incarnate Unchangeable when it is  an object for 
pure consciousnesScseems to be present in its own proper nature 
But this its own proper nature has not yet come into existence 
as  we  have already remarked  In order that it should appear 
in consciousness in its own ptopernature this would certainly 
have to corne about from its side rather than from  the side  of 
consciousness Thus its presencehereisatfirst only onesidedly 
due to consciousness andjustfor that reason is not perfect and 
genuine  but remains  burdened with imperfection or an anti
ilies 

 

  But  although  the  Unhappy  Consciousness  does  not 
have  theenjQyment of this  presence it has  at  the  same  time 
advanced beyond pure thinking in so far as  this is  the abstract 
thinking of Stoicism which turns its back on individuality altocid
gether  and  beyond  the  merely  unsettled  thinking  of Scepticid
cismwhich is in fact only individuality in the form of an uncid
conscious  contradiction  and  ceaseless  movement  It  has 
advanced  beyond  both of thes  it  brings  and  holds  together 
pure thinking and particularindividuality but has not yet risen 
to  that thinkingwhere consciousness  as  a  particular individucid
ality is  reconciled with pure  thought itself  It occupies  rather 
this intermediate position where abstract thinking is in contact 
with the individuality of consciousness  qua  individuality  The 
Unhappy Consciousness  is  this contact it is  the  unity of pure 
thinking and individuality alsoitknowsitsefto be this thinking 
individuality or pure thinking  and knows  the  Unchangeable 

FREEDOM  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

itself essentially as an individuality But what it does  not  know 
is that this its object the Unchangeable which it knows essenticid
ally in the form of individuality is its own self is itself the indivl 
duality of consciousness 

   In this  first  mode  therefore  where  we  consider  it  as 
pure consciousness it does not relate itself as a thinking consciouscid
ness to its object but though it is indeed in  itself or implicitly 
a  pure thinking  individuality  and  its  object is just this  pure 
thinking although the relation  oj one  to  the  other  is  not  itself pure 
thinking it is only a movement towards thinking and so is devocid
tion  I ts  thinking as such is  no more  than the chaotic jingling 
of bells or a mist of warm incense a musical thinking that does 
not get as far as the Notion which would be the sole immanent 
objective mode of thought This infinite pureinner feeling does 
indeed come into possession of its object but this does not make 
its appearance in conceptual form  not as something specuJacid
tively  comprehendel  and  appears  therefore  as  something 
alien  What  we  have  here  then  is  the  inward  movement  of 
the pure heart which feels  itself  but itself as  agonizingly  selfcid
divided the movement of an infinite yearning which is  Gertin 
thatits essence is such a pure heart a pure thinking  which thinks 
of itself as aparticular individuality  certain of being known and 
recognized by this object precisely because the latter thinks of 
itself  as  an  individuality  At  the  same  time  however  this 
essence is the unattainable beyond which in being laid holci   
fiees  or rather has already flown  It has  already flown  for  it 
is in part the Unchangeable which thinks ofitself as an individucid
ality  and consciousness therefore directy attains in it its own 
selfits own self but as the antithesis of the Unchangeableincid
stead of laying hold of the essence it only feels it and  has fallen 
back into itself Since in attaining itself consciousness is unable 
to get aWilY from itself as this antithesis to the Unchangeable it 
has instead oflaying hold of the essence only laid hold of what is 
unessential Just as on the one hand when striving to find itself 
in the essence it  takes  hold  only of its own separate existence 
so on the other hand it cannot lay hold of the other as an indivicid
dual or as an actual Being Where that other is sought it cannot 
be found for it is supposed to be just a  beyond  something  that 
can not  be found  When  sought  as  a  particular individual  it 
is  not  a  universal  individuality  in  the form  of thought  not  a 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

Notion  but an individual in the form  of an object  or an actual 
individual an object ofimmediate sensecertainty and for that 
very  reason  only  something  that  has  already  vanished  Con 
sciousness  therefore can only find as a present reality the grave 
of its life  But because this  grave is  itself an  actual  existence  and 
it is  contrary to  the nature of what actually  exists  to  afford  a 
lasting possession the presence of that grave  too is  merely the 
struggle of an enterprise doomed to failure But having learned 
from  experience that the grave  of its actual  unchangeable Being 
has  no  actuality  that  the  vanished  individuality  because  it  has 
vanished is not the true individuality consciousness will abancid
don its  quest for  the  unchangeable  individuality  as  an  actual 
existence  or will stop trying to hold on to  what has vanished 
Only then is  it capable of Hnding individuality in  its genuine 
or universal form 

  But in the first instance the  return  of the feeling  heart into 
itself is  to  be taken  to  mean  that  it has  an  actual  existence  as 
an individual  It is the pure heartwhichjor usorin itselfhas found 
itselfand is inwardly satiated for although for itself in its feeling 
th essential  Being is  separated from  it  yet this  feeling  is  in 
itself  a  feeHngofselj  ithas felt  the  object  of its  pure feeling 
and this object is  itself  Thus it cornes forward hereasselffeelcid
ing oras an actual consciousness existing on its own account 
In this return into self there comes  to  view its second  relation  
ship that of desire and work in which consciousness finds  concid
firmation of that inner certainty of itself which we know it has 
attained by overcoming and enjoying the existence alien  to it 
viz  existence in  the form of independent  things  But  the  Uncid
happy Consciousness  merely finds  itself desiring  and working  it 
is  not aware  that  to find  itself active in  this  way  implies  that 
it is in fact certain of itself and that its feeling of the alien exis tcid
ence is  this  selffeeling  Since it is  not explicitly  aware  of this 
certain ty its iriner life really remains a still incomplete selfcercid
tainty that confirmation which it would receive through work 
and enjoymentis therefore eq ually incomplete in other words 
it must itself set at nought this confirmation so  that it  may incid
deed find in it confirmation  but only confirmation of what it 
is joritself viz  of its  dividedness 

  The world of actuality  to  which  desire  and  work  are 
directed is no longer for this consciousness something intrinsically 

FREEDOM OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 
null something merely to be set aside and consumed but somecid
thing  like  that  consciousness  itself  an  actuality  broken  in  two 
which  is  only  from  one  aspect  intrinsically  null  but  from 
another aspect is  also  a  sanctified  world j  it  is  the  form  of the 
Unchangeable for this has retained individuality and because 
as  the Unchangeable it is  a  Universal its individuality has  in 
general the significance of all  actuality 

  If consciousness  were  aware  of being  an independent 
consciousness and the world of actuality were for it an absolute 
nullity then in work and enjoyment it would attain toa feeling 
of its independence since the world of actuality would be nullicid
fied  by  itself  But  since  this  actuality  is  for  consciousness  the 
form of the Unchangeable it is unable of itself to nullify it  On 
the contrary since  it does succeed in setting it at nought and 
enjoying it this comes about through the Unchangeables itself 
having surrendered its embodied form  and having relinquished it 
for  the enjoyment of consciousness  Consciousness on its  part 
likewise makes its appearance as an actuality but also as divided 
within itselfand in  its  work  and  enjoyment  this  divided ness 
displays itsefasbreaking up into a relaon  to the world of actucid
ality  or a  being which is jor itself  and  into  a  being  that is  in 
itself  That relation  to  actuality is  the changing  of it or working 
on it the beingforself which belongs to the individual consciouscid
ness as such But in this relation it is also in itselfor has intrinsic 
being  this  aspecthelongs  to  the  Unchangeable  beyond  and 
consists  of faculties  and  powers  a  gift from  an  aliensQurce 
which the Unchangeable makes over to consciousness to make 
use  of 

 I  Accordingly consciousness in its activity is  in the first 
instance a relationship of two extremes On one side it stands 
as actively present  whiLe  confronting it is  a  passive actuality 
the two sides  are in relation with one another  but both have 
so withdrawn into the Unchangeable and stand fast in themcid
selvesltis therefore only a superficial element from each side 
thatisinvolved inthe moving interplay of their mutualopposi  
don The passive extreme of actuality is setaside by the active 
extreme  but the  actuality  on  its  side  can  only  be  set  aside 
because its own unchangeable essence sets it aside  repels itself 
from  itself  and  hands  over  what  is  repelled  to  the  active 
extreme The active force appears as  the power in which actu

B  SELFGONSCIOUSNESS 

ality is dissolved for this very reason  however  the consciouscid
ness to which the intrinsic or essential Being is an other regards 
this power which it displays in its activity to  be  the  beyond  of 
itself Instead therefore of returning from its activity back into 
itself  and  having  obtained  confirmation  of its  selfcertainty 
consciousness  really  reflects  this  activity  back  into  the  other 
extreme which is thus exhibited as a pure universal as the absocid
lute power from which the activity started in all directions and 
which is  the essence both of the selfdividing extremes as  they 
at first appeared and of their interchanging relationship itself 
  The fact  that the unchangeable consciousness renounces 
and surrenders its embodied form  while  on the other hand  the 
particular individual consciousness gives thanks for the gift ie 
denies itself the satisfaction of being conscious of its independence 
and  assigns  the  essence  of its  action  not  to  itself but  to  the 
beyond  through  these  two  moments  of reciprocal  selfsurrender 
of both parts consciousness does  of course  gain a  sense of its 
unity with the Unchangeable But this unity is at the same time 
affected with division  is  again broken within itself  and from 
it there emerges once more the antithesis of the universal  and 
the individual For though consciousness renounces the show of 
satisfying its feeling  of self  it obtains the  actual  satisfaction  of 
it for it has heen desire work  and enjoyment as consciousness 
it has willed acted and enjoyed  Similarly even its giving of thanks 
in  which it acknowledges  the  other  extreme  as  the  essential 
Being and counts itself nothing is  its  own  act which  countercid
balances the action of the other  extreme  and  meets  the  self 
sacrificing  beneficence with a like action  If the other extreme 
delivers  oer to consciousness only the surface  of its  being  yet 
consciousness  also  gives  thanks  and  in  surrendering  its  own 
action ie its essential being it really does more than the other 
which only sheds a superficiaLelementofitself Thus the entire 
movement is reflected not only in the actual desiring working 
and  enjoyment  but even in  the  very  giving  of thanks  where 
the reverse seems  to  take  place  in  the  extreme  of individuality 
Consciousness feels  itself therein as  this  particular individual 
and does not letitselfbe deceived by its own seeming renunciacid
tion for the truth of the matter is that it has not renounced itself 
What has been brought about is only the double reflection into 
the two extremes  and the result is  the renewed  division  into 

FREEDOM  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

the  opposed  consciousness  of the  Unchangeable  and  the  concid
sciousness  of  willing  performing  and  enjoying  and  selfcid
renunciation itself which confronts  it in other words  the  concid
sciousness  of independent individuality  in  generaL 

  With this appears the third relationship of the process 

of this consciousness which proceeds from the second as  a concid
sciousness that has truly proved itself to be independent by its 
will  and  its  deed  In  the  first  relationship  it was  merely  the 
notion of an actual consciousness  or the inner feeling or heart 
which  is  not yet actual  in  action  and  enjoyment  the  second 
is  this  actualization  as  an  external  action  and  enjoyment 
Returned  from  this  external  activity  however  consciousness 
has experienced itself as  actual  and  effective  or knows  that it is 
in  truth in and for  itself  But  here  now  is  where  the  enemy 
is  met with in his  most  characteristic form  In the struggle of 
the  heart and emotions  the individual  consciousness is  only a 
musicalahstrayt moment In work and enjoymentwhich make 
this unsubstantial existence a reality it can directly fbrget itselj 
and the consciousness of its own particular role  in this realization 
is  canceUedoutby the act of thankful acknowledgement  But 
this  cancellingout  is  in  truth  a  return  of consciousness  into 
itself and moreover into itself as  the actuality which it knows 
to  be true 

  This third relationship in which  this  true  actuality is 
one oftheterms is the relation of that actuality as a nothingness 
to the universal Being The process of this relation we have yet 
to  consider 

  To beginwithas regards the contradictory relation in 
which  consciousness  takes  its  own  reality  to  be  immediately  a 
nothingness  its actual doing thus  becomes  a  doing  of nothing 
its enjoyment a feeling onts wretchedness Work and enjoyment 
thus lose all universal content and significance for if they had any 
they would have an absolute being of their own Both withdraw 
into  their mere  particularity  which  consciousness is set  upon 
reducing to nothingness  Consciousness is  aware of its elf as this 
actual individual  in the  animal  functions  These  are no longer 
performed  naturally  and  without  embarrassment  as  matters 
trifling in themselves which cannot possess any importance or 
essential significance for Spirit instead since it is in them that 
the enemy reveals himsefin his characteristic shape  they are 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

rather the object of serious  endeavour  and  become  precisely 
matters  of  the  utmost  importance  This  enemy  however 
renews  himself in  his  defeat  and  consciousness  in  fixing  its 
attention on him farfrom freeing itselffrom him really remains 
for  ever in contact with him and for ever sees itself as defiled 
and since at the same time this  object of its  efforts  instead  of 
being something essential is of the meanest character instead 
ofbeing a universal is the merest particular we have here only 
a personality confined to its own self and its own petty actions 
a  personality  brooding  over itself  as  wretched  as  it  is  impo 
verished 

  But to both of these moments the feeling of its  wretch 
edness  and  the  poverty of its  actions  is  linked  the  conscious  
ness  of its  unity  with  the  Unchangeable  For  the  attempted 
direct destruction of what itactualyis is mediated by the thought 
of the Unchangeable and takes place in this relation  to it  The 
mediated relation  constitutes  the essence  of the negative movecid
ment in whichconsdousness turns against its particular indivicid
dUalitybutwhichquarelationis in itseifpositive  and wilLhring 
consciousnesiitself to an  awareness  of its  unity  with  the  Uncid
changeable 

  This mediated relation is  thus a  syllogism in which the 
individuality initially fixed  in  its  antithesis  to  the  initself  is 
unitd with  this  other  extreme  only  thrGugha  third  term 
Throughtbismid dleterm the one extreme the Unchangeable 
is  brought  into  relation  with  the  unessential  consciousness 
which equally is  brought into relation with the Unchangeable 
only through this  middle  term  thus  this  middle  term  is  one 
which presents the two extremes to one another and ministers 
to eachinitsdealings with theother This middle termisitself 
a conscious Being the mediator  foritisan action whichmedicid
ates  consciousness  as  such  the  content  of this  action  is  the 
extinction of its particular individuality which consciousness is 
undertaking 

  In the mediator then this consciousness frees itselffrom 
action and  enjoyment so  far  as  they are  regarded  as  its  own 
Asaseparate independent extreme it rejects the essence of its 
will  and  casts  upon the  mediator or minister  priest  its  own 
freedom ofdedsion and herewith the responsibility for its own 
action This mediator having a direct relationship with the un  

FREEDOM  OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

changeable Being  ministers by giving advice on what is  right 
The action  since it follows  upon the decision  of someone else 
ceases  as  regards  the doing or the willing  of it  to he  its  own 
But there is still left to the unessential consciousness the objective 
aspect  viz  the  fruit  of its  labour  and  its  enjoyment  These 
therefore it rejects as well  and just as  it renounces its  will  so 
it renounces  the  actuality  it  received  in  work and  enjoyment 
It  renounces  them  partly  as  identified  with  the  truth  it  has 
attained  regarding  its  own  seWconscious  independencein 
asmuch as what it does is foreign to it  a  thinking and speaking 
of what is  meaningless  to it  partly as identified  with external 
possessionswhen  it  gives  away  part of what  it  has  acquired 
through  work  and  partiy  also  as  identified  with 
the 
enjoyment it has hadwhen in its fastings and mortifications 
it once more completely denies  itself that enjoyment 

  Through these  moments of surrender  first  of its  right 

to decide for itself then of its property and enjoyment anp fincid
ally through the positive momentofpractisingwhatit does not 
understand it truly and  completely deprives itself of the concid
sciousness of inner and outerfreedom of the actualityin which 
cQllsciousnes existsor itself It bas the certainty of having truly 
divested itself of its  and of having turned its immediate selfcid
consciousness  into  a  Thing  intoan  objective  existence  Only 
through  this  actual  sacrifice  could  it  demonstrate  this  selfcid
renunciation  For only therein does  the deception  vanish  which 
lie in the inner acknowledgement of gratitude througb heart 
sentiment and tongue an acknowledgement which indeed dis 
clms all power pertaining  to its own independent existence 
ascribing it all to a gift fromahove but which in this very discid
claimer holds on  to its own particular existence  does  so  outcid
wardly in the possessions it does not surrender inwardly in the 
consciousness of the decision it has itself made and in the concid
sciousness of its  content  which it  has itself determined  which 
it has notexcbangerl for one coming from  outside  which last 
wQuldfill it up with  what is  meaningless for it 

  But in the sacrifice actually earned out consciousness 
having nullified  the actiQn as its own doing  has also in principlL 
obtained relieffrom its misery That this reliefhas been obained 
in principle is  however  the  action of the other extreme  of the 
syllogism  which is  the  essence  possessed  of intrinsic  being  But 

B  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

Ig 
that sacrifice made by the unessential extreme was at the same 
time  not  a  onesided  action  but  contained  within  itself the 
action of the other For the surrender of ones own will is  only 
from  one  aspect  negative  in  principle  however  or in itself 
it  is  at the same  time positive  viz  the  positing  of will  as  the 
will  of an other  and  specifically of will  not as  a  particular 
but as a universal will This positive meaning of the negatively 
posited particular will is  taken  by  this consciousness  to  be the 
will  of the other extreme  the will  which  precisely because it 
is an other for consciousness becomes actual for it not through 
the  Unhappy Consciousness  itself  but  through  a  Third  the 
mediator as  counsellor  Hence for  consciousness  its  will does 
indeed become universal and  essential will  but consciousness 
itselfdoes not take itself to be this essential will  The surrender 
of its  own  will  as  a particular  will  is  not  taken  by  it  to  be  in 
principle the positive aspect of universal will Similarly its givcid
ing up of possessions and enjoyment has only the same negative 
meaning and the  universal  which  thereby comes  to  be for it 
is  not regarded  as  its  own  doing  This  unity  of objectivity  and 
beingforself  which  lies  in  the  Notion  of action  and  which 
therefore  becomes  for  consciousness  essence  and  ohjectthis 
unity is  not the  principle of its  action and  so  too  it does  not 
become an objectjor consciousness  directly  and  through  itself 
Rather it lets the mediating minister express  this  certainty a 
cCtainty which is itself still incomplete that its  misery is  only 
in principte the reverse ie thatits action brings it only in principle 
selfsatisfaction or  blessed  enjoyment  that its  pitiable  action 
too is only in principle the reverse viz  an absolute action  that 
in  principle action is  only really action  when it is  the  action 
of a particular indi vid ual Butjor itself action and its own actual

overcoming of these in  a  positive sense  remains  a  beyond  Hut 
in this object in which it finds  that its  own action and  being 
as  being  that of this  particular  consciousness  are  beng and

of Reason  of the  certainty that  in its  particular individuality

V THE CERTAINTY AND TR UTH OF REASON 

 I  In grasping the thought that the single idividual concid

in  itself  Absolute  Essence  consciousness  has 
sciousness  is 
returned into itself For the Unhappy Consciousness the initself 
is the beyond ofitself But its movement has resulted in positing 
the completely developed single individual or the single indivicid
dual that is  an actual consciousness  as  the negative of itself  viz 
as  the  objective  extreme  in  other  words  it  has  successfully 
struggled  to  divest itself of its  beingforself and has  turned  it 
into mere  being  In this  movement it has also become aware 
of its unity with this universal  a  unity which for  us  no longer 
falls  outside of it since  the superseded single individual is  tbe 
universal and which since consciousness maintains itselfin this 
its  negativity is present in consciousness as such as its  essence 
Its truth is that which appears in the syllogism whose extremes 
appeared as held absolutely asunder as the middle term which 
proclaims to the unchangeable consciousness that the single incid
dividual has renounced itself  and  to  the individual  that the 
Unchangeable is for it no longer an extreme but is reconciled 
with it  This middle term is  the unity  directly  aware  of both 
and  connecting  them  and is  the  consciousness of their  unity 
which it proclaims  to  consciousness  and  thereby  to  itself  the 
consciousness of the  certainty of being all  truth 

  Now that self  conSciousness is Reilson its hitherto negacid

tive relation  to  otherness turns round into a  positive  relation 
Up till  now it has been concerned  only with its independence 
and freedom  concerned  to  save  and  maintain  itself for  itself 
at the expense of the world or of its own actuality bothofwhich 
appeared  to  it  as  the  negative  of its  essence  But  as  Reason 
assured of itself it is at peace with them and can endure them 
for it is  certain that it is itself reality or that everything actual 
is none other than itself its  thinking is itself directly actuaJity 
and thus its relationship to the latter is that ofidealism Apprecid
hending itself in  this  way  it is  as  if the world  had  for  it only 

c  AA  REASON 

now  come  into  being  previously  it  did  not  understand  the 
world  it desired  it  and  worked  on  it  withdrew  from  it  into 
itself and abolished it as  an existence on its  own  account  and 
its  own  self  qua  consciousnessboth  as  consciousness  of  the 
world as essence and as consciousness of its nothingness In thus 
apprehending itself after losing the grave of its  truth after the 
abolition ofits actuality is itself abolished  and after the singlecid
ness  of consciousness is  for  it in itself Absolute  Essence  it discid
covers the world as its new real world which in its permanence 
holds  an interest for  it which  previously  lay only in  its  transcid
iency j  for  the existence of the world  becomes  for  selfconsciouscid
ness its own truth  and presence  it is  certain of experiencing only 
itself therein 

  Reason  is  the  certainty of consciousness  that  it  is  all 
reality thus does idealism express its Notion Just as consciouscid
ness that comes on the scene as Reason possesses that certainty 
directly  in  itself  so  too  does  idealism  give  direct  expression  to 
that certainty  I  am  r in  the sense  that  the    which  is  an 
object for  me  is  the  sole  object  is  all  reality  and  all  that  is 
present  Here  the  I that is  object for  me  is  not  merely  an 
empty  object in general  as  it is  for  selfconsciousness  as  such 
noris i tas infreeseWcoDsciousness merely an objectthatwith  
drawsitselffrom other objects which retain their worth alongside 
it on the  contrary  it  is  for  selfconsciousness  an object  such 
that any other object whatever is a nonheing  But self  consciouscid
ness  is  all  reality  not  merely for  itself but  also  in  itself  only 
throgh  becoming  this  reality  or  rather  through  demonstrating 
itself to  be such  It demonstrates itself to  be  this along  thl path 
in which first  in the dialectic movement ofcmeaning perceivcid
ing and understanding otherness as  an intrinsic  being  vanishes 
Then in the movement through the independence of consciouscid
ness in lordship and  bondage  through  the conception  of freecid
dom  through the  liberation  that comes  from  Scepticism  and 
the struggle for absolute liberation by the consciousness divided 
againsthself otherness  in  so  far  as  it is  only for  consczousness 
vanishes for consciousness itself There appeared two aspects one 
after the other  one in  which  the  essence or the True had for 
consciousness the determinateness of being  the other in which 
it had  the determinateness  of being  only for  consciousness  But 
the two reduced  themselves to a single truth viz  that what is 

eER TAINTY  AND  TR UTH  OF  REASON 

 

or the initsef only is  in  so  far  as  it is for  consciousness  and 
what is Jor  consciousness  is  also  in  itself or  has  intrinsic  being 
The consciousness  which is  this  truth  has  this  path  behind  it 
and  has  fqrgotten  it  and  comes  on  the  scene  immediately  as 
Reason in other words this Reason which comes immediately 
on  the scene  appears only  as  the  certainty  of that  truth  Thus 
it  merely  asserts  that it is  all  reality  but  does  not  itself comcid
prehend  this  for  it  is  along  that  forgotten  path  that  this 
is  comprehended  And 
immediately  expressed  assertion 
equally anyone who has not trodden this  path finds  this assercid
tion  incomprehensible when  he  hears  it in  this  pure  formcid
although he does  as  a  matter of fact  make  the  assertion  himcid
self in  a  concrete  shape  ie  the  assertion  is  implicit  in  his 
behaviour  

  The idealism that does  not demonstrate that path  but 
starts  off with  this  assertion  is  therefore  too  a  pure  assertion 
which does not comprehend its own self  nor can it make itself 
comprehensible  to  others  It proclaims  an  immediate  certainty 
which  is  confronted  by  other  immediate  certainties  which 
have however been lost on that same path With equal right 
therefore the assertions of these other certainties too take their 
place alongside the assertion of that certainty Reason appeals 
to the selfconsciousness of each and every consciousness  am 
J  my object and my essence is  and no one will deny Reason 
this truth Butin basing itself on this appeal Reason sanctions 
the  truth  of the  other  certainty  viz  that  there  is for  nre  an 
other that an other than is object and essence for me  or 
in that I am object and essence to myself I  am only so bydraw 
ing back from  the other  altogether and  taking  my place  as 
an actuality alongside  it  Not until Reason  comes  on the scene 
as  a  reflection  from  this  opposite  certainty does  its  affirmation 
aboutitselfpresent itself not merely as a certainty and an assercid
tion  but as  truth and  not merely alongside  other truths  but 
as  the sole  truth  Its  immediate  appearance  on  the  scene  is  the 
abstraction  of its actual presence  the essence  and  the  initself of 
which is  the absolute Notion ie  the movement  which  has  brought 
it  into  heing  Consciousness  will  determine  its  relationship  to 
otherness or its object in various ways according to the  precise 
stage it has reached in the development of the WordSpirit into 
selfconsciousness How it immediately finds and determines itself 

c  AA  REASON 

and its object at any time  or the way in which it is for  itself 
depends on  what  it has  already  become  or  what  it  already is 
in  itself 

  Reason is  the certainty of being all reality  This initself 
or this reality is however a universal pure and simple  the pure 
abstraction  of reality  It is  the  first  positivity  in  which  selfconcid
sciousness is in zts  own self explicitly for itself  and P is  therefore 
only the pure essentiality of the existent or is  the simple category 
The category  which formerly  had  the  meaning  of being  the 
essentiality of the existentand it was  undetermined  whether of 
the existent as such or of the existent contrasted with consciouscid
nessis now the essentiality or simple unity of the existent only 
as  a  reality  that  thinks  in  other  words  the  category  means 
this that selfconsciousness and being are the same essence  the 
same  not through comparison  but in and  for  themselves  It 
is only the onesided spurious idealism that lets this unity again 
come on the scene as consciousness on one side  confronted by 
an initself  on the other But now this category or simple  unity 
of selfconsciousness and being possesses difference in  itself  for 
its  essence is just this  to  be immediately one  and  selfsame  in 
otherness  or in absolute difference  The difference  therefore is 
butisperfectly transparent and a difference that isat the same 
time none  It appears as a plurality of categories Since idealism 
proclaims the simple unity of selfcon sci pus ness to be aU reality 
and immediately  maes it the essence witholt  having grasped it 
as  the  absolutely  negative  essenceonly  this  has  negation 
determinateness or difference within itthis second  assertion 
is  even more incomprehensible than  the first  viz  that in  the 
category there are differences  or species  of categories  The assercid
tion  as  such  as  also  the  assertion  as  to  any  specific  number  of 
species  of categories  is  a  new  assertion which  however  itself 
implies that we no longer have to accept it as an assertion  For 
since the difference originates in the pure I in the pure U ndercid
standingitself it is  thereby made  explicit  that  the  immediacy 
the making of assertions and   mere  finding  of differences  is 
here  given  and  we  begin  to  comprehend  But  to  pick  up  the 
plurali ty of ca tegories again in some way or other as a welcome 
find  taking them eg from  the variousjudgements and comcid
placently  accepting  them  so  is  in fact  to  he  regarded  as  an 
outrage on Science  Where else should  the Understanding be 

CER TAINTY  AND  TR UTH  OF  REASON 

 
able to demonstrate  a  necessity  if it is  unable  to  do  so  in  its 
own self  which is  pure necessity 

  Now  because  in  this  way  the  pure  essentiality  of 
things like their difference belongs to Reason we can strictly 
speaking no longer talk of things  at all  ie  of something which 
would be for  consciousness merely the negative of itself  For to 
say  that  the  many  categories  are  species  of the  pure  category 
means  that  this  latter  is  still  their  genus  or  essence  and  is  not 
opposed to them But ambiguity already attaches to them since 
in their plurality  they possess  otherness in contrast  to the pure 
category  In fact  they  contradict the  pure  category  by  such 
plurality  and the  pure unity  must  supersede  them  in  itself 
thereby constituting itselfa negative unity of the differences But 
as  negative unity it excludes from itself both the differences  as 
such  as  well  as  that first  immediate  pure unity as  suc and  is 
a  singular  individual  a  new category which is  consciousness  as 
exclusive ie consciousness for  which there is  an  other  The 
singular individual is  the  transition  of the  category  from  its 
Notion to an external reality the pureschema which is  both concid
sciousness and since it is a singular individual and an exclusive 
unit the pointing to an other But this other of the category is 
merely the other firstmentioned categories viz pure essentiality 
and pure  difference  and in this  category j  ie just in  the positedcid
ness  of the  other  or  in  this  other  itself  consciousness  is 
equally itself  Each of these different moments points or refers 
to another butat the same time they do not attain to otherness 
The pure category points  to  the species  which  pass  over into 
the negative category or singular individual  this  latter  howcid
ever points back to them It is itself pure consciousness  which 
is  aware in each of them of being always  this  clear unity  with 
itself buta unity which equally is referred  to an other which 
in being has vanished and in vanishing also  comes into being 
again 

  Here  we  see  pure  consciousness  posited  in  a  twofold 
manner once as  the restless  movement to and  fro  through  all 
its moments aware in them of an otherness which is superseded 
in the act of grasping it and again  rather as  the  tranquil  unity 
certain of its   own  truth  For this unity that movement is  the 
other  while  for  this  movement  that  tranquil  unity  is  the 
other  and  consciousness  and  object  alternate  within  these 

 

C  AA  REASON 

reciprocal determinations Thus on the one hand consciousness 
finds  itself moving about searching here  and  there  its  object 
being the pure initselfand essence  on the other hand it knows 
itself to be the simple category and the object is  the movement 
of the different  moments  Oonsciousness  however  as  essence 
is this whole process itself of passing out of itself as simple cate  
gory  into a  singular individua  into  the  object  and  of concid
templating  this  process in  the object  nuHifying  the  object  as 
distinct  from it  appropriating  it as  its  own  and  prodaiming 
itself as  this  certainty of being all  reaJity  of being  both  itsef 
and  its  object 

  Its first  declaration is  only this  abstract empty phrase 
that everything is its own  For the certainty of being aU  reality 
is  at first  only  the  pure  category  This  Reason  which  first 
recognizes  itself in  the  object  finds  expression  in  the  empty 
idealism  which  grasps  Reason  only  as  it  first  comes  on  the 
scene and fancies that by pointing out this pure mine of concid
sciousness in all being and by declaring aU  things to be sensa  
dons or ideas  it has demonstrated thisjmine of consciousness 
to be complete reality I tis bound therefore to beat the same 
time  absolute  empiricism  for  in  order  to  give  filling  to the 
empty mine Le  to gethold of difference  with all its developed 
formations its Reason requires an extraneous impulse in which 
first is to befoundthe multiplicity of sensations  and ideas  This 
idealism therefore becomes the same kind of selfcontradictory 
afIlbiguity as Scepticism except that while this expresses itself 
negatively  theformer does  so  positively  but  it fails  equally 
with Scepticism to bring together its contradictory thoughts of 
pure  consciousness  being  all  reality  whie  the  extraneous 
impulse or sensations and ideasare equally reality  Instead  of 
bringing them together  it shifts  from  one to the other and is 
caught  up  in  the  spurious  ie  the  sensuous  infinite  Since 
Reason is all reality in the sense of the abstract mine and the 
other is  for  it something indifferent and  extraneous  what  is 
here  made  explicit is  that  kind  of knowing  of an  other  by 
Rtason which wernet with in the form of meaning perceiv  
ing  and  the  Understanding  which  apprehends  what  is 
meant and what is perceived Such a knowing is at the same 
time pronounced  by the  very  principle of this  idealism  not to 
be  a  true knowing  for  only  in  the  unity  of apperception  lies 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
the truth of knowing The pure Reason of this idealism in order 
to reach this  other  which is  easential  to it  and  thus is  the  incid
itself  but which it does not have within it  is  therefore  thrown 
back by its own self on to  that knowing which is not a  knowing 
of what is true in this way it condemns itself of its own know  
ledge and volition to being an untrue kind of knowing and can g 
not get away from meaning and perceiving which for it have 
no  truth  It is  involved  in  a  direct  contradiction  it  asserts 
essence to be a duality of opposed factors  the unity of apperteption 
and equally a  Thing whether the Thing is called an extraneous 
impulse  or an empirical or sensuous entity  or the  Thingincid
itself  it still  remains in principle the same  ie  extraneous  to 
that unity 

  This idealism is  involved in this contradiction because 
it  asserts  the  abstract  Notion  of Reason  to  be  the  True  con  
sequently reality  directly comes  to  be for  it a  reality that  is 
just as  much not  that of Reason  while Reason is  at the  same 
time supposed to be all reality This Reason remains a  restless 
searching and in its very searching declares that the satisfaction 
of finding  is  a  sheer impossibility  Actual  Reason  however  is 
not so inconsistent as  that on the contrary being at first  only 
the certainty  that it is  all  reality  it is  aware in this  Notion  that 
qua  certainty  qua  t l  it  is  not  yet  in  truth  reality  and  it is 
impelled to raise its certainty to tru th and to give filling  to  the 
empty  mine 

A  OBSERVING  REASON 

  It is  true that we now see this consciousness for which 
Being Sdn  means what is its own Seinen  revert to  the standcid
point of  meaning and  perceiving  but not in  the sense  that 
it is certain of what is merely an other  Previously its percepcid
tion  and experience  of various aspects of the Thing were somecid
thing that only happened  to  consciousness  but here  conscious  
ness makes its own observations and experiments Meaning and 
perceiving which previously were supersededjor us  are now 
superseded by and for consciousness itself  Reason sets to work 
to know  the  truth  to find  in the form of a  Notion that which 
for mcaning and perceiving is a Thing ie it seeks to possess 
in thinghood the consciousness only of itself  Reason now  has 

C  AA  REASON 

therefore  a universal interest in the world  because it is  certain 
of its  presence in  the world  or that the world  present  to  it is 
rational  It seeks  its other  knowing  that  therein  it possesses 
nothing else  but itself  it seeks  only its  own infinitude 

  While at first  it is  only dimly aware of its  presence in 
the  actual  world  or only knows  quite  simply  that  this  world 
is its own it strides forward in this belief to a general appropriacid
tion of its  own  assured  possessions  and  plants  the  symbol  of 
its  sovereignty  on  every  height  and  in  every  depth  But  this 
superficial it is  mine  is  not its  ultimate interest  the joy of 
this general appropriation finqs still in its possessions the alien 
other  which  abstract  Reason  does  not  contain  within  itself 
Reason is  dimly aware  of itself as  a  profounder  essence  than 
the pure   is  and  must demand  that difference  that  being 
in its manifold variety become its very own that it behold itself 
as  the actual  world  and  find  itself present as  an  outer  shape 
and  Thing  But  even if Reason  digs  into  the  very  entrails  of 
things and opens every vein in them so  that it may guh forth 
to meet itself it will not attain this joy it must hve cOfPpleted 
itself inwardly before it can  experience  th consummation  of 
itself 

  Consciousness observes ie Reason wants to find  and to 
have itself as existent object  as  an object that is  actually and 
sensuously present The consciousness that observes in this way 
means and indeed says  that it wants to learn not about itstlf 
but  on  the  contrary  about  the  essence  of things  qua  things 
That this  consciousness  means  and  says  this  is  implied  in the 
fact  that it is  Reason  but Reason  as  such is  not as  yet  object 
for  this  consciousness  If it  knew  that  Reason  is  equally  the 
essence of things and of consciousness itself  and that it is  only 
in consciousness that Reason can be present in its  own proper 
shape it would go down into the depths of its own  being  and 
seek Reason there rather than in things  Ifit did find  it then 
it would  be directed to the actual world outside again in order 
to behold therein Reasons sensuous expression but at the same 
time to  take it essentially as  Notion  Reason  as  it  immediately 
comes  before  us  as  the  certainty of consciousness  that it  is  all 
reality  takes  its  reality in  the  sense  of the  immediacy  qf being 
and similarly  the  unity of the with  this  objective  being in 
the sense of an immediate  unity  in which it has  not yet divided 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
and  reunited  the  moments of being and  the or which  has 
not yet discerned  them Reason  therefore in its observational 
activity approaches things in the belief that it truly apprehends 
them as sensuous things opposite to the but whatit actually 
does contradicts this belief for it apprehends them intellectually 
it transforms their sensuous being into Notions ie into just that 
kind  of being which is  at the same time hence  transforms 
thought  into  the  form  of  being  or  being  into  the  form  of 
thought it maintains  in fact  that  it is  only  as  Notions  that 
things have truth Consciousness in this observational activity 
comes to know what things are but we  come to know what concid
sciousness itselfis The outcome of its movement will be that what 
consciousness is  in  itself will  become explicit for it 

  This action  of Reason in its observational role  we  have 
to consider in the moments of its movement how it looks  upon 
Nature and  Spirit  and  lastly  upon  the  relationship  of both 
in the form ofsenfiuous being and how it seeks itselfas actuality 
in the form  of immediate being 

a  Q hservation  of Nature 

  When the unthinking  consciousness  declares  observacid

tion and experience to be the source of truth what it says may 
well sound as ifonly tasting smelling feeling hearing and seecid
ing were involved It forgets  in the zeal with which it recomcid
mends tasting smelling etc to say that iLhas noless essentially 
determined the object of this sensuous  apprehension  and  this 
determination is at least as valid for the object as is the sensuous 
apprehension It will also readily admit that its concern is  not 
wholly and  solely  with  perception  and  will  not  let  eg  the 
perception that this penknife lies alongside this snuffbox  pass 
for an observation What is perceived should at least have the 
significance of a  universal  not of a  sensuous particular 

  This universal is  thus to begin with only what remains 
identical with itself its movement is only the uniform recurrence 
of the same action  Consciousness  which  thus far finds  in  the 
object only universality or theabstractitismine must take upon 
itself the movement proper to the object and since it is  not yet 
the understanding of the object  must at least  be  the  remem  
brance of it which expresses in a  universal  way what in actucid
aity is  present  only  as  a  single  item  This  superficial  raising 

C  AA  REASON 

out  of singularity  and  the  equally  superficial  form  of unim 
versality  into  which  the  sensuous  object  is  merely  taken  up 
without  becoming  in  its  own self a  universal  this  activity  of 
describing  things is  not as  yet  a  movement in the object itself 
the movement is really only in the describing of the object The 
object  as  described  has  lost  its  interest  when  one  has  been 
described  then  another  must  be  started  on  and  continually 
looked for in order that the activity ofdescribing shall not come 
to an end  Ifit is  no longer easy to  find  new whole  things  then 
we  must go  back  to  those  already  found  divide  and  analyse 
them further  and  bring  to  light fresh  aspects of thinghood in 
them  This  restless  insatiable  instinct  can  never  run  out  of 
material to discover a new genus of major importance or even 
a  new  planet  which  although  an  individual  possesses  the 
nature of a  universal  can  be  the  lot of only a  lucky  few  But 
the line  of demarcation of what is  distinctive  of  say  elephant 
oak gold ofwhatisgenus and what species  passes through many 
stages into the endless particularization of the chaos of animals 
and plants of rocks  or the metals earths etc  that only force 
and skill  can bring to view  In this  realm where the universal 
is  undetermined  where particularization approximates again 
to singleness  and again  here and there  descends to it entirely 
there  is  opened  up  an  inexhaustible  supply  of material  for 
observation and description  But here at the boundarylineaf 
the universal where an immense field is opened P forJhatin 
stinct it can have found  not an immeasurable wealth  hut incid
stead merely the bounds of Nature and  of its own activity  It 
can no longer know whether what appears  to  possess intrinsic 
being is not really something contingent  What bears in itself 
the impress of a confused or immature feeble structure barely 
developing  out  of  rudimentary  indeterminateness  cannot 
claim  even to he described 

  While this  searching and  describing seems  to  be  con 
cernedonlywiththings we see thatin fact it does not run away 
into senseperception On the contrary what enables things to 
be intelligently apprehended is  more important to  it than  the 
rest of the complex of sensuous properties which  of course  the 
thing itself cannot dispense with but which  consciousness  can 
do without Through this distinction into what is  essential and 
what is unessential the Notion rises above the dispersion of the 

OBSER VING  REASON 

 
sensuous  and  cognition  thus  makes  it clear  that  it is  just  as 
essentially  concerned  with  its  own  self as  with  things  This 
duplication of what is  essential  gives  rise  to  hesitation  on  the 
part of cognition as  to whether what is  essential and  necessary 
for  cognition  is  so  also  in  respect of things  On the one hand 
the differentiae  enable  cognition  to  distinguish  one  thing  from 
another but on the other hand it is not the unessential aspect 
of things that has to be known but that characteristic whereby 
the things themselves break loose from  the general continuity of 
being as such separate themselves from others and are explici tly 
for  themselves  Differentiae  are suppostd  not  merely  to  have  an 
essential connection with cognition but also to accord with the 
essential  characteristics of things  and  our  artificial  system  is 
supposed  to  accord  with  Natures own system  and  to  express 
only this  This follows necessarily from  the  Notion of Reason 
and the instinct of Reasonfor in this  observational activity 
Reason  operates  only  instinctivelyhas  also  in  its  systems 
achieved this unity viz its objects are themselves so constituted 
that  they  contain  in themselves  an  essentiality or a  beingorcid
self  and are not merely the  accident of a  particular  moment 
or a particular place The dis tinguishing marks orani mals eg 
are taken from  theircla ws  and  teeth for  inpoint of fact it is 
not only cognition that thereby distinguishes one animal from 
another  but  each  animal  itself  separates  itself  from  others 
thereby  by  means  of these  weapons it maintains itself in  its 
independence and in its detachment from  the generality  The 
planton the other hand does not attain to a  heingorself but 
merely touches the  boundaryline ofindividuality It is  at this 
boundary therefore where there is a show of division into sexes 
that  plants  have  been  studied  and  distinguished  from  one 
another  What however  stands on a  still  lower  level  cannot 
itself any longer distinguish  itself from  another  but  in  being 
contrasted with it gets lost Being thatis at rest and being that 
is  in a  relation  come  into  conflict  with  each  other  a  Thing 
in  the latter case  is  something different from  what it is  in the 
former  state  whereas  the single individual maintains itself in 
its relation to something else  What  however  is  unable  to do 
this and qua chemical object  becomes something else  than it is 
empirically  confuses  cognition and gives  rise to the same  concid
flicting views as  to whether it ought to keep  to  one  side  or  the 

C  AA  REASON 

other since the thing itself does not remain identical with itself 
and in it  the  two  sides  fall  apart 

  In those systems therefore which are characterized  by 
a fixed general selfsameness this means that both the cognitive 
side and the things themselves remain selfsame But this expancid
sion of the selfidentical determinatenesses  each of which de  
scribes the course of its progress unhindered and with scope for 
free play  leads of necessity equally to its  opposite  to  the concid
fusion of these determinatenesses for the differentia  the general 
characteristic is  the unity of opposites of what is  determinate 
and  what is  in itself universal it must therefore  split  up into 
this  antithesis  If  now  on  the  one  side  the  determinateness 
gains  the  ascendancy  over  the  universal  in  which  it  has  its 
essence  on  the other side again  this  universal  equally  maincid
tains its control over that determinateness pushes it to its bouncid
dary  and  there  mixes  up  its  distinctions  and  essentialities 
Observation which kept them properly apart and believed that 
in them it had something firm and settled sees principles over  
lapping  one another  transitions  and  confusions  developing 
what it at first  took to he absolutely separate it sees combined 
with something else and what it reckoned to be in combination 
it sees apart and separate So it is that observation which clings 
to passive unbroken selfsameness of being inevitably sees itself 
tormentedjustin its most generaldeterminationseg ofwhat 
are the differentiae  of an animal or a plantby instances which 
rob it  of every  determination  invalidate  the  universality  to 
which it had risen and reduce it to an observation and descripcid
tion which is  devoid of thought 

  Observation which confines  itself in  this  way  to  what 
is  simple  or restrains  the scattered  sensuous  elements  by  the 
universal  thus finds in its object the confusion of its principle 
because what is determinate must through its own nature lose 
itself in  its  opposite  Reason  must  therefore  move  on  from 
the inert  determinateness  which  had  a  show  of permanence 
to observing it its it isin truth viz  as  relating itself to its OppOI 
site  What are  called  differentiae  are  passive  determina tenesses 
which  when  expressed  and  apprehended  as  simple  do  not 
represent their  nature  which  is  to  be  vanishing  moments  of a 
movement  which  returns  back into itself  Since  Reason  now 
reaches  the stage of looking for  the  determinateness  as  some

OBSERVING  REASON 

thing which essentially is  not  for  itself  but  which passes  over 
into its opposite it seeks for the law and the  Notion  of the deter  
minateness  True  it seeks for  them  equally as  an actuality in 
the form  of immediate  being  but this  will  in fact  vanish for it 
and  the  aspects  of the law  become pure moments  or  abstrac  
tions so that the law comes to light in the nature of the Notion 
which has destroyed within itself the indifferent subsistence of 
sensuous reality 

  To  the  observing  consciolisness  the  truth  of the  law  is 
found in experience  in the same way that sensuous  being is  an 
object  for  consciousness is  not in and for itself  But if the law 
does not have its  truth in  the  Notion  it is  a  contingency  not 
a necessity not in fact  a  law  But the fact that it is  essentially 
in the form  of Notion  not only does not conflict with its being 
accessible  to observation but rather for  that very reason gives 
ita necessary existence  and makes it an object for observation 
The universal in the sense of the universality of Reason is also unicid
versal in the sense  im plied  in the  above  Notion  viz  that it is 
for consciousnessthatit displays itself as something present and 
actual  In other words  the Notion  displays  itself in  the form 
of  thinghood  and  sensuous  being  but  it  does  not  on  that 
accollnt lose its nature nor relapse into an inert subsistence or 
an indifferent succession  What is  universally valid is also unicid
versally effective  what  ought  to  be  in  fact  also  is  and  what 
only  ought  to  he  without  actually  being  has  no  truth  The 
instinct of Reason for its part rightly holds firmly to this standcid
point and refuses to be led astray by figments of thought which 
only  ought  to  be  and  as  oughts  are  credited  with  truth 
although they are nowhere met with in experience orby hypocid
theses as little as by all the other invisible entities of a perennial 
ought For Reason is just this  certainty of possessing reality 
and what is not present for  consciousness as something existing 
in its  own  right Selbstwesen  ie  what does  not appear  is  for 
consciousness  nothing at all 

  That the  truth of a  law is  essentially  reality  no doubt 
again becomes for that consciousness which remains at the level 
of observation  an antithesis  to  the  Notion  and  to  what  is  inD 
trinsically niversal in other words itdoes not regard an object 
such as its law as having the nature of Reason  but fancies  that 
it is something alien But it contradicts its own beliefin the fact 

C  AA  REASON 

that itdoesnot itself take its universality to mean that every single 
sensuous thing must have provided evidence of the law in order 
to enable the truth of the law to be asserted The assertion that 
stones fall when raised above the ground and dropped certainly 
does not require us  to make this experiment with every stone 
it does perhaps mean that the experiment must have been made 
with atleast a great number and from this we can then by analcid
ogy  draw  an inference  about  the  rest  with  the  greatest  probcid
ability or with perfect right But analogy not only does not give 
a  perfect right  but on account of its  nature  contradicts  itself 
so often  that the inference to  be drawn from  analogy  itself is 
rather that analogy does not permit an inference to  be made 
Probability  which is what the result would amount to loses  in 
face of truth  every distinction of lesser and greater probability 
let it be as great asit may it is  nothing as  against truth  But 
the instinct of Reason does in fact take such laws for truthand 
it is  when it does  not discern  necessity  in  them  that it comes 
to make  this distinction  and  reduces  the  truth  of the  matter 
itselfto thelevelofprobabHity in order to indicate theimpercid
fectwayin which truth presents itselftp the consciousness which 
has not yet attained  to insight into the pure Notion for  uni  
versality is present only as a  simple  immediate  universality But 
at the same time  on account of this  universality  the law has 
truth for consciousness That a stone falls is truefor consciouscid
ness  because  in  its  heaviness  the  stone  has  in  and  for  itself 
that  essential  relation  to  the  earth  which  is  expressed  in 
falling  Consciousness  thus  has  in  experience  the  being  of the 
law  but it has  too  the law in the form  of a  Notion   and  it is 
only because of the  two  aspects  together  that  the  law  is  true 
for consciousness  The law is  valid as  a law because it is  manicid
fested in the world of appearance and is  also in its own self a 
Notion 

  BecalJse  the law is  at the same time in  itself a  Notion 
the  instinct  of Reason  in  this  consciousness  proceeds  to  refine 
the law and its moments into a  Notion it does this of necessity 
but without  knowing  that  this  is  what it aims  to  do  It puts 
the law  to  the test of experiment  The law  as  it first  appears 
exhibitsitselfin an impure form  enveloped in single sensuous 
forms  of  being  and  the  Notion  constituting  its  nature  is 
immersed in empirical material In its experiments the instinct 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 

of Reason sets out to find  what happens in such and such  cir 
cumstances The result is  that the law seems only to be all  the 
more immersed in sensuous being The inner significance of this 
investigation is  to find  the pure  conditions  of the  law  and  this 
means  nothing  else  even  if the  consciousness  expressing  its 
meaning in this way were to think it meant something different 
than  to  raise the law ibto the form  of Notion  and  to  free  its 
moments  completely from  being tied  to  a  specific  being  For 
example negative electricity which at first comes to be known 
say  as  resinelectricity  and  positive  electricity  as  glasseleccid
tricity  these  as  a  result  of experiments  lose  altogether such 
a  significance and  become purely positive  and negative  eleccid
tricity neither of which is any longer attached  to a  particular 
kind orthing and we can no longer say that there are bodies 
which are positively electrical and others which are negatively 
electrical In the same way  the relationship of acid  and base 
and their reaction constitute a law in which these opposite sides 
appear as bodies But these separated detached things have no 
actuality the  powerwhich forces  them apart cannot prevent 
them from  at once entering again into a  process  for  they are 
only this relation They cannot like a tooth or a  claw  remain 
apart on their own and as such  be pointed out  This essential 
nature of theirs  to  passover immediately into a  neutral procid
duct makes their being into  a  being which is implicitly supercid
seded or universal  and  acid  and  base  have  truth only as unicid
versals Therefore just as glass and resin canjust as well be posicid
tively as  negatively electrical  in the same way acid  ahd  base 
are not tied  as  properties  to this  or that  actuality  each thing 
is only relatively acid or base what seems to bean absolute base 
or acid gets in  the socalled  synsomaties  the  opposite signifi 
cance in relation to something else The result of the expericid
ments is  in this way to cancel the moments or activated sides 
as properties f specific things and to free  the predicates from 
their subjects  These predicates  are found  only  as  universals 
as  in  truth  they  are  because  of this  seWsubsistence  they  get 
the name of matters which are neither bodies nor properties 

I  A  term coined  by  a  chemist  Wintcrl  at  the  beginning  of the  nineteenth  century 
These syosomatics are combinationsformcddirectly without any intermediary which 
would produce and  itself undergo change  they  are  still  in consequence  not strictly 
chemical processes 

C  AA  REASON 

and certainly no one would call oxygen  positive and negative 
electricity  heat  etc  bodies 

  Matter  on  the contrary  is  not  an existent  thing  but is 
being  in  the  form  of a  universal  or in  the  form  of a  Notion 
Reason which is still instinctive makes this  correct distinction 
without being aware that just by testing the law on all sensuous 
being it gets rid of the merely sensuous  being of the law  and 
when it interprets the moments of the  law  as  matters  their 
essential na ture has become for Reason a universal and as such 
is expressed as a nonsensuous thing of sense as an incorporeal 
and  yet  objective being 

  We  have  now  to  see  what  turn  its  result  takes  for  it 

and what new shape its observational activity assumes in concid
sequence We find as the truth of this experimenting consciouscid
ness pure law  which is freed from sensuous being we  see it as 
a  Notion which while present in sensuous being operates there 
independently and unrestrained and while immersed in it  is 
free of it and a  simple  Notion This which is in truth theresult 
and essence of its activity is now present to this consciousness 
itself  but s an object  furthernpe for  it  the  object is  nota 
result  and  is  not  connected  with  the  preceding  activity  it 
presents itself to consciousness as a particular kind ofobject and 
the relation of consciousness  to  it appears as  another  kind  of 
observation 

  Such  an object in which the  process is  present in  the 
simplicity of the Notion is the organism Itis this absolute fluidity 
in which the determinateness through which it would  be only 
for an  other  is dissolved  The inorganic thing has determinatecid
ness for its essential nature and for that reason constitutes the 
moments of the Notion in their completeness only together with 
another thing and therefore is lost when it enters into the pro 
cess in the organic being on the contrary every determinatecid
ness  through which it is  open to  n other is  controlled  by the 
organic simple unity  None of them shows itself as  essential as 
free to enter intorelation with an other and consequently what 
is  organic maintains itself in its relation 

  The aspects of law which the instinct of Reason here procid

ceeds to observe are as foUowsfrom the above characterization 
in the first instance organic Nature and inorganic Nature in their 
relation  to  one  another  The latter is  for  organic  Nature  no 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
more than the freedoma freedom opposed to the simple Notion 
of organic N atureof the loosely  connected determinatenesses in 
which the individual forms  of Nature are dissolved  and  which 
at the same time  breaking  away  from  their  continuity  exist 
on their own account Air water earth zones and climate are 
universal elements of this sort which constitute the indetermicid
nate simple essence  of natural  individualities  and in which 
these  are at the same  time  reflected  into  themselves  Neither 
the individuality nor the universal element is absolutely in and 
for itself  on the contrary  though  they appear to observation 
as free and independent they behave at the same time as essenti 
ally  connected  but in such a  way  that  their  independence  and 
mutual indifference are the predominant feature  and  only in 
part become abstractions Here  then we  have law as  the concid
nection of a  universal  element with the formative  process of 
the organism which on the one hand has the elementary being 
over  against it  and  on the other hand  exhibits  it  within  its 
organic reflection  But laws of this kind animals  belonging to 
the air have the nature of birds  those belonging to water have 
the  nature  offish  animals  in  northern  latitudes  have  thick 
hairy pelts and so onsuch laws are seen at a glance to display 
a poverty which does not do justice to  the  manifold  variety of 
organic Nature Besides the fact that organic Naturein its free  
domcan divest its forms of these characteristics and of necessi ty 
everywhere  presents  exceptions  to  such  laws  or  rules  as  we 
might call them the characteriationofthe creatures to which 
they do applyissosuperficial that even the necessity of the laws 
cannot be other than superficial and amounts to no more than 
the greatirifluence of environment and this does not tell us what 
does and what does not strictly belong  to  this influence  Such 
relations  of organisms  to  the  elements  they  live  in  cannot 
therefore in fact  be  called  laws  For  firstly  the content  of such 
a relation as we saw does not exhaust the range of the organcid
isms concerned and secondly the sides of the relation itself are 
mutually indifferent  and  express  no  necessity  In  the  Notion 
of acid lies the Notion of base just as the Notion of positive eeccid
tricityimplies that of negative but often as we may find a thick 
hairy pelt associated  with  northern latitudes  or the structure 
of a  fish  associated  with  water  or  that  of birds  with  air  the 
Notion of north does not imply the Notion of a thick hairy pelt 

C  AA  REASON 

the Notion of sea  does  not imply  the  Notion  of the  structure 
offish or the Notion of air that of the structure of birds Because 
of the freedom  of the  two sides  in relation  to  each other  tnere 
are  also  land  animals  which  have  the  essential  characteristics 
of a  bird  of a  fish  and  so  on  The  necessity just because  it 
cannot be grasped as an inner necessity of the creature  ceases 
to  have  a  sensuous  existence  and  can  no  longer  be  observed 
in the world of reality but has withdrawn from it Finding thus 
no place in the actual creature it is what is called a teleological 
relation  a  relation which is  external  to  the  related  terms  and 
therefore really the antithesis of a law  It is  a conception cbmcid
pletely freed  from  the necessi ty  of Nature a conception which 
leaves that necessity behind and operates spontaneously above 
it 

  If the relation referred to above of the organism to the 
natural elements does not express its essence the notionofEnd 
on the other hand does contain it Itis true that forthe Qbservcid
ingconsciousness this Notionis not the organisms ownessenJe 
but something falling outside of it and is  then only the ahovecid
mentionedexternalteleologicalrelatiQn Yet the organism as it 
has been  characterized  above  is  infact  the  real  Epq  itself 
for since itpreservesitself in the relation to another it is just 
thatkind of natural existence in which Nature reflects itselfinto 
the Notion and the two moments of caus and trect of active 
and  passive  moments  which  were  the  result  of a  necessary 
separating  out are brought together into a unity so that here 
something does  not appear merely as a reJult  of necessity  But 
because it has returned into itself the last or the result is just 
as much thefirst which initiated the movement  andis to tself 
the  realized  End  The organism does  not  produce  sOlJlething 
but  only  preserves  itself  or  what  is  produced  is  as  much 
already present as  produced 

  We must examine  more  closely  this  determination  of 
End both as it is in itself and as it is  for  the instinct of Refson 
in order to see  how the latter finds  itself therein  but does  not 
recognize  itself in  what  it  finds  The notion  of End  then  to 
which Reason in its  role of observer rises  is  a  Notion  of which 
it is aware  butlt is also no less present as something actual  and 
is  not an external relation  of the latter  butits essence  This actu  
ality which is itself an End is related purposively to an other 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
which means that its relation is  a  contingent one  with respect 
to what both immediately  are immediately  both  are indepen 
dent and mutually indifferent But the essence of their relation 
is  something different from  what  they  thus  appear  to  be  and 
their action has a different meaning from the one sensempercepcid
tion  at  first  finds  in  it  The  necessity  in  what  takes  place  is 
hidden  and  shows  itself only  in  the  End  but in  such  a  way 
that this very End shows that the necessity has also been there 
from the beginning The End  however  shows  this  priority of 
itself in  the  fact  that  nothing  else  issues  from  the  alteration 
resulting from  the action  than what was  already  there  Or if 
we start from what is first then this in its End or in the outcome 
of its  action  returns only to itself  and  through this  very  fact 
it demonstrates itself to  be something  that has its  own  self for 
its  End  and  thus  as  a prius  has  already returned  to  itself or 
is in andfor itself Therefore what it arrives at through the procid
cess ofits action lsitself and in arriving only at itself it obtains 
its feeling of self W eha vehere it is true the distinction between 
what it is  and  what  it  seeks  but  this  is  merely  the show of a 
distinction  and consequently it is  in its  own self a  Notion 

  But this isjust how selfconsciousness is constituted  it likecid
wise distinguishes itself from  itself without producing any discid
tinction  Hence it finds  in  the observation  of organic  Nature 
nothipg else  than a  being of this kind it finds itself as  a  thing 
as  a  life  but makes  a  distinction  between  what it is  itself and 
what it has found a  distinction  however  which is  none  Just 
as  the  instinct  of the  animal  seeks  and  consumes  food  but 
thereby brings forth nothing other than itself so too the instinct 
of Reason  in  its  quest  finds  only  Reason  itself  The  animal 
finishes  up with  the feeling  of self  The instinct of Reason  on 
the  other  hand  is  at  the  same  time  selfconsciousness  but 
because it is only instinct it is put on one side over against con  
sciollsness in which it has its antithesis Its satisfaction is  therecid
fore  shattered by this antithesis it does indeed find itself  viz 
the End and likewise this End as  a  Thing But firstly  the End 
is  for  that instinct Dutsidi  of the thing presenting itself as  End 
Secondly this End qua End is also ohJective  and therefore does 
not fall within the observing consciousness itself but in another 
intelligence 

  Examined  more closely this determination of End lies 

C  AA  REASON 

just as much in the Notion of the thing that of being in its own 
self an  End  That is  to say  it  preserves  itself  ie  it  is  at  one 
and  the same  time its  nature to conceal the  necessity  and  to 
exhibit it in  the form  of a  contingent  relation  For its  freedom 
or its beingforself is just this  to treat the necessity  of the relacid
tion  as of no importance Thus it presents itself as something 
whose  Notion falls  outside of its  being  Similarly  Reason  has 
of necessity  to  look on its  own Notion  as  falling  outside  of it 
hence as a  Thing as  something towards which it is  indifferent 
and  which is  therefore  reciprocally  indifferent  towards  Reason 
and its  Notion  As  instinct  Reason  also  remains  at  the  level 
of mere  being and a state of indifference and the Thing expresscid
ing the Notion remains for it something other than this Notion 
and  the  Notion other than the Thing  Thus  for  Reason  the 
organic thing is in its  own self an  End  only  in  the  sense  that 
the necessity which presents itself as hidden in the action of the 
thingfor this  behaves  as  an  indifferent  beingforselffalls 
outside of the organism itself  Since however  the organism as 
an  End  in its  own self cannot behave in  any  other way  than 
as an organism the fact that it is an End in itselfisalsomanifest 
and  present  in  sensuous  fashion  and  it is  as  such  that  it  is 
observed The organism shows itself to be a  heing thatpreserves 
itself  that returns and has returned into itself  But this  observing 
consciousness  does  not  recognize in  this  being  the  Notion  of 
End or that the Notion of End exists just here and in the form 
of a  Thing  and  not  elsewhere  in  some  other intelligence  It 
makes a  distinction between the Notion of End and beingforcid
self and self  preservation  a  distinction which is  none  That it 
is in fact no distinction is something of which this consciousness 
is  not  aware  on  the  contrary  the  making  of the  distinction 
appears to it as a contingent act having no essential connection 
with what is  brought about by  that act  and  the unity which 
links  the  two  together  viz  the  said  act  and  the  End  falls 
asunder for  this  consciousness 

  On this view what belongs to the organism itself is  the 
action lying in  the nliddle between  its  first  and  last  stage  so 
far as this action bears within it the character of singleness  So 
far however as the action has the character of universality and 
the  agent  of the  action  is  equated  with  the  outcome  of that 
action purposive action as such would not belong to the organ

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
ism That single  action  which is  only a  means  comes  through 
its singleness under the category of an altogether single or concid
tingent necessity  What an organism  does  to  preserve itself as 
an individual or as a genus is  therefore  as regards this immecid
diate content quite uncontrolled  by any law for  the universal 
and the Notion fall outside of it Accordingly its activity would 
be an empty activity devoid of any content of its own it would 
not  be  even  the  activity of a  machine  for  this  has  a  purpose 
and its activity therefore a specific content Deserted in this way 
by the universal it would be the activity merely of something 
immediate qua  immediate  ie  an activity like  that of an acid  or 
base  which  is  not  at  the  same  time  reflected  into  itself  an 
activity which could not separateitselffrom its immediate existcid
ence nor give up this existence  which gets lost in the relation 
to its  opposite  and  still  preserve  itself  But  the  thing  whose 
activity is  under consideration here is  posited  as  a  thing  that 
preserves itselfin its relation to  its  opposite  The activity  as  such 
is nothing but the pure essenceless form onts beingfarself and 
its substance which is  not merely a determinate being but the 
universal or its End  does not fall outside of it It is  an activity 
which spontaneously returns into itself  and is  not turned back 
into itself by anything alien  to  it 

 I  However this unity of universality and the activity does 
not exist for  this  observing  consciousness  because  that  unity is 
essentially the inner movement of the  organism and can only 
be grasped  as  Notion  but observation  seeks  the  moments  in 
the form  of bring of enduring  being  and  because  the  nature 
of what  is  organically  a  whole  is  such  that  the  moments are 
not contained in it nor can beJound in itin that form  consciouscid
ness  converts the antithesis into one  that  conforms  to its  point 
of view 

  In this way the organism appears to the observing concid
sciousness as a relation oftwojixed moments in the form ofimmecid
diate beingof an antithesis whose two sides  on the one hand 
appear to be given to it in observation and on the other hand 
as  regards their content  express  the  antithesis  of the  organic 
Notion  of End  and  actuality  but  because  the  Notion  as  such 
is effaced therein the antithesis is  expressed in an obscure and 
superficial  way  in  which  thought  has  sunk  to  the  level  of 
picturethinking  Thus  we  see  the  Notion  taken  to  mean 

 

C  AA  REASON 

roughly the inner and actuality the outer and their relation procid
duces  the law  that the  outer  is  the  expression  of the  inner 

  When we consider more closely this inner with its oppocid

site and their relation we find  that in the first place the sides 
of the  law  no  longer  have  the  same import as  in  the  case  of 
previous laws in which they appeared as selfsubsistent things 
each as a particular body nor in the second place do we find 
that the universal is  supposed  to  have its  existehce elsewhere 
outside ojthe two  sides  On the contrary  the organic being in its 
absolute undividedness is  made the foundation as the content 
of inner and outer and is the same for both Consequently the 
antithesis is still only a purely formal one whose real sides have 
the same initself for their essence but at the same time since 
inner  and  outer  are  opposite  realities  and  each  is  a  distinct 
being for observation  they each seem to  observation  to  have 
a peculiar content of their own However this peculiar content 
since it is the same substance or organic unity can in fact ony 
bea different form of that  substance  of that unityand  this 
is  implied  by  the  observing  consciousness  when  i tsays  that 
the outer is merely the expression  of the inner We have seen in 
the Notion of End the same determinations of the relation viz 
the indifferent  independence  of the  different  sides  and  their 
unity in that independence a  unity in which they vanish 

  We have now to see what shape the being ofiuner tud 
outer each has  The inner as  such  must nave  an  outer  being 
and a shapejust as much as the outer as such for it is an object 
or is  itself posited  in  the  form  of being  and  as  present  for 
observation 

  The organic substance as inner is the simple  unitary soul 
the pure  Notion  of End or the universal  which in its  partition 
equally remains a  universal fluidity  and  therefore  appears in 
its  being  as  the  action  or  movement  of the  vanishing  actuality 
whereas the outer  opposed to that existent inner subsists in the 
quiescent being oftheorganism The law as the relation of that 
inner to  this  outer  thus expresses its  content once  by  setting 
forth universal moments or simple essentialities  and again  by setcid
tingforth the actualized essentiality or shape  Those first simple 
organic properties  to call them such are Sensibility Irritability 
and Reproduction These properties at least the first two seem 
indeed to refer not to  the organism in general but only  to  the 

OBSERVING  REASON 

animai organism  As  a  matter of fact  the  vegetable  organism 
expresses only the simple  Notion of the organism  which does 
not  develop  its  moments  Consequently  in  regard  to  those 
moments  so  far  as  observation  has  to  take  account of them 
we must confine ourselves to the organism which exhibits them 
in  their dveloped existence 

  Now  as  regards  these  moments  themselves  they  are 
directly derived  from  the  notion  of endinitselC  of a  being 
whose  end is  its  own self  For Sensibility  expresses  in  general 
the  simple  Notion  of organic  reflectionintoself  or  the  unicid
versal  fluidity  of this  Notion  Irritability  though  expresses 
organic elasticity  the capacity of the organism to  react at the 
same time that it is reflected into itself the actualization which 
is opposed to the initial quiescent beingwith inself an actualizacid
tion in which that abstract beingforself is  a  beingJoranother 
Reproduction however is the action of this whole introreflected 
organism its activity as  in itself an End  or as genus  in which 
the individual repels  itself from  itself  and  in  the  procreative 
act reproduces either its organic members or the whole indivicid
dual  Reproduction  taken  in  the  sense  of selfopreservation  in 
general  expresses  the formal Notion of the organism  or Sensicid
bility  but  it is  strictly  speaking  the  real  organic  Notion  or 
the whole which returns into itself either qua individual by procid
clueing single parts of its elf or qua genus by bringing forth incid
dividuals 

  The other significanc of these  organic  elements  viz 
as  outer  is  their particular shape  according to  which  they  are 
present  as   outwardly  actual  but  at  the  same  time  universal 
parts  or organic  systems  Sensibility  let  us  say  as  a  nervous 
system  Irritability  as  a  muscular  system  Reproduction  as  a 
visceral system for the preservation of the individual and  the 
species 

  The laws peculiar to organisms accordingly concern a 

relationship  of the  organic  moments  in  their  twofold  significid
cance once as  being a part of the organic structure and  again 
as  being  a  universal fluid  determinateness  which  pervades  all 
those systems Thus in formulating such a law a  specific sensicid
bility eg  would find  its expression  qua  moment of the whole 
organism in a specifically formed nervous system or it would 
also be linked up with a specific reproduction of the organic parts 

c  AA  REASON 

of the individual or with  the propagation of the whole  and  so 
on Both aspects of such a  law can he observed  The outer  in ac 
cordance with its Notion is beingforanother sensibility eg has 
its immediately actualized mode in the system of sensibility  and 
as a  universal property  it is  in its  outer expressions an objective 
existence as  well  The aspect  which  is  called  the  inner  has  its 
own outer aspect which is distinct from what in general is  called 
the outer 

  Both aspects of an organic law would thus no doubt be 
observable but not the law connecting them and observation 
is  unable to perceive these laws not because  qua  observation  it 
is  too  shortsighted  and  ought not to  proceed  empirically  but 
ought to start from the Ideafor such laws if they were somecid
thing real must in fact actually exist and therefore be observcid
able  but rather  because  the  conception  of laws  of this  kind 
proves  to  have no  truth 

  We found that a law existed when the relation was such 
that the universal organic property in an organic system had made 
itself into a  Thing  and  in  this  Thing  had  a  structurtid  copy 
ofitsdf so  that both were  the same being  presnt in  the one 
case as a universal moment and in the other as a Thing But 
in addition the aspect of the inner is  on i tsowri account also 
a  relationship  of several  aspects  and  we  are  therefore  precid
sented tc  begin with with the conception ofa law as  an inter 
relationship  of the  universal  organic  activities  or  properties 
Whether such a law is possible must be decided from the nature 
of such  a  property  This  however  as  a  universal fluid  is  on 
the one  hand  not something restricted  like a  Thihg  keeping 
itself to the restricted form  which is  supposed  to  constitute its 
shape sensibility extends beyond the nervous system and percid
meates all the other systems of the organism On the other hand 
such a  property is  a  universal  moment  which is  essentially not 
divorced or separated from reaction or irritability  and  repFo 
duction For as  reflectionintoself it eo  ipso  contains reaction 
Merereflectednessintoselfis passivity or a dead being not sencid
sibility just as  actionwhich is  the  same  as  reactionwhen 
not reflected into itself is not irrtability It is precisely the unity 
of reflection in action or reaction and action or reaction in recid
flection that constitutes the organism a unity which is synonycid
mous  with  organic reproduction  It follows  from  this  that  ill 

OBSERVING  REASON 

every mode of the organisms actuality  there must be present 
the same quantity of sensibilitysince to begin with we are COllcid
sidering  the  relation  of  sensibility  and  irritability  to  one 
anotheras of irritability  and  that  an  organic phenomenon 
can be apprehended and determined or if you like  explained 
just as much in terms of the one as of the other What one person 
takes say  for  high sensibility  another may equally well  take 
for  high irritability  and irritability of the same  degree  If they 
are calledfactors  and this word is  not to  be meaningless  they 
are thereby declared to  be moments of the Notion thus the real 
object  whose  essence  is  constituted  by  this  Notion  contains 
them  both  equally  within  it  and  if the  object  is  charactercid
ized  according  to  the  one  moment  as  very  sensitive  it  must 
also  be  stated  according  to  the  other  moment  to  be just  as 
irritable 

 I  If they  are distinguished  as  they  necessarily  are  this 
is in accordance with the Notion and their opposition is  qualitacid
tive  But  when  apart from  this  true  difference  they  are  also 
posited as  they immediately are and for  ordinary thought  as 
they might be as aspects of the law then they appear as quantitacid
tively  distinct  Their  peculiar  qualitative  antithesis 
thus 
becomes one of magnitude  and there arise laws of this kind for 
example  that  sensibility  and  irritability  stand  in  an  inverse 
ratio of their magnitude so  that as  the one increases the other 
decreases or better taking directly the magnitude itself as  the 
content  as  its smallness decreases  Should however a  specific 
content be given to this law say that the size of a hole increases 
the more whatit is filled  with decreases  then thisinverserelation 
can equally be changed into a direct relation and expressed in 
this way  that the size of the hole increases in direct ratio to the 
amount  taken  awaya  tautological  proposition  whether 
expressed  as  a  direct Or  an inverse  ratio  As  so  expressed  the 
proposition means simply this  that a quantity increases as  this 
quantity increases Just as the hole and what fills it and is taken 
away are qualitatively opposed  but what is  real in them  and 
its specific quantity is one and the same in both and similarly 
increase of magnitude and decrease of smallness are the same 
and their meaningless antithesis amounts to a  tautology so  are 
the organic moments alike indivisible in their real content and 
in their magnitude  which is  the magnitude of that being  the 

C  AA  REASON 

one decreases only  with the  other and increases only  with  it 
or  rather  it  is  a  matter  of indifference  whether  an  organic 
phenomenon is  considered  as  irritability or as  sensibility  this 
is so in general and equally when its magnitude is under discuscid
sion  Similarly it is  a  matter of indifference whether we speak 
of the increase ofa hole as an increase of the hole qua emptiness 
or as  an  increase  of the  filling  removed  from  it  Or again  a 
number eg three remains the same quantity whetheritis taken 
positively or negatively and if I increase the three to four  then 
both  the  positive and  the  negative have  become  four  just  as 
the south pole ofa magnet is exactly as strong as its  north pole 
or a  positive  electricity  or an acid  is  exactly  as  strong  as  its 
negative  or the  base on  which  it acts  An  organic  existence  is 
just such a  magnitude as  the  said  three  or a  magnet  etc  It 
is that which is increased or diminished and when it is increased 
both orits factors are increased just as both poles of the magnet 
or both kinds of electricity increase if the potential ofa magnet 
or of onc ofthc electric currents is  raised  That both can vary 
just as little in intension and extension that the one cannot decid
creasclnextenslon but increase in intension  while the other 
conversely  is  supposed  to decrease  its  intension  but increase 
i ts extensionhis stems from the same nbtionofanemptyanticid
thesis the realirttension is absolutely as great as the extension 
and vice  versa 

  It is  evident that what really happens  in formulating 
this kind oflaw is  that at the outset irritability and sensibility 
constitute the organic antithesis but this content gets lost sight 
of and the antitheSis deteriorates into a formal one of quantitacid
tive increase and decrease  or of varying intension  and  extencid
sionan antithesis  which  no  longer  has  anything  to do  with 
the nature of sensibility and irritability and no longer expresses 
it  Hence this  empty play of formulating  laws is  not  confined 
to organic moments but can be practised everywhere and with 
everything and rests in general on a lack of acquaintance with 
the  logical  nature of these  antitheses 

  Lastly  if instead  of sensibility  and  irritability  reprocid

duction is  brought into relation with one or the other of them 
there is no longer evcn the occasion for making laws of this kind 
for  reproduction does  not stand in an antithetical  relation  to 
those moments as  they do to one another  and  since  this  law

OBSERVING  REASON 

making is  based  on such  an antithesis  here even  the  show  of 
its  being practised is  absent 

  The  lawmaking  just  considered  contains  the  difcid

ferences of the organism in their significance as moments of its 
Notion  and strictly speaking should  be  an a priori formulation 
of the  law  But it essentially involves  this  thought  that  those 
differences have the significance of being already given  and the 
consciousness that merely  observes  has  moreover  to  confine 
itself only to  their outer existence The actual organism necescid
sarily contains such an antithesis as is  expressed  by its  Notion 
and such  as  can  be  determined  as  irritability  and  sensibility 
as  these in turn appear distinct from  reproduction  The extercid
nality in which the moments of the Notion of organism are here 
considered is the inners own immediate externality not the outer 
which is the outer of the whole organism and its shape the inner 
in its  relation to  this is  to  be  considered  later on 

  If however the antithesis of the moments is understood 

in the way it is present in outer existence then sensibility irdtcid
ability  reproduction  sink to the level of corpmOn  properties 
which  are  universalities  eqully  indiffernt  towards  one 
another  as  are  specific gravity  colour  hardness  etc  In  this 
sense it may well be observed that the organismismoresenitive 
or more irritable or has a greater reproductive capacity than 
another just as  werpay observe  that  the  sensibility  of one is 
different in kind from that of another that one reacts differently 
to a given stimulus than another eg a horse reacts differently 
to  oats  than  to hay  and a  dog againdifEerently  to  both  difcid
ferences  as  readily observable as that one  body is  harder than 
another  and so  on  But  these  sensuous  properties  hardness 
colour   etc as also the phenomena of response to the stimulus 
of oats ofini table response to loads or Qf the number and kind 
of young produced when they are related  to one another and 
compared among themselves essentially conflict with any concid
formity to a  law  For what characterizes their SltlUOUS  being is 
just this  that they exist in complete mutua indifference  and 
manifest the freedom of Nature released from the control of the 
Notion rather than the unity of a relation irrationally playing 
up and down  on  the scale  of contingent  magnitude  between 
the  moments  of  the  Notion  rather  than  exhibiting  these 
moments  themselves 

 

C  AA  REASON 

  It is the other aspect where the simple moments of the 
Notion of organism are compared with the moments of the outer 
structure  that would first furnish the genuine law expressing the 
true  outer  as  a  copy  of the  inner  Now  because  those  simple 
moments are pervasive fluid properties they do not have in the 
organic thing such a separate real expression as what is called 
an individual  system  of the shape  Or  again  if the  abstract 
Idea of the organism is  truly expressed in those three moments 
merely  because  they  are  not  static  and  are  only  moments  of 
the Notion and of movement the organism on the other hand 
as a structured shape is not exhaustively dealt with in the three 
specific systems into which it is analysed  by anatomy In so far 
as such systems are supposed to be found actually existing  and 
to  be authenticated  by being so found  it must  also  be  borne 
in mind that anatomy presents us not only with three such syscid
tems but with a good many more Furthermore apart from this 
the system of sensibilityas a whole must mean something quite 
different from  what is  called  the nervous system  the irritable 
system something different from  the  muscular system  the recid
productive  system  something  different  from  the  intestinal 
mechanism of reproduction In the systems of shape as such  the 
organism is  apprehended  from  the  abstract  aspect  of a  dead 
existence  its  moments  so  taken pertain  to  anatomy  and  the 
corpse not to cognition and the living organism In such parts 
the moments have really ceased to  be  for they cease to be procid
cesses Since the being of the organism is essentially a universality 
or a reflectionintosel theheingofits totality like its moments 
cannot consist in an anatomical system  on  the  contrary  the 
actual  expression  of the  whole  and  the externalization of its 
moments are really found only as a movement which runs its 
course through the various parts of the structure a  movement 
in which what is forcibly detached and  fixed  as an individual 
system  essentially  displays  itself  as  a  fluid  moment  Concid
sequently that actual existence as it is found  by anatomy must 
not be reckoned as its real being but only that existence taken 
as  a  process  in  which  alone  even  the  anatomical parts have 
a  meamng 

  We see  then  that  the  moments  of the  organic  inner 
taken by themselves are incapable of furnishing the aspects of 
a law of being since in such a law they are asserted of an outer 

OBSERVING  REASON 

existence  are  distinguished  from  one  another  and  neither 
aspect could  be equally named in place of the other further 
that placed on one side they do not find in the other side their 
realization in a fixed system for this latter would as little possess 
any organic truth ie  the  truth of organic  being  as  it would 
be the expression of those moments of the  organic inner The 
essential nature of organic being since it is in itself the universal 
rather consists in general in its moments being equally universal 
in actual existence ie in  their being pervasive processes  but 
not in  giving  an image  of the  universal in an  isolated  thing 
  In this way the idea of a law in the case of organic being 

is altogether lost The law wants to grasp and express the anticid
thesis  as  inert aspects  anp in them the determinateness which 
is  their relation to  one another  The inner  to  which  the manicid
fested  universality belongs and  the  outer  to  which  belong the 
parts of the inert shape were supposed to constitute the correcid
sponding aspects of the law  butas thus held  apartthey lose 
their organic significance and what lies at the base of the idea 
of law is precisely this  that eacq orits two aspects should have 
an independent indifferent su bsistence orits own the relation 
of the aspects  being shared  betweenthem as  a  twofold  detercid
minateness corresponding to thatrelation TheJactisthat each 
aspect of the organism is in its own self just this to bea simple 
universality in which aU determinations are dissolved  and  to 
be  the movement of this  process 

  An  insight  into  the  difference  between  this  way  of 

formulating a law and previous orms wiUmake its nature percid
fectly  clear  If namely we look back to the movement of percid
ceiving and to  that of the Understanding  in which the latter 
reflects itself into itself  and  thereby determines its  object we 
see that the Understanding does not in that movement  have 
before itselfin its object therelqtion of these abstractdetermina  
rions  of universal  and individual  essential and  external  it is 
itself the transition which does not become objective toit Here 
on the  contrary  the organic unity  which  is just the  relation 
of those opposites  this relation being a pure transition is itself 
the ohject  This transition in its  simplicity is  immediately  unicid
versality  and  since  this  universality  explicates  the  different 
moments whose relation is toexpress the law its moments are 
universal  objects  of this  consciousness  and  the  w  runs  the 

 

C  AA  REASON 

outer is  the expression of the inner  Here  the  Understanding 
has grasped  the thought  of the law itself  whereas  previously it 
only looked  for laws generally  and  their moments  were  only 
vaguely  present  to  it  as  a  specific  content  but  not  as  the 
thoughts of the laws As regards content the laws obtained here 
ought not to be such as are merely a passive takingup into the 
form of universality of simply inert differences  but laws  which 
directly possess  in  these  differences  the unrest  of the  Notion 
and consequently at the same time possess  the necessity of the 
relation  between  the aspects  But just because  the  object  the 
organic unity directly unites the infinite supersession or absocid
lute  negation  of being  with  inert  being  and  because  the 
moments are essentially a pure transition  there are no such inert 
aspects as  are required for  the law 

  In  order  to  obtain  such  aspects  the  Understanding 
must keep to the other moment of the organic relationship viz 
to thcrjlectednessof organic existence into itself  But this being 
is so completely refl ected into itself that there is no determinatecid
ness related to something else leftoverfor it Immediate sensuous 
being is immediatelyonewiththedeterminateness as such and 
therefore expresses  a  qualitative difference in that being  eg 
blue asagainstredacidasagainst alkaiand soon But organic 
being that has returned into itselfis completely indifferent tocid
wards  an  other  its  existence is  a  simple  universality  and  it 
denies to observation any lasting sensuous differencE or what 
is the same thing displays its essential determinateness only as 
thejlux  of inert  determinatenesses  Consequently  the  way  in 
which difference  qua  inertexpresses itself is just this  that it 
is  an  indifftrent difference  Le  difference  as  magnitude  In this 
however the Notion is extinguished and necessity has vanished 
But then  the  content and  filling  of this  indifferent  being  the 
fluKcf sensuous determinations gathered up into an organic d ecid
termination expresses also this that the content really does not 
have that determinateness viz that of the immediate property 
and  the  qualitative  element falls  solely in the determination 
of  magnitude  as  we saw above 

  Although  then  the  objective  aspect  which  is  apprecid

hended as an organic determinateness itself contains the Notion 
and is thereby distinguished from the object as it presents itself 
to  the  Understanding which  in  apprehending  the  content  of 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
its laws behaves purely as  perception yet apprehension in the 
first case relapses completely into the principle and the manner 
of the Understanding that merely perceives  For by so  doing 
what is  apprehended  receives  the  character of a  fixed  detercid
minateness  the form  of an immediate property or of an inert 
phenomenon furthermore  it is  subsumed under the category 
of quantity  and  the  nature  of the  Notion  is  suppressed  The 
exchange of an object that is merely perceived for one reflected 
into itself of a merely sensuous determinateness for an organic 
one thus loses once more its value and does so  by the fact that 
the Understanding has  not  yet put behind it  the formulating 
of laws 

  To illustrate this exchange by some examples we may 
find  perhaps that something which perception takes  to  be  an 
animal with strong muscles is defined as  an animal organism 
of high irritability or what perception takes to be a  condition 
of great wekness is defined as a condition of high sensibility 
or  if we  prefer it  as  an  abnormal affection  and  moreover 
a raising of it to a higher potency expressions which translate 
sensuous  facts  into Latin  and  a  bad  Latin at that  instead  of 
into the Notion That an animal has  strong muscles  may also 
be expressed by the Understanding by saying  that the animal 
possessesagreat muscularforce grea t weaknessmeaningsimicid
larIy a  slight force  Determination in terms of irritabiHty has 
this  advantage over determination in terms  of force  that  the 
latter expresses indeterminate but the former determinate recid
flectionintoself  for  the force  peculiar  to  musce  is  precisely 
irritability  and  irritability  is  a  preferable  determination  to 
strong  muscles  since  as  in  force  reflectioninto  sef  is 
already  directly  implied  in  it  Similarly  weakness  or  sHght 
force organic passivity  is  given determinate expression in terms 
of sensibility  But when this sensibility is  so  taken by itself and 
fixed and in addition is  bound up with quantitative determina 
tions and qua greater or less  sensibility is  opposed to a greater 
or less  irritability  each is  wholly in the  element of sense  and 
is  reduced  to  the  ordinary form  of a  property  what connects 
them is not the Notion but on the contrary a quantitative anticid
thesis  which  becomes  a  difference  lacking  any  thoughtcon  
tent  Though  the  indefiniteness  of  the  expressions  force 
strength  and  weakness  was  thereby eliminated  there  now 

C  AA  REASON 

  
arises  the equally futile  vague flounderingabout  between  the 
antitheses ofhigher and lower sensibility and irritability as they 
increase and decrease relatively to one another The determinacid
tions of greater or lesser sensibility or irritability are no less the 
unthinking appffhension and expression of a  sensuous  phenocid
menon than are the wholly sensuous determinations of strength 
and weakness which are devoid of any thoughtcontent Those 
thoughtless expressions have not been replaced  by the Notion  
instead strength and weakness have been gven a determinacid
tion which taken solely by itself is  based on the Notion which 
it has for its content but loses completely this origin and characcid
ter  On  account  of the  form  of simplicity and  immediacy  in 
which this contentis made into the aspect ofa law and because 
quantity constitutes the element of difference in such determicid
nations  the  essence  of the  content  which  originally  is  the 
Notion and is posited as such retains the mode ofsensepercepcid
don and remains as far removed from  being cognized as when 
determined in terms of strength and weakness or by immediate 
senseproperties 

  Now  there still  remains  to  be  considered  solely  on  its 
own  account  what the outer aspect of organic  being is  and how 
in it the antithesis of its inner and outer is  determined Just  as 
at first  the  inner  of the  whole  in  relation  to  its  own  outer was 
considered 

  The outer  considered  by itself  is  the  structured shape  in 
general  the system  of life  articulating  itself in  the  element  of 
being and  at the  same  time  essentially  the  being for  an  other 
of the organismbjective being in  its  beingJorslj  This  other 
appears  in the first  instance  as  its  outer inorganic  nature  If 
these  two  are  considered  in  relation  to  a  law  the  inorganic 
nature cannot as we saw above constitute the aspect of a  law 
over against the organism because the latter is at the same time 
absolutely for itself and has a universal and free relation to incid
organic nature 

  To define  more precisely however  the relationship of 
these  two  aspects  in  the  organic shape  this  shape  is  in  one 
aspect turned against its inorganic  nature while in  the  other 
it isfor itself and reflected into itself  The actual organism is  the 
middle term which unites the heingjorself of life with the outer 
in  general or with beinginitself  The extreme of beingforself 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
is however the inner as an infinite One which takes back into 
itself out of their subsistence and connection with outer Nature 
the moments of shape itself it is  that which without a content 
of its own gives itself a content in its shape and appears in shape 
as  its process  In this extreme where it is  a  simple negativity or 
a  pure  singular  the  organism  possesses  its  absolute  freedom  in 
virtue of which it is  indifferent towards  and secured against 
beingforother  and  the  determinateness  of the  moments  of 
shape This freedom is at the same time freedom of the moments 
themselves it is their possibility ofappearing as an outer existence 
and of being apprehended as such andjust as in this freedom 
they are free  and  indifferent  towards  this  outer existence  so 
too are they in relation to one another for  the simplicity of this 
freedom  is  being  or is  their simple substance  This  Notion  or 
pure freedom  is  one and  the same life  no  matter how  many 
and varied its shapes or its  beingforother it is  a  matter of incid
difference to this stream oflife what kind ofmils its drives Now 
in  the first  place it is  to  be noted  that  this  Notion is  not to be 
understood here as it was formerly  when we were considering 
the properly inner in its form of process  or the  deveopment of 
its  moments but in its form of a  simple  inner  which constitutes 
the purely universal aspect in contrast to the actual living being 
or as the element in which the existent members of the organic 
shape have their subsistence  For it is  this shape that we are concid
sidering here and in it the essence of life  is  present as  the  simcid
plicity of subsistence In the next placethe beingforother or 
the determinateness of the actual structured shape is  taken up 
into this simple universality which is its essence a determinatecid
ness which is equally simple  universa and noosensuous and 
can only be that which is expressed in number  This determinatecid
ness is  the middle term of the shape which links indeterminate 
life with the actual life simpleJike the former and determinate 
like  the latter  That which in the former  the  inner  would  be 
expressed numerzcally the outer would have to express in accordcid
ance with its mode as  a  multiform actuality viz  as its manner 
of life  colour etc  in general as  the  entire  host of differences 
which are developed in  the  world  of appearance 

  If the two aspects of the organic wholethe one being 
the inner while the other is  the outer in such a  way that each 
again has in its own self an inner and an outerare compared 

C  AA  REASON 

with reference to the inner which each aspect has then the inner 
of the  first  aspect  was  the  Notion  as  the  unrest  of abstraction 
the second  however  has for  its  inner a  quiescent  universality 
which  also involves  a  quiescent  determinateness  number  If 
therefore  the  first  inner  because  the  Notion  develops  its 
moments  in  it  made  a  deceptive  promise  of laws  on  account 
of the show of necessity in  the relationship the second directly 
disclaims doing so since number shows itself to be the determi 
nation of one  aspect of its  laws  For number is just that com 
pletely  quiescent  lifeless  and  indifferent  determinateness  in 
which  all  movement  and  relation  is  extinguished  and  which 
has broken the bridge to the living element of instincts manner 
of life  and  other aspects  of sensuous  existence 

  But to  consider the shape  of the  organism  as  such  and 
the  inner  qua  inner  merely  of the shape  is  in  fact  no  longer 
to consider organic being For the two aspects which were supcid
posed  to  be  related  are posited  as  merely  indifferent  towards 
each other  with  the  result  that  the  reflection  intoself which 
constitutes the essence of the organism is done away with What 
really happens here is  that the attempted comparison of inner 
and outer is  transferred  to inorganic Nature  Here the infinite 
Notion is only the essence which is concealed within or falls withcid
out in selfconsciousness  and no longer as  in  the organism  is 
objectively  present  This  relation  of inner and  outer has  thus 
still  to  be considered in its  own  proper sphere 

  In the first place that inner aspect of shape as the simple 
singuarity  of an inorganic thing is  specific  gravity  As  a  simple 
being  it can  be  observed just  as  well  as  the  determinateness 
of number  of which  alone  it is  capable  or  strictly  speaking 
it can be found by comparing observations and it seems in this 
way  to  give  one  aspect  of the  law  Shape  colour  hardness 
toughness  and  a  countless  host  of  other  properties  would 
together  constitute  the  outer  aspect  and  would  have  to  give 
expression to the determinateness of the inner viz  number so 
that  the  one would  have its  counterpart in  the  other 

  Now  because  negativity  is  understood  here  not  as  a

a simple beingorselj it appears rather as that by which the thing 
resists  the  process  and  inwardly  preserves  itself  as  indifferent 
towards it  But in  virtue of the fact  that this simple beingfor

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
selfis a tranq uil indifference towards an other specific gravity 
appears as one property alongside others and with that all necescid
sary relation of it to this pluraHty in other words all  conformity 
to  law  ceases  Specific  gravity  as  this  simple inner  does  not 
have  the  moment of  difference  within  itself  in  other  words 
the difference it has is only unessential for  it is just its pure simcid
plicity that effaces  all essential distinction  This  unessential difcid
ference  magnitude  must therefore  have  its  counterpart or other 
in  the  other aspect  viz  the  plurality of properties  since  it is 
only through this tha titis difference at all  If this plurality itself 
is  concentrated into the simplicity of the antithesis  and detercid
mined  say  as  cohesion  so  that  this  cohesion  is  a  heingforself 
in  otherness  Gust as  specific  gravity  is  a  pure  beingforself   then 
this cohesion is  in the first  place  pure determinateness  posited 
in the  Notion in contrast  to  that  other  determinateness  and 
the way  of formulating  the law  would  be  that which  we  concid
sidered above  in connection with the relation of sensibility  to 
irri ta bili ty  I n the next place cohesion qua  N olion of beingforcid
self in  otherness  is  further  only  the  abstraction  of the  aspect 
standing over against specific gravity and as such has  no existcid
ence For beingforselfin otherness is  the process in which the 
inorganic would have  to  express  its  beingforself as  a selfprecid
servation  which would secure it from emerging from the process 
as momen t of a  prociuc   Bu t jus t this is  con trary to  its  na ture 
which has  no  purpose or universality in it  Its  process  rather 
is  merely  the specific activity inwhich its  beingforself Ie  its 
specific gravity is  suspended But this specific activity  itself in 
which its cohesion would exist in its true Notion and the specific 
quantity  of  its  specific  gravity  are  Notions  completely  incid
different  towards  each other  If the  way  in  which  they  react 
to  each  other is  left  out of account  and attention  is  confined 
to the idea of quantity  we  could perhaps think of the determicid
nation  Eke  this  that  a  greater specific  weight  as  a  more  incid
tensive beingwithinself would resist involvement in  the  procid
cess more than would a smaller specific weight But conversely 
the freedom of beingforself only proves itself in the  ease  with 
which it enters into relation with everything and preserves itself 
in this multiplicity The said intensity without extension ofrelacid
tions is an empty abstraction for extension constitutes the outer 
existence of intension But the selfpreservation of the inorganic 

C  AA  REASON 

 
in its relation falls  as we have noted outside of its nature since 
the  inorganic  does  not  contain  within  itself  the  principle  of 
movement or in other words because its being is  not absolute 
negativity  and Notion 

  This other aspect of the inorganic  on  the  other hand 

when considered not as process but as  a q uiescen t being is  ordicid
nary cohesion a simple sensuous property standing over against 
the  liberated  moment  of otherness  which  is  separated  into  a 
number of mutually indifferent properties and which like spe 
cific gravity is one of these properties The multiplicity of propcid
erties  together then  constitutes  the  other aspect  of cohesion 
In  this  however  as  in the  other properties  number  is  the  sole 
determinateness and this  not only does  not express  a  relation 
between these properties and a  transition from  one to another 
but is essentially just the absence of any necessary relation and 
it represents  rather  the  abolition of all  conformity  to  law for 
it is  the expression of a  determinateness that is  unessential  This 
being  so  then  a  series  of bodies  in  which  the  difference  is 
expressed  as  a  numerical  difference  of their  specific  gravities 
by no  means  runs  parallel  toa series  in  which  the  difference 
is that of the other properties even if to facilitate  the comparicid
sop  only one or SOme  of them are  taken  For  as  a  matter  of 
fact  only  the  en tire  bundle of properties could  constitu te  the 
otherseries in such a parallel To bring thisintoorder andbind 
it into a whole observation has at its disposal on the one hand 
the quantitative determinatenesses of these various properties 
on  the other hand  however  their differences  are  manifest  as 
qualitative Now in  this  heap of properties what would have 
to  be  characterized  as  positive  or negative  and  as  mutually 
cancelling  each  otherin general  the  internal  arrangement 
and exposition of the formula which would be a  very complicid
cated matterthis would be for  the Notion to  determine  but 
the Notion is excluded by the very manner in which the propercid
ties  are  immediately  there  and  taken  up  In  this  mere  being 
 of the  properties  none  dis pia ys  the  character of a  negative 
over against the other on  the  contrary  one  is just as  well  as 
the other is  nor does  it indicate in  any other way its  place in 
the arrangement of the whole  In the case of a series which procid
gresses with parallel differenceswhether the relation is  meant 
to be one of simultaneous increase on both sides or of increase 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
only  on one  and decrease  on the  otherwhat is  of interest  is 
only thefinal simple expression of this  combined whole  which 
was supposed  to  constitute  one  aspect of the  law over against 
specific gravity but this one aspect as a given  result  is  precisely 
nothing  else  than  what  has  already  been  mentioned  viz  a 
single  property  say  like  ordinary  cohesion  alongside  which 
the indifferent others specific gravity among them are found 
and each of the others can with equal right ie  with equal incid
correctness be taken as  representative of the entire other side 
the one like the other would merely represent  reprasentieren 
in German vorstellen  the essential nature but would not itself 
be  that essential  nature  So that  the  attempt  to  find  series  of 
bodies  which  would  run  simply  parallel  to  each  other  and 
would  express  the  essential  nature of the  bodies  according  to 
a law of these two series must be regarded as  a conception that 
is  ignorant of its  task  and of the  means  whereby it should  be 
carried out 

  Previously  the  connection  of inner  and  outer  in  the 
organic shape which is supposed  to be present to observation 
was straightway transferred to the sphere of the inorganic The 
determination which produced this  transfer  can now  be  more 
precisely  indicated  and  resulting  therefrom  we  have  still 
anotherform and connection of this relationship Namely what 
in the case of the inorganic seems to offer the possibility of such 
a  comparison of inner and outer  in  the case  of the  organism 
is altogetherabsent The inorganic inner is a simple inner which 
presents  itself to  perception  as  a  property  that  merely  is   its 
determinateness  is  therefore  essentially  magnitude  and  as  a 
property that merely is it appears indifferent towards the outer 
or the various other sensuous properties  But the beingforself 
of the living organism does  not stand on  one side  in  this  way 
over  against  its  outer  on  the  contrary  it  has  in  its  own  self 
the  principle  of otherness  If we  define  beingforself as  simple 
selfpreserving relationtoself then its otherness is simple negativity 
and organic unity is  the  unity of a selfidentical relatingtoself 
and  pure negativity  This  unity  is  qua  unity  the  inwardnes 
of the organism this  is  thereby in itself universal or it is  genus 
But the freedom of the genus in relation to its actual existence 
is  different from  the  freedom  of specific  gravity  in  relation  to 
shape That of the latter is  a  freedom  that  merely  is  in other 

q 

C  AA  REASON 

words specific  gravity  as  a  particular property stands  on  one 
side  But because it is  a  freedom  that merely is  it is  also  only 
a  determinateness  which  essentzally  belongs  to  this  shape  or 
whereby  this shape  qua  essential  being  is  something  determi 
nate The freedom of the genus however is  a universal freedom 
and is  indifferent towards  this  shape  or  towards  its  actuality 
The determinateness which attaches to  the heingforseLJ of the incid
organic as  such falls  therefore in the case of organic being under 
its beingforselfjust as in the case of the inorganic it falls  only 
uncler the heing of the latter  Hence although determinateness 
in  the inorganic is  at the  same  time  present only as  a property 
yet it acquires the dignity of essential being because as  a simple 
negative it stands over against outer existence which is  a beingcid
foranother  and  this  sirppIe  negative is  in  its  ultimate single 
determinateness a  number  The organic being  however  is  a 
singular individual which is  itself pure negativity  and therecid
fore  destroys  within  itself  the  fixed  determinateness  which 
attaches to indiJIerent being  In so far  therefore as  it has  within 
it the moment of indifferent beingandso too of number this 
latter  can  be  taken  as  merely  a  byproduct  but  not  as  the 
essence of its  vitality 

  But now  though  pure negativity  the  principle of the 
process does not fall  outside of the  organism which  therefore 
does  not have it in its  essence  as  a  determinateness  the  single 
individual being itself intrinsically universal yet in the organ 
ism the moments of this pure individual are not developed and 
actual as moments whichare themselves abstract or universal  On 
the contrary this  their expression appears outside of that unicid
versality which falls  back in to the inwardness  of the organism 
and between the actual existence or shape ie  the selfdevelopcid
ing individual and  the  organic  universal  or  the  genus  there 
comes  the determinate  universal  the species  The concrete existcid
ence attained  by  the  negativity  of the  universal  or  the  genus 
is  only  the  developed  movement  of a  process  which  runs  its 
course in the parts of the  inert  existence of the  shape  If the genus 
as  a  quiescent unitary being  had  within  it  the  differentiated 
parts and if  too  its  simple  negativity  as  such were at  the same 
time a movement which ran through parts which were equally 
simple  and  immediately universal  in  themselves  parts  which 
here  were  actual  as  such  moments  then  the  organic  genus 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
woud  be consciousness  But  as  it is  the  simple  determinateness 
qua  determinateness  of the  species  is  present in  the  genus  in 
a  nonspiritual  manner  actuality  starts  from  the  genus  or 
what enters into actual  existence  is  not the  genus  as  such  ie 
in general not the thought of it The genus as  an actual organcid
ism is  merely represented by a surrogate by number  This latcid
ter number seems  to mark the  transition from  the genus  into 
the  individual  structured  shape  and  to  provide  observation 
with  the  two  necessary  aspects  of the  latter  one  as  a  simple 
determinateness  and  the  other  as  a  shape  whose  manifold 
nature is  fully  developed  This number  however  really indicid
cates the indifference and freedom of the universal and the incid
dividual in relation to one another the genus  puts  the indivicid
dual at the  mercy of the nonessential  quantitative difference 
but the  individual  itself  qua  living  individual equally shows 
itself to befree True universality as we have defined it is  here 
only an inner essence  as  determinateness of the  species  it is  a  formal 
universality and over against this  the  true  universality takes 
its stand on the side of the single  individual which is  thereby 
a  living  individual  and  in  virtue  of its  inner  being  takes  no 
account of its determinateness as species  But this individual is  not 
at the same  time a  universal individual  ie  one in which  the 
universality would have an outer actual existence  as  well the 
universal  individual  falls  outside  of the  living organism  This 
universal  individual  however  as  immediately  the  individ ual  of 
natural structured shapes  is  not consciousness  itself  its  existcid
ence as  a  single  organic  living  indzvidual  must not fall  outside  of 
it  if it is  to  be  consciousness 

  Consequently  we  have  a  syllogism  in  which  one 
extreme is theuniversallije as  a universal  or as  genus  the other 
extreme however being the same universal as a single individual 
or as  a universal individual but the middle term is  composed 
of both  the first  seems  to  fit  itselfinto it as  a  determinate  unicid
versality or as species  the other  however  as individuality proper 
or  as  a  single  individual  And  since  this  syllogism  pertains 
wholly to the aspect of the structured shape it equally embraces 
within its  scope what is  distinguished  as  inorganic Nature 

  Now since the universal life  qua the simple essence of the 
genus  develops from its side the differences of the Notion  and 
must exhibit them as  a series of simple determinatnesses this 

C  AA  REASON 

series is a system of differences posited as  mutually indifferent 
or is  a numerical series  Whereas previously the organism in the 
form  of a single individual was set over against this essenceless 
difference  which  neither  expresses  nor  contains  its  living 
nature  and  whereas just the same must  be said  in  respect  of 
the inorganic  taking it as  an existence in which  the whole of 
its properties are developed it is  now the universal individual 
we have to consider and not merely as free from any systematcid
ization of the genus but also as the power controlling the genus 
The genus  which divides itself into species on the basis of the 
general  determinateness  of number  or  which  may  adopt  as  its 
principle  of division  particular  features  of its  existence  eg 
shape  colour  etc  while  peacefully  engaged  in  this  activity 
suffers violence from  the universal individual the  Earth  which 
as the universal negativity preserves the differences as they exist 
within itselftheir nature on account of the substance to which 
they  belong  being  different  from  the  nature  of those  of the 
genusand in face  of the  systematization  of the genus  This 
action of the genus comes to he a quite restricted affair which 
itis permitted to carryon only inside those powerful elements 
and which is interrupted incomplete and curtailed on aU sides 
by  their unchecked  violence 

  It follows  from  this  that  in existence  in its  structured 
shape observation can encounter Reason only as  life in general 
which however in its differentiating process does not actually 
possess  any rational  ordering  and  arrangement  of parts  and 
is not an immanently grounded system of shapes  If in the sylcid
logism  of organic  structured  shapes  the  middle  term  which 
cqntains the species and its actuality as a  single individuality 
hadinits own sefthe extremes ofinner universality and ofumcid
versaLindividuality  then  this middle term  would  have in the 
movement  of its actuality the expresion and  the nature of unicid
versality and would be a selfsystematizing development It is 
thus  that consciousness  as  the  middle  term  between  universal 
Spirit  and  its individuality  or  senseconsciousness  has  for 
middle term the system  of structured shapes assumed  by concid
sciousness  as  a  selfsystematizing  whole  of the  life  of Spiritcid
the system that we are considering here and which has its objeccid
tive existence as  worldhistory But organic Nature as no hiscid
tory it falls from its universal from life directly into the single  

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
ness of existence  and  the moments of simple determinateness 
and the single organic life united in this actuality produce the 
process  of  Becoming  merely  as  a  contingent  movement  in 
which each is active in its own part and the whole is preserved 
but this activity is restricted so far as itselfis concerned merely 
to its centre  because the whole is  not present in it  and is  not 
present in it  because  here it is  not  qua  wholefor itself 

  Apart  then  from  the fact  that  Reason  in observing 

organic Nature attains only to a contemplation of itself as unicid
versallife as such it comes to see its development and realizacid
tion merely in the form of systems distinguished quite generally 
whose  essential  character lies  not in  the  organic  as  such  but 
in the universal indi vidual the Earth  and it sees that d evelopcid
ment and realization among  these differences  belonging  to the 
Earth in the form  of arrangements  which  the genus  attempts 
to achieve 

  Since then the universality qf organic life falls in its actucid

ality directly into the extreme of singleness without a genuine 
mediation of its  own  the  thing  before  the  observing  Reason 
is only something meant and if Reason can take an idle intercid
estin observing this meant thing it is restricted to the descripcid
tion  and  narration  of the  meanings  and  fanciful  conceits  it 
finds in Nature This unspiritual freedom of meaning  will  it 
is  true  offer  on  all  sides  the  beginnings  of laws  traces  of 
ncessi ty allusions to order and system ingenious and plausible 
connections But as  regards law and necessity  when observa  
tion connects the organic with the merely given differences  of 
theinorganic the elements zones and climates it does not get 
beyond theideaofa great influence So too on the other side 
where individuality has the significance not of the  Earth  but 
of the oneness immanent in life and where this in immediate unity 
with the universal does indeed constitute the genus the simple 
unityofwhich however isjustfor that reason determined only 
as number and therefore sets free the qualitative manifestation 
here observation cannotdo more than to make clever remark 
indicate interesting connections and make a friendly approach 
to  the  Notion  But  clever  remarks  are  not  a  knowledge  of 
necessity  interesting  connections  go  no  further  than  being  of 
interest while the interest is  still nothing more than a  subjeccid
tive opinion about Reason and thefriendliness with which  the 

IBo 

C  AA  REASON 

individual alludes to  a  Notion is  a childlike friendliness  which 
is  childish if it wants  to  be  or is  supposed  to  be  valid  in and 
for  itself 

b  Observation  of selfconsciousness  in  its purity  and  zn  its  relation  to 
external  actuality  Logical  and psychological  laws 

g  Observation of Nature finds  the Notion realized in incid

organic Nature laws whose moments are things which  at  the 
same time have the character of abstractions but this  Notion 
is not a simplicity that is reflected into itself The life of organic 
Nature on the other hand is only this introreflected simplicity 
the  antithesis  within  it of universal  and  individual  does  not 
sunder itself in the essence of this  life  itself  The essence is  not 
the genus which in its undifferentiated element would be self  
sundered and selfmoved  and at the same  time  would  be  for 
itself  undifferentiated in its  antithesis  Observation finds  this 
free  Notion  whose  universality  contains  just  as  absolutely 
within  it developed  individu ali tYI  only  in  the  Notion  which 
itself exists  at N olion  ie  in selfconsciousness 

  When observation now turns in upon itself and directs 
its  attention to  the  Notion existing  as  free  Notion it  finds  to 
bgin  with  the  Laws  ofFhought  This  individuality  which 
Thought isin its ownselfis the abstract movement of the negacid
tive  a  movement  wholly  retracted  into  simplicity  and  he 
Laws are outside of reality  To say  that they  have  no  reality 
means in general nothing else than that they lack truth They 
are indeed  not supposed  to  be  the entire  truth  but still formal 
truth But what is  purely formal without any reality is  a  mere 
figmentof thought  or pure abstraction without that internal 
division which would be nothing else but the contentOn the 
other hand however since they are Laws of pure thought and 
pure thought is  intrinsically  universal  and  therfore a  knowcid
ledge which immediately contains being and therein all reality 
these Laws are absolute Notions and are inseparably the essencid
tial principles both ofform and of things  Since immanent self  
moving universality is the sundered simple Notion the latter thus 
has in itself a  content  and  one  which  is  all  content  only not a 
sensuous being It is a content which is neither in contradiction 
with the form nor is separated atal from it rather it is essenti

OBSER VING  REASON 

ally the form itself for the latter is nothing else but the universal 
dividing itself into its  pure moments 

  But the way in which  this form  or content presents  ztself 
to  observation qua observation gives it the character of something 
found  something  that is  given  ie  a  content  that merely  is  It 
becomes  a  quiescent  being  of relations  a  multitude of detached 
necessities which  as  in and  for  themselves  a fixed  content  are 
spposed to  have  truth in  their  determinateness  and  thus  are  in 
fact  withdrawn  from  the form  This  absolute  truth  of fixed 
determinatenesses  or  of a  number  of  different  Laws  concid
tradicts however the unity of selfconsciousness or of thought 
and form  in general  What is  asserted  to  be a  fixed  Law that 
is  in itself constant can only  be a  moment of the  unity which 
is  reflected  into itself  can only appear as  a  vanishing  magnicid
tude But  torn  out of this  context of movement in  the course 
of considering them and represented separately it is  not concid
tent that they lack for they possess a definite content but rather 
form  which  is  their  essence  In  point  of fact  these  Laws  are 
not the  truth of thought  not because they are supposed  to  be 
merely  formaland  to  possess  no  content  but rather  for  the 
opposite  reason  viz  that  they  are  supposed  in  their  detercid
minateness  or just as  a content  from  which  form  has  been  re 
lnoved to rankas something absolute  In their truth as vanishcid
ing moments in  the  unity of thought  they  would  have  to  be 
taken as  a  knowing  or as  a  movement of thought  but not as 
Laws of being But observing is not knowing  itself  and is  ignorant 
of it it converts  its  own  nature  into  the form  of being  ie  it 
grasps its negativity only as laws of knowing It is sufficient here 
to  have  pointed  out  the  invalidity  of the  socalled  Laws  of 
Thought from the general nature of the case The more precise 
development belongs  to speculative  philosophy in which  they 
show themselves to be what they are in truth viz single vanishcid
ing  moments  whose  truth  is  only  the  whole  movement  of 
thought  knowing  itself 

  This negative unity of thought isfor itself  or rather it 
is  beingforitsownselj  the principle of individuality and in its 
actuality is active consciousness  Consequently the observing concid
sciousness  will  by  the nature of the case  be  led  towards  this 
as  the  actuality  of  those  laws  Since  this  connection  is  not 
explicit  for 
the  observing  consciousness  it  supposes  that 

C  AA  REASON 

thought  in its  Laws  remains over  on  one  side  and  that  on 
the other side it obtains another being in what is now an object 
for  it  viz  the  active  consciousness  which  is for  itself in  such 
a way that it supersedes otherness and in this intuition of itself 
as  the negative  has  its  actuality 

  A new field  thus opens  up for  observation in  the behacid
viour of consciousness in its actuality Psychology con tains the colleccid
tion oflaws in accordance with vhich Spirit relates itselfin varicid
ous  ways  to  the  various  modes  of its  actuality  as  an  otherness 
already given  On the one hand Spirit receives  these modes into 
itself  conforming to the  habits customs  and  way  of thinking 
already  to  hand  as  being  that  in  which  it  is  an  actuality  or 
an object to itself  and  on  the other hand  Spirit knows  itself 
as spontaneously active in face of them and in singling out from 
them  something for  itself  it follows  its  own  inclinations  and 
desires  making  the  object  conform  to  it  in  the  first  case  it 
behaves  negatively  towards  itself as  an  individuality  in  the 
second  case  negatively  towards  itself as  a  universal  being 
According  to  the first  aspect  independence  gives  to  what  is 
already there merely theJorm of selfconscious individuality as 
such  and  as  regards  the  content  remains  within  the  general 
actuality already given according to the second aspect it gives 
the actuality at  least  a  peculiar  modification  which  does  not 
contradict its essential content or one even whereby the indivi 
dual qua particular actuality with a peculiar content sets itself 
in  opposition  to  the  general  actuality  an  opposition  which 
becomes wrongdoing or crime when it sets  aside that actuality 
in a merely individual manner or when it does thisin a general 
way and thus for all putting another world another right law 
and  customs  in place of those already existing 

  Observational  psychology  which  in  the  first  instance 
records its  perceptions of the general  modes  coming  to its  notice 
in  the  active  consciousness  comes  across  all  sorts  of faculties 
inclinations  and  passions  and  since  while  recounting  the 
details  of this  collection  it  cannot  help  recaJing  the  unity  of 
selfconsciousness it must at least go so far as  to  be astonished 
that such a  contingent medley of heterogeneous beings can  be 
together in the mind like things in a  hag more especially since 
they show  themselves  to  be  not dead inert  things  but restless 
movements 

  Observation  in  recounting  these  various  faculties  is 

OBSER V ING  REASON 

keeping  to  the  universal  aspect  the  unity  of these  manifold 
capacities is  the opposite  aspect  to this  universality  the actual 
individuality  However  to  take  up again in  this  way the  discid
tinctive actual individualities and to recount that one man has 
more inclination for  this  another for  that  that one  has  more 
intelligence than another all this is  much less  interesting even 
than enumerating the species of insects  mosses  etc  for  these 
give  observation  the  right  to  take  them  thus  singly  and  un 
comprehendingly  because  they  belong  essentially  to  the  elecid
ment  of contingent  particularization  On  the  other  hand  to 
take conscious individuality unintelligently as a  manifestation 
that is  single  and  separate  involves  a  contradiction  since  its 
essential nature is the universal of Spirit But since observation 
in apprehending it endows it with the form  of universality  it 
finds its law  and seems  now  to  have a  rational  aim  and  to  be 
engaged  in a  necessary  activity 

  The momGlts  constituting  the  content of the law are 
on the one  hand  dl individuality  itself  on  the  other  hanel 
its  universal  inorgapic  nature  viz  the  given  circumstances 
situation  habits  customs  religion  and  so  on from  the the 
specific  individuality  is  to  be  comprehended  They  embrace 
specific as well as  universal element and  are at the same time 
something  given  something  which  provides  material  for 
observation  and  which  on the other  hand  expresses  itself in 
the form  of individuality 

  Now the law of this relation of the two sides would have 

to state the kind of effect and influence exerted on the individucid
ality by these speCific circumstances But this individuality concid
sists precisely both in being the universal and hence directly and 
unresistingly  coalescing  with  the given  universal  the  customs

itselfin opposition to them and in fact  transforming them and 
again in behaving towards them in its individuality with COIOcid
plete indifference neither letting them exert an influence on it 
nor being active  against  them  Therefore  what  is  to  have  an 
influence on the individuality and what kind  of influence it is 
to havewhich really mean the same thingdepend solely on 
the individuality itself to say that by such and suchan influence

situation  customs  etc  which on the one  hand  are shown  as 
already there and on the other hand as present in this specific indivicid
duality  express only the indeterminate nature of the individucid
ality  which is  not  the  point under consideration  If these circid
cumstances  way of thinking  customs  in general  the  state  of 
the world  had  not been  then of course  the individual would 
not have become what he is  for  all  those elements  present in 
this  state of the  world are  this  universal substance  The fact 
however that the state of the world has particularized itself in 
this particular individualand it is  such  an individual  that  is 
to  be  comprehendedimplies that it must also  have  particucid
larized itselfonitsown account and have operated on an indivi 
dual in this specific character which it has given itself Qnly  in 
this way would it have made itself into this specific individual 
that he is If the constitution which the external world has sponcid
taneously given itself is  that which is  manifest in the individucid
ality  the latter would be comprehended from  the former  We 
should  have a  double gallery of pictures  one of which would 
be the  reflection  of the other  the one  the gallery of external 
circumstances which  completely determine  and  circumscribe 
the individual  the other  the same gallery translated into the 
form n which those circumstances are present in the conscious 
individual  the  former  the  spherical  surface  the  latter  the 
centrewhich represents  that surface  within it 

  But the spherical surface  the world of the individual 
has at once an ambiguous meaning it is  the actual state of the 
world as it is  in and for itself and it is  the world  of the indivicid
dual it is the latter either in so far as the individual has merely 
coalesced with that world has let itjust as itis enter into him 
behaving towards  it as  a  merely  formal  consciousness  or  on 
the  other hand  it is  the  world  of the individual  in  the  sense 
that the actual world as given has been transformed by the indivicid
dual  Since  on  account  of this  freedom  the  actual  world  is 
capable of having this twofold meaning the world of the indivicid
dual is  to  be comprehended only from  the individual himself 
and the nftuence on theinclividual of the actual world conceived 
as existing in and for itself  receives  through the individual  the 
absolutely opposite ignificance viz  that the individual either 
allows free pIa y to the stream of the actual world flowing in upon 
it or else breaks it off and transforms it The result of this how

OBSERVING  REASON 

ever is that psychological necessity becomes an empty phrase 
so empty that there exists  the absolute  possibility  hat what is 
supposed to have had this influence could just as  well  not have 
had  it 

B  Thus there is  no question of a  being  which  would  be in 
andfor itselfand was supposed to constitute one aspect and the 
universal aspect at that ofa law Individuality is what its world 
is  the world  that is  its  own  Individuality is  itself the  cycle  of 
its  action in  which  it has  exhibited  itself as  an  actual  world 
and  as simply  and  solely  the  unity  of the  world  as  given  and 
the world  it  has  made  a  unity  whose  sides  do  not  fall  apart 
as in the conception of psychological law  into a  world  that in 
itself is  already given  and  an individuality existing on  its  own 
account Or if those sides are thus considered each by itself there 
exists  no  necessity  and  no  law  of their  connection  with  one 
another 

c  Observation qfthe rlation of selfconsciousness to  its immediate actucid
ality  Physiognomy  and  Phrenology 

  Psychological observation discovers no law for the recid

lation  of selfconsciousness  to  actuality  or  to  the world  over 
against it  and  through the mutual indifference of both  it is 
forced to fall back on the peculiar determinalenessofreal individucid
ality which exists  in  and for  itself  or contains  the  antithesis of 
beingfor itselfand being in itself effaced within its own absolute 
mediation  Individuality  has  now  become  the  object  for 
observation  or  the object to which observation  now turns 

  The individual exists in and for himself he isfor himself 
or is  a  free  activity  but he  has also  an  illtrinsic  being  or  has 
an  original determinate  being  of his  owna determinateness 
which is in principle  the same as  what psychology thought to 
find  outside of him  In  his  own  self  therefore  there  emerges 
the antithesis this duality ofbeing the movement of consciouscid
ness and the fixed being of an appearing actuality an actuality 
which in the individual is immediately his own  This being  the 
body  of the specific individuality is  the atters original  aspect 
that aspect in  the  making of which it has  not  itself played  a 
part  But since  the  individual is  at  the  same  time  only  what 
he has  done  his  body is  also  the  expression  of himself which 

C  AA  REASON 

 
he has himself produced  it is  at the same time a  sign  which has 
not remained an immediate fact  but something  through which 
the individual only makes known  what  he  really  is  when  he 
sets  his  original  nature  to  work 

 I  I  Ifwe consider the morrtents here before us in relation to 
the previous view we have here a  general human shape or at 
least the general character of a  climate a continent  a  people 
just as previously we had the same general customs and culture 
In addition  there are the  particular circumstances and  situacid
tion within the general sphere of actuality here this particular 
actuality is  present  as  a  particular formation  of the  shape  of 
the  individual  On  the  other side  just  as  previously  the  free 
activity  of the  individual was  made  explicit  as  also  the  fact 
of his own actuality in the face of the actuality already given here 
the  shape  stands  for  the  expression  of his  own  actualization 
established  by  the  individual  himself  the  lineaments  and 
forms  of  his  spontaneously  active  being  But  the  actuality 
both  general  and  particular  which  observation  previously 
found  given  outside of the individual is  here  the  actuality  of 
the individual his inherited body and it is precisely in this that 
the expression originating from his activity appears From the 
psychological point of view actuality in and for  itself and the 
specificindividualitywere supposed to be broughtintorelation 
to one another  here  however  the  whole  specific individuality 
is  the object of observation  and each side  of the  antithesis  is 
itself the whole To the outer whole therefore belongs not only 
the original being  the inherited body but equally the formation 
of the body resulting from  the activity of the inner being  the 
body is the unity of the unshaped and of the shaped being and 
is  the  individuals  actuality  permeated  by  his  beingforself 
This whole which contains within it the specific original fixed 
parts and the lineaments arising solely from the activity is and 
this heing  is  the expression  of the inner being of the  individual 
posited as consciousness and movement This inner being is  too 
no longer a formal  spontaneous activity devoid  of content or 
indeterminate an activity whose content and determinateness 
as  before  was  the case  lay  in  external  circumstances  on  the 
contrary  it is  an  intrinsically  determined  original  character 
whose  form  is  merely  the  activity  We  have  then  to  consider 
here how to determine the relation between these two sides and 

OBSERVING  REASON 

what is to be understood by this expression of the inner in the 
outer 

 I   This outer  in the first  place  acts  only  as  an  organ  in 
making  the  inner  visible  or  in  general  a  beingforanother 
for  the inner in so far as  it is  in  the organ  is  the activity  itself 
The speaking mouth the  working hand  and  if you  like  the 
legs too are the organs of performance and actualization which 
have within them  the action qua  action  or the inner as such 
But  the  externality  which  the  inner obtains  through  them  is 
the action as  a  reality separated from  the  individual  Speech 
and  work  are  outer  expressions  in  which  the  individual  no 
longer keeps and possesses  himself wi thin himself  but lets  the 
inner get completely outside of him leaving it to the mercy of 
something other than himself For that reason we can say with 
equal truth that these expressions express the inner too  much 
as  that they do so too little  too much because the inner itself 
breaks out  in  them  and  there  remains  no  antithesis  between 
them and  it  they give  not  merely  an  expression  of the  inner 
but directly the inner itself  too  little  because  in speech  and 
action  the inner turns itself into something  else  thus  putting 
itself at the mercy of the element of change which  twists  the 
spoken word nd the accomplished act into meaning something 
else than they are in and for themselves as  actions of this par  
ticular  individual  Not  only  do  the  results  of  the  actions 
through  this  externality  of the  influences  of others  Jose  the 
character of being something constant in face  of other indivicid
dualities but since intheir relationship to the inner which they 
contain they behave asa separated indifferent externality they 
can qua  inner through  the individual himself  be something other 
than  they  appear  to  be  either  the  individual  intentionally 
makes them  appear to  be other than what they are in  truth 
or else he is  too clumsy to give himself the outer aspect he really 
wanted  and  to  establish it so  firmly  that his  work  cannot  he 
misconstrued byothers The action then as a completed work 
has the double and opposite meaning of being either the  inner 
individuality and not its expression  or qua external a  reality free 
from the inner a reality which is something quite different from 
the inner On account of this ambiguity we must look around 
for  the inner as  it still  is  within  the individual  himself  but in 
a visible or external shape  In the organ  hovever  it is present 

 

O  AA  REASON 

only as the immediate activity itself  which attains its externalcid
ization  in  the  deed  which  either  does  or  again  does  not 
represent  the  inner  The  organ  regarded  in  the  light  of this 
antithesis  does  not  therefore  provide  the  expression  which  is 
sought 

   Ifnow the outer shape could express the inner individucid

ality  only  in  so  far  as  that shape  is  neither  an  organ  nor  an 
action  hence  only  in  so  far  as  it is  a  passive  whole  it  would 
behave as an existent Thing which passively received the inner 
as  an  alien  element  into  its  passive  existence  and  thereby 
became a sign of itan external contingent expression  whose 
actual aspect lacked any meaning of its owna language whose 
sounds and soundcombinations are not the real thing itself but 
are linked with it by sheer caprice and are contingent in relation 
toit 

  Such  an  arbitrary  combination  of  factors  that  are 
external  for  one  another yields  no  law  Physiognomy  howcid
ever is sllpposedto differ from other questionable arts and percid
niciousstudies because it considers specific individuality in the 
necessary  antithesis of an inner and an outer  of character as  a 
conscious disposition and this again as  an existent shape  and 
the way it relates  these factors to  each other is  the  way  they 
are related by their Notion  hence these factors must constitute 
the  content  of a  law  In astrology  palmistry  and  similar 
sciences  on  the other handwhat seems to  be  related  is  only 
an outer to an outer  something or other to  an  element  aUen 
to  it  This  particular  GonsteHation  at  birth  and  when  this 
external element is  brought closer to the body these particular 
lines  on  the  hand  are  external  factors  indicating  a  longer  or 
shorter life and the fate in general of the particular individual 
Being externali ties they are indifferent towards each other and 
lack the necessi tyfor one another tha tough t to He in the relation 
of an outer to an inner 

  Admittedly the hand does  not seem  to  be such a  very 
external factor  for  fate  it seems  rather  to  be  related  to  it as 
something inner  For fate  itself is  also  only  the  manifestation 
of what the particular individuality is in itself as  an ipner otigicid
nal specific character Now to find out what this particular incid
dividualityis in itself the palmist like the physiognomist takes 
a shorter cut than eg Solon who though t he could only know 

OBSERVING  REASON 

g 

this  from  and  after  the  course  of the  whole  life  he  examined 
the manifestation but the former examines the unexplicated 
initself  That the  hand  however  must  represent  the  in  itself 
of the individuality in respect of its fate is easy to  see  from  the 
fact  that  next  to  the  organ  of speech  it  is  the  hand  most  of 
aU  by which a  man  manifests  and  actualizes  himself  It is  the 
living  artificer  of his  fortune  We  may  say  of the  hand  that 
it  is  what a  man does  for  in it  as  the active organ of his  self  
fulfilment  he  is  present  as  the  animating soul  and  since  he 
is  primarily  his  own  fate  his  hand  will  thus  express  this  in  
itself 

 I   From this nature of the organ of activi ty to be a passive 
being  as  well  as  the  action  within  it  or from  the  fact  that  the 
in  itselfness  is  itself present in  it  and  has  a  being for  others  we 
obtain  another view  of it than  the  preceding  Namely  if the 
organs in general showed  themselves  to  be incapable of being 
taken as expressions of the inner  because in  them the action qua 
action is present  butthe action qua  completed deed is  merely 
external  and inner and  outer in  this  way  fall  apart  and  are 
or  can  be  alien  to  each  other  then  the  organ  must  now  in 
accordance with its nature be taken again as also a middle term 
of both This very fact that the action is present in it constitutes 
an externality  of it  and  moreover  one  that is  other  than  the 
deed for the organ remains with and in  the individual  Now 
this middle term and unity ofinner and outer is in the first place 
itself external too  But then this externality is at the same time 
taken  up  into  the  inner  as  simple  externality  it stands  over 
against the dispersed externality which either is merely a single 
deed or condition contingent for  the  individuality as  a  whole 
or else as  a total externality is  fate split up into a  multiplicity 
of deeds and conditions Thus the simple lines of the hand  the 
timbre and compass of the voice as  the individual characteristic 
of speechthis  too  again  as  expressed  in  writing  where  the 
hand  gives  it a  more  durable  existence  than  the  voice  does 
especially in the particular style of handwritingall this is  an 
expression of the inner so that as a simple externality  the expres m 
sion again stands over against  the  manifold externality  of action 
and fate  stands in relation  to  them as  an inner  Thus irat first 
the  specific  nature  and  innate  peculiarity  of the  individual 
together with what these have become as a result of cuhivation 

c  AA  REASON 

and education are taken as the inner as the essence of his action 
and his fate then this essence has its appearance and externality 
to  begin  with  in  his  mouth  hand  voice  handwriting  and  the 
other organs  and  their  permanent  characteristics  Thereafter 
and  not till then  does  it give itselfJurther outward  expression 
in its  actual existence in  the  world 

 I    Now  because this middle term gives itself the form  of 
an outer expression which is  at the same time taken back into 
the inner its existence is  not restricted  to the immediate organ 
of the action the midde term is rather the movement and form 
of countenance  and  figure  in general  which  take  no  part in 
the action These lineaments and their movements are accordcid
ing  to  this  notion  the  action  which  is  held  back  and  which 
remains in the individual and as  regards the individuals relacid
tion to the action really performed they constitute his own concid
trol and  observation of the  action  expression  in  the  sense  of a 
reflection on the actual expression The individual is  therefore not 
dumb as  regards  his external action  because he is  thereby at 
once reflected into himself and gives  expression  to this  refleccid
tednessintoself  This  theoretical  action  or  the  individuals 
speech with himself ahout the external action  is  also  percepcid
tible  to  others  for  this speech is  itself an expression 

  In this inner therefore which in its expression remains 
an inner  there  is  observed  the  individual  as  reflected  out  of 
his  actual  being  and we  have  to see  what  is  the  significance 
of this necessity which is posited in this unity This reflectedness 
is in the first place different from  the deed  itself and  therefore 
can  be something other than the  deed  and  can  be  taken for 
something other  We  see  from  a  mans  face  whether  he  is  in 
earnest about what he is saying or doing  Conversely  however 
what is  here supposed  to  be  the  expression  of the  inner is  at 
the same time an expression in the form of immediate being and 
hence is  itself degraded  to  the level  of mere  being  which is 
absolutely contingent for the selfconscious heing  It is therefore 
indeed  an expression  but at the same  time  only in  the  sense 
of a  sign  so  that  the  particular  way  in  which  the  content  is 
expressed is a matter of compete indifference so far as the concid
tent itselfis concerned In this appearance the inner is no doubt 
a  visible  invisible but it is  not tied  to this  appearance  it  can 
be manifested just as well in another way just as  another inner 

OBSER VING  REASON 

 
can be manifested in the same appearance Lichtenberg   therecid
fore rightly says Suppose the physiognomist ever did take the 
measure ofa man it would only require  a  courageous resolve 
on the part of the man to make himself incomprehensible again 
for  a  thousand  years 

Just as in the previous relationship the given circumstances 
were a passive  being from  which the individuality took what 
it could and wanted either submitting to or transforming that 
being  for  which  reason  it  did  not  contain  the  necessity  and 
essential nature of the individuality so  here  the manifest imcid
mediate being of the individuality is one which either expresses 
the fact of its  being reflected out of its  actual existence  and its 
being within itself  or which is  fr  the  individuality  merely  a 
sign  indifferent  to  what is  signified  therefore  truly  signifying 
nothing for  the individuality it is  as much its countenance as 
its  mask  which it can  lay  aside  The individuality  permeates 
its shape moves and speaks init but this existence in its entirety 
equally turns into a being that is indifferent to the will and the 
deed  Individualityeffaces from  it the significance  it formerly 
hld  viz  of being that in  which  the  individuality is  reflected 
into itself or has  its  true  essence  instead  it  places  its  essence 
rather in  the  will  and  the deed 

I  Individuality gives  up that rejlectednessintoselfwhich is 
expressed in lines  and lineamentsand places its  essence  in  the  work

supposed to be This pointofview leads us  to the thought which 
really lies  at  the  base  of the  scienceif one  wishes  to  call it 
suchof physiognomy  The antithesis  which  this  observation 
encounters has  the form  of the  antithesis  of the practical  and 
the theoretical both falling within the practical aspect itselfcid

durable reality  but it is  the beingwithinself of the individucid
ality which is for it the essential inner Of the two aspects possessed 
by  the  practical  consciousness  intention  and  deed  what  is 
meant or intended by the deed and the deed itself  observacid
tion  selects  the former as  the  true inner  the in tention is  supcid
posed to have its more or less  unessential expression in the deed 
but it has its  true expression in the shape of the individuality 
The latter expression is the immediate sensuous presence of the 
individual spirit  the inwardness which is  supposed  to  be  the 
true inner is the particularity of the intention and the singleness 
of the beingforself both together are the spirit as only meane 
or intended What observation has for its objectsis thus an existcid
ence which is only meant and it looks for laws between such 
existences 

  The forming of opinions prima facie about the presumed 

outward  presence  of Spirit  is  natural  or everyday  physiogcid
nomy the overhasty judgement formed at first sight about the 
inner nature and character of its outershape The object of this 
opinion is  of such a  kind  that is essence involves  its  being in 
truth something  else  than  merely sensuous  immediate  being 
True it s  also just this  reflectedness  into  itself  out  bfsense 
in sensuous form  and this which is  visibly  present as  visibility 
of the invisible  is  the object of observation  But just this  sencid
suous immediate presence is  the reality  of Spirit only for  mere 
opinion  and observation in  keeping  with  this  aspect  busies 
itselfwith this presumed existence of Spirit with physiognomy 
handwriting sound ofvoice etc It connects such existence with 
just such a presumed inner It is not the murderer the thief  who 
is to be recognized but the capacity  to  be one  The fixed  abstract

Such ingenious delineations certainlysaymore than the qualificid

is  qua  a  being  that is  meant  inexpressible  The  science  of 
knowing men   which deals  with the supposed  human being 
like the science of physiognomy which deals with his presumed 
reality and aims at raising the unconscious judging of everyday 
physiognomy to the level of knowledge is  therefore something 
which lacks both foundation and finality  it can never succeed 
in saying what it means because it merely  means  and its  concid
tent is  something merely  meant 

 I  The laws  which  this  science  sets  out  to find  are relacid
tions between these two supposed aspects and hence can themcid
selves  be  nothing more than empty subjective opinions  Also 
since the object of this supposed  way  of knowing  which takes 
it upon itself to deal with the reality of Spirit isjust the refleccid
tion of Spirit out of its sensuous  existence  back into itself  and 
a  particular  physical  existence  is  for  Spirit  something  incid
different and contingent this kind of knowing must be directly 
aware  that  the  laws  it  has  discovered  tell  us  nothing  that 
strictly speaking it is idle chatter or merely the voicing of ones 
own opinion an expression which contains the truth about itself 
viz  that it is Ones own  opinion that is  putforwarcl  hence not

a  doubt  every  honest  fellow  to  the  end  of time  when  thus 
addressed will retort with a  box on the ear  This retort is  to 
the point because it refutes  the primary assumption  of such a 
science  of mere subjective  opinion  viz  that  the  reality of a 
man is  his face  etc  The true  heing of a  man is  rather his deed 
in this the individual is actual and it is the deed that does away 
with both aspects of what is  merely  meant to be in the one 
aspect where whatis meant has the form ofa corporeal passive

being  the  individuaHty  in  the  deed  exhibits  itself rather  as 
the negative essence which only is in so far as it supersedes  mere 
being Then too the deed equally does away with the inexprescid
sibility ofwhat is meant in respect of the selfconscious indivi  
duality In such mere opinion the individuality is  infinitely decid
termined  and  determinable  In  the  accomplished  deed  this 
spurious infinity is destroyed The deed is  something simply decid
termined  universal  to  be  grasped  in  an  abstraction  it  is 
murder theft  or a good action a  brave deed  and so  on  and 
what it is can be said of it  It is  this  and its  being is  not merely 
a sign  but the fact itself  It is  this  and  the individual human 
being is what the deed is In the simplicity of this heing  the indivicid
dual is for others a universal being who really is and who ceases 
to  be something only meane It is  true  that in  the  deed  he 
is  not explicitly present as  Spirit  but when it is  a  question of 
his  being qua  heing  and  on  the  one  hand  the  twofold  being 
of bodily shape and  deed  are  contrasted  each  purporting  to 
be what he actually is  then it is the deed  alone  that must  be 
affirmed as his genuine beingno t his face or outward appearance 
which is supposed to express what he means by his deeds  or 
what anyone might suppose he merely could do Similarly  on 
the other hand when his performance  and  his  inner possihility 
ca pacity orin tention are contrasted it istheformeralone which 
is to be regarded as his true actuality even ifhe deceives himself 
on the point  and  turning away from  his  action into himself 
fancies that in this inner selfhe is  something else than what he 
is in thedeed Individuality when it commits itself to the objeccid
tive  element in  putting itself into  a  deed  does  of course  risk 
being altered and perverted But what settles  the character of 
the deed  is just this  whether the deed is  an actual  being  that 
endures  or whether it is  merely  a  fancied  performance  that 
in itself is nothing at all  and passes away The analysis  of this 
being into intentions and  subtleties of that sort  whereby  the 
actual man ie his deed is to be explained away again in terms 
of a  being  that is  only  meant just as  the  individual  himself 
even  may crete for  himself special  intentions  concerning  his 
actuality aUthis must be left to the laziness of mere conjecture

with the aim of denying the doer the character of Reason  and 
so illusing him as to declare that not his deed but his face and 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
lineaments are his real being then it may expect to get the retort 
spoken of above  a  retort which demonstrates  that the face  or 
outward appearance is  not the individuals initselfbut on the 
contrary  can  be  an object for  handling 

  Ifwe look now at the range of relationships as  a whole 
in  which  the  self  conscious  individuality  can  be  observed  to 
stand towards its outer aspect  there will be one left which has 
still  to  be  made an object for  observation  In psychology it is 
the external  reality  of things  which  is  supposed  to  have  its  selfcid
conscious  counterpart  in Spirit  and  to  make  Spirit  intelligible 
In physiognomy  on the other hand  Spirit is  supposed  to  be 
kown in its own outer aspect as in a  being which is  the utterance 
of Spiritthe visible  invisibility of its essence  There remains 
the further determination of the aspect of reality viz  that the 
individuality expresses its essence in its immediate firmlyestabcid
lished and purely existent actuality  This last relation is  thus 
distinguished from the physiognomic by the fact that this is  the 
speaking  presence of the individual who  in  expressing  himself 
in action  at the same time exhibits himself as  inwardly reflecting 
and contemplating  himself  an expression which is itself a  movecid
ment  features  in  repose  which  are  themselves  essentially  a 
mediated  being  In  the  determination  yet  to  be  considered 
however  the  outer  aspect  is  lastly  a  wholly  immobile  reality 
which is not in its oWl  self a speaking sign but separated from 
selfconscious movement presents itself  its own account and 
i a  mere Thing 

 

  In the first place in regard to the relation of the inner 
to this its outer it seems clear that that relation must he grasped 
as  a causal connection  since  the  relation of one  beinginitself to 
another beinginitself qua  a necessary relation is a  causal  concid
nection 

 Now for spiritual individuality to have an effect on the 

body it must  qua cause  be itself corporeal The corporeal elecid
ment however in which it acts as  cause  is  the organ  but the 
organ not of action against external reality  but of the internal 
action  of  the  selfconscious  being  operating  outwards  only 
against its own body It is  not at once clear which organs these 
can be Ifwe were thinking only of organs in general the organ 
for  work  as  such  would be quite obvious  similarly  the  organ 
of sex  and  so  on  Organs  of that  sort  however  are  to  be 

 

C  AA  REASON 

considered as instruments or parts which Spirit as one extreme 
possesses as a middle term against the other extreme which is the 
external object  Here however is  to  be understood an organ in 
which  the  selfconscious  individual  as  an  extreme  preserves 
himselfJor himself against his  own  corporeal  actuality which 
is  opposed  to  him  the individual  at the  same  time  not  being 
turned  to  the  outer  world  but  reflected  in  his  action  and  in 
which is  an  organ in which  the  aspect  of being  is  not  a  being
Joranother  It is true that in the physiognomic relation the organ 
is also considered as an existence reflected into itsefand reviewcid
ing  the  action  but  this  being  is  an  objective  being  and  the 
result  of the  physiognomic  observation  is  this  that  selfconcid
sciousness confronts this its  actuality as  something  to  which it 
is indifferent This indifference vanishes in the fact that this very 
reflectednessintoself is  productive  of an  effect  thereby  that 
objective existence receives a necessary relation to it But to act 
on  that existence  the reflectedness  intoself must  itself have  a 
being though  not  strictly  speaking  an  objective  beingand 
as  such an organ it must he pointed  out 

  Now  in  ordinary life  anger  eg  as  such an internal 

action is located in the liver Platoeven assigns the liver somecid
thing still  higher something which is  even  regarded  by some 
as the highest function  of all  viz  prophesying  or  the  gift  of 
speaking of holy and eternal things in a  nonrational  manner 
But the movement which the individual has in his  liver heart 
and so  on  cannot  be  regarded as  wholly  reflected  into  itself 
ratherit is  present in such a  manner that it has already  taken 
ona corporeal aspect in him and has an animal existence turncid
ing outwards to  external  reality 

  The nervous system on the other hand is  the immediate 
repose of the organism in its movement  The nerves  themselves 
it is  true  are again  the organs of that  consciousness  which  is 
already immersed  in its  outwarddirected activity  brain  and 
spinal cord however may be considered as the immediate precid
senceofself  consciousness apresence which abides within itself 
is  not objective and  also  does  not look  outwards  In  so  far  as 
the moment of being which this organ has is  a beingoranother 
ie  is  an  outer existence  it is  a  dead  thing and  no longer the 
presence of selfconsciousness  This beingwithinitself  however 
  Timaeus     

OBSERVING  REASON 

 

is  by its  very  nature  a  fluid  system  in  which  the  circles  cast 
into it immediately dissolve and in which no lasting distinction 
is expressed Meanwhile as Spirit itselfis not abstractly simple 
but a  system of movements in which it differentiates itself into 
moments  but in this very differentiation remains free  and  as 
Spirit articulates its body into a variety offunctions and allots 
one particular part for only one function so too  the fluid  being 
of its bei ngwithinJelf can be thought of as articulated into parts 
And  it seems  that it must be  thought of in  this  way  because 
the  being  of Spirit  which  in  the  brain  is  reflected  into  itself 
is itself again only a  middle term between Spirits pure essence 
and its  corporeal  articulation  a  middle  term which  therefore 
must partake of the nature of both the corporeal aspect  must 
therefore also be present in the middle term in the form of imme 
diate  being 

  The spiritually organic being has at the same time the 
necessary aspect of an inert  enduring  existence  the former  qua 
the extreme ofbeingforself must step back and have this lat 
teras the other extreme over againstit which is then the object 
on which the spiritually organic being acts as cause If now the 
brain and spinal cord together constitute that corporeal being
forselj of Spirit the skull and vertebra column form  the other 
extreme to it  an extreme which is  separated off viz  the solid 
inert Thing When however anyone thinks of the proper locacid
tion  of Spirits  outer  existence  it is  not  the  back  that  comes 
to  mind but only the head  Therefore in  examining a  way of 
knowing  like  the  one  we  are  now  dealing  with  we  can  be 
satisfied with this reasonDot a  very bad reason in this casecid
in order to  confine  this  existence  to  the skull  Should it occur 
to anyone  to  think of the  back  as  the  location  of Spirit in so 
far  as  by it  too  knowing  and doing are no  doubt sometimes 
partly driven in and partly driven  out  this  would  be  no  proof 
at all  that the spinal cord must be taken as included in the incid
dweJling seat of Spirit because this proves  too much  For one 
may equally recall that there are other popular external ways 
too  for  getting  at  the  activity  of Spirit  in  order  to  stimulate 
or inhibit it  The vertebral Goumn  is  then  rightly  ruled  ut 
if you like  that the skull alone does  not  contain  the  organs  of 
Spirit is as well explained as many another doctrine of philocid
sophy of Nature  For  this  was  previously excluded  from  the 

C  AA  REASON 

 
Notion of this  relation and for this reason  the skull  was  taken 
for the aspect of outer existence or if we are not to  be allowed 
to recall  the  Notion  of the  relation  then  certainly  experience 
teaches  that  as  it is  with  the eye  qua  organ that we  see  so  it 
is  not  with  the  skull  that  we  murder  steal  write  poetry  etc 
That is  the  reason  why  we  must  also  refrain  from  using  the 
expression organ for that significance of the skull which has still 
to be mentioned For although it is commonly said that reasoncid
able men pay attention not to the word but to the thing itself 
yet this does not give us permission to describe a  thing in terms 
inappropriate to it For this is at once incompetence and deceit 
to fancy and to pretend that one merely has not the right word 
and to hide from oneself that really one  has  failed  to get hold 
of the thing itself ie  the Notion If one had  the  Notion  then 
one would also have the right word What has been determined 
here in the first instance is only that just as the brain is  the living 
head  the skull is  the caput  mortuum 

  It is in this dead being  then that the mental processes 
andspeeific functions of the brain would have to display their 
outer reality a reality however which is still in the individual 
himself For the relation of those processes and functions  to the 
skull  which  as  a  dead  being  does  not  have  Spirit  dwelling 
within it there presents itself in the first instance the external 
mechanical  relation  established  above  so  that  the  organs 
properand these  are in  the  brainhere  press  the  skull  out 
around there widen or flatten it  Of in whatever other way one 
cares  to  represent  this  action  on  it  Being  itself a  part  of the 
organism it must indeed  he  credited  as  in  the  case  of every 
bone with a living spontaneous formative activity so that from 
this point of view  it is  rather the  skull  that on its  part presses 
on the brain and fixes its outer boundary and it is  better able 
to do this  being the harder But in that case the same relation 
would  still  obtain  in  the  determination  of  their  reciprocal 
activity for whether the skull is  the determining factor  or the 
factor determined  this  would  produce no alteration  at  all  in 
the causal connection except that the skull would then he made 
the  immediate  organ  of selfconsciousness  because  in  it  qua 
cause  would  be found  the aspect of heingforselJ  But  in  point 
offact since beingForself as an organic spontaneity is equally 
present in both any causal connection  between  them is  rtiled 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 

out This development of the two however would be inwardly 
connected and would be an organic preestablished harmony 
which would leave the two interrelated  aspects free  in  respect 
of each other  each with its  own shape  to  which  the  shape  of 
the other need not correspond and still more so  as regards the 
relation  between  the shape and  the quality just as  the  shape 
of the grape and the taste of the wine are mutually independent 
But since  the determination of beingforself falls  on  the side of 
the brain but that of existence  on  the side  of the skull  there is 
also to be established a causal connection between them within 
the  organic  uniiya  necessary  relation  between  them  as 
external for one another ie  a  relation itself external  through 
which therefore the shape of each would be determined by the 
other 

  However  as  regards  the  determination  in  which  the 
organ of selfconsciousness would  act causally on the opposite 
aspect  all sorts of things  can be said  For what is  in question 
is  the constitution of a  cause which is  considered in regard  to 
its indifferent outer existence  its  shape and  size  a  cause whose 
inner being and beingforselfare to bepreciselyofakind which 
does not conern the immediate or outer existence The Qrganic 
spontaneous formation of the skull is in the first place ipdifferent 
to any mechaniCalinfluence exerted on it and thcrelationship 
of these two relations since the former is  a  relating of itself to 
itself  is  Just  this  very  indefiniteness  and  unboundedness 
Furthermore  even  if the  brain  received  into  itself the  discid
tinctions of Spirit as existential distinctions and were a plurality 
of internal organs each occupying a  different space  it would 
be left undetermined whether a spiritual feature would accordcid
ing as it was originallystronger or weaker  be bound to possess 
in the first  casea more expanded brainorgan or in the latter 
case  a  ore ontracted brainorgan  or  even  the  other  way 
about Buth is contradictory to Nature for the brain to be such 
a  plurality  of internal  organs  for  Nature  gives  the  moments 
of the Notion an existence of their own and therefore puts the 
fluid simplicity of organic life dearly on one side and its articu  
lation and division with its distinctions clearly on the other so 
hat in the way they are to be grasped here  they display themcid
selves as particular anatomical things Similarly with the quescid
tion whether the development of the  brain  would  enlarge  or 

C  AA  REASON 

 
diminish  the  organ  whether  it  would  make  it  coarser  and 
thicker or finer  From  the  fact  that  it  remains  undetermined 
how the cause is constituted it is equally left undetermined how 
the effect is  produced  in  the skul  whether it is  an  enlarging 
or a narrowing and fallingin of the latter When this influence 
is defined as  it were  more imposingly as  a  stimulation  it is 
still undetermined whether this takes place by swelling like the 
effect of a  cantharides plaster or by shrivelling like  the  effect 
of vinegar All views of this kind can be supported by plausible 
grounds for  the organic relation which just as  much  plays  a 
part  accommodates  one  view  as  readily  as  another  and  is 
indifferent to  all  this  cleverness 

 I  However  it is  not the function  of observation  to  seek 
to determine  this  relation  for  in any case  it  is  not  the  brain 
qua a physical part which stands on the one side  but the brain 
qua  the  being  of the selfconscious  individuality  This latter as  a 
lasting character and spontaneous conscious  activity existsfor 
itself and within itself  Over against  this  heingforandwithin  
itself stand  its  actuality  and  its  existenceforanother  The 
beingforandwithinitselfis the essence and the subject which 
has a  being in the brain this beingis subsumed under  the  subject 
and gets its VallJe onlythroygh itsindweUingsignificance But 
the  other  aspect  of selfconscious  individ uality  the  aspect 
of itsouterexitence is  being  jua  inciepeldent and subject  or 
qua  a  thing viz a  bone the atuty and existtnce  oj man is his 
skullbone This i how the relationship and the two sides of this 
relJtion  re  understood  by the consciousness  observing  them 
  Observation has now todeal with thernore determinate 
relatiqn of these  aspects  The skullhone does  have in general 
thesignicance of being the immediate actuality of Spirit But 
the manysided ness of Spirit gives its existence a  corresponding 
variety of meanings  What  we  have  to  obtain  is  the  specific 
meaning  of the  particular  areas  into  which  this  existence  is 
divided and we have tosee how theeareas contain an indicacid
tion of that specific meaning 

  The skull  bone is  not an organ of activity  nor even a 
speaking  movement  We  neither commit thet  murder  etc 
with the skullbone nor does  it in the least  betray such  deeds 
by  a  change  of countenance  so  that  the  skullhone  would 
become  a  speaking  gesture  Nor  has  this  immediate  being  the 

OBSER VING  REASON 

 

value  even  of a  sign  Look  and  gesture  tone  of voice  even  a 
pillar or post erected on a desert island directly proclaim that 
they mean something else than w ha t they simply are a t firs t sight 
They at once profess to be signs since they have in them a pecucid
liarity which points to  something else  by  the fact  that it does 
not properly belong to them A variety of ideas may well occur 
to  us  in  connection  with  a  skull  like  those  of Hamlet  over 
Yoricks skull  but the  skullbone just by  itself is  such  an incid
different natural thing  that nothing else is  to  be  directly seen 
in it  or fancied  about it  than simply  the  bone  itself  It does 
indeed  remind  us  of the  brain and  its  specific  nature  and  of 
skulls of a different formation but not of a conscious movement 
since there is  impressed on it neither a  look  nor a  gesture  nor 
anything that proclaims itself to  have  come  from  a  conscious 
action for it is an actuality whose role it is  to  exhibit another 
sort of aspect  of the individuality  one  that  would  no  longer 
be  a  selfreflected  but a  purely immediate  being 

  Further  while  the  skullbone  does  not  itself feel  it 
seems  that perhaps a  more  specific  significance  could  still  be 
fOlndJor it in the fact thtspecificfeelings through their proxcid
imity to  the skull  might enable  us  to  ascertain what it is  that 
the skull meansto convey and when a conscious modeofSpirit 
has  its feeling in a  specific  area of the skull  the  shape  of this 
part of the skulLmight perhapsindicate what thatmode is and 
what is  its pecial  nature  Just as  eg  some  people complain 
of feeling a painful tension  somewhere in  the head  when  they 
are  thinking hard or even  when  thinking at alL  so  too  could 
stealing  committing murder  writing poetry  and  so  on  each 
be accompanied byits own feeling which besides would  necescid
sarilybelocalized in its own special pJace This area of the brain 
which would in this  way be more moved and activated  would 
probably also  develop  the adjacent area of the skull  bone  or 
again this particular area would from sympathy or consensus 
not be inert but would  enlarge or diminish itself or modify its 
shape in some way or other What however  makes this  hypo  
thesis improbahle is  this  that feeling  as  such is  something incid
determinate and feeling in the head as  tJe  centre  might  be  a 
general sympathetic feeling  accompanying all  forms  of suffercid
ing so that mixed up with the thiefs murderers poets headcid
itching or headache are other feelings  which could  as  little be 

 

C  AA  REASON 

distinguished from one another and also from those we can call 
merely bodily feelings  as  an illness can be diagnosed from the 
symptom  of headache if we  restrict  its  significance  merely to 
the  bodily aspect 

  In fact from whatever side we look at the matter there 
is no necessary reciprocal relation at all between them nor any 
direct indication of such a relation If all the same the relation 
is  still  to  exist  what remains  and is  necessary  to form  it is  an 
irrational  free  preestablished  harmony of the  corresponding 
determination of the two aspects for one of the two  aspects is 
to be a  nonspiritual reality  a  mere  thingOn the one side 
then  we  have a  multitude  of inert areas  of the  skull  on  the 
other  a  multitude of mental  properties  whose  number  and 
character will  deperid  on  the state  of psychology  The  more 
paltry the conception of Spirit the easier becomes the task from 
this side for partly  the  mental  properties become fewer  and 
partly  they  become  more  detached  rigid  and  ossified  and 
therefore  more akin  to  characteristics  of the  bone  and  more 
comparable with them  But although the  task is  made much 
easier by the pal try conception of Spirit yet there still remains 
a  very great deal  to  be  done on  both sides  there remains for 
observation the entire conti ngencyof their relation If the childcid
ren of Israel who were  likened in numher to  the sands  of the 
sea  shore  should  each  take  unto  himself  the  grain  of sand 
which stood for him the indifference and arbitrariness of such 
a procedure would be no more glaring than that which assigns 
to  every  faculty  of soul  to  every  passion  andwhat  must 
equally be considered hereto each nuance of character which 
the more refined psychology and knowledge of human nature 
likes to talk about its particular area of skull and shape of skullcid
bone  The  skull  of a  murderer  hasnot  this  organ  or  even 
signbut this bump But this murderer has as well a multitude 
of other properties just as he has other bumps and along with 
the bumps also hollows one has a choice of bumps and hollows 
And  again  his  murderous  disposition  can  be  related  to  any 
bump or hollow and this in turn to any mental property for 
the murderer is neither merely this abstraction of a  murderer 
nor does he have only one bump and one hollow The observacid
tions indulged in on this point mustjust for that reason  sound 
as  sensible  as  those  of the  dealer  and  of the  housewife  about 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
rain at the annual fair and on washday  Dealer and housewife 
might as well make the observation that it always  rains  when 
a  particular neighbour goes  by  or when  they eat  roast  pork 
Just  as  rain  is  indifferent  to  circumstances  like  these  so  too 
from the standpoint of observation a particular determinateness 
of Spirit is  indifferent to a particular formation of the skull  For 
of the two objects of this observation one is a dry sapless beingcid
foritself  an ossified  property of Spirit  the other is  an equally 
sapless beinginitself  such an ossified  thing as  both are is  comcid
pletely indifferent to everything else  It isjust as much a matter 
of indifference to the high bump whether a  murderer is  in its 
vicinity as it is to the murderer whether flatness is  cloe by him 
  It is  of course undeniable that there remains  the possicid
bility that a  bump at some  place or other is  connected  with a 
particular property passion etc One can imagine  the murderer 
with a  high bump here at this place on the skull  and the thief 
with one there From this aspect phrenology is  capabie of still 
greater expansion  for  in the first  instance it seems  to  confine 
itself to connecting a  bump with a  property in the same  indivicid
dual  that is  the individual possesses both But natural or everycid
day phrenologyfor there must  be  such  a  science  as  well  as 
a natural physiognomyalready goes  beyond  this  restriction 
It not only declares  that a  cheating fellow  has  a  bump as  big 
as your fist  behind his ear but also asserts that not the unfaithcid
ful  wife  herself  but the  other cotiugal party  has  a  bump  on 
the forehead  Similarly one can imagine  the man who is  living 
under the same  roof as  the murderer  or  even  his  neighbour 
Of  going further  afield  imagine  his  fellowcitizens  et  with 
high  bumps on some part or other of the skull just as  well  as 
one  can imagine  the flyi ng cow  that first  was  caressed  by  the 
crab  that was  riding on the donkey etc  etc  But if possibility 
is  taken not in  the sense  of the  possibility  of imagining  but in 
the sense of inner possibility or the possibility of the Notion  then 
the object is  a  reality of the kind  which is  a  pure  thing  and 
is  and  should  be  without a  significance  of this  sort  and  can 
therefore have it only in imagination or picturethinking 

  The observer  ignoring  the mutual indifference of the 
two aspects  may  nevertheless  set  to  work  to  determine  their 
relations partly encouraged  by  the general rational principle 
that the outer is  the expression  of the  inner  and  partly supported 

 

C  AA  REASON 

by the analogy of the skulls ofanimalswhich indeed may well 
have a  simpler character than human beings  but of which at 
the same  time it will  be all  the  harder to  say  what character 
they do have since it cannot be easy for anyone really to enter 
in imagination into the nature of an animal  Should however 
the observer do so  he will  find  in assuring  us  of the  certainty 
of the laws  he  claims  to  have  discovered  an  excellent  aid  in  a 
distinction  which  must  necessarily  occur  to  us  here  too  The 
being  of Spirit cannot in  any case  be  taken  as  something fixed 
and  immovable  Man  is  free  it  is  admitted  that  the  original 
being consists merely of dispositions  about which a  man is  free 
to do much as  he wishes  or which require favourable  circumcid
stances for their development ie  an original being of Spirit is 
equally well  to be spoken of as  a  being  that does  not exist  qua 
being  Were observations therefore to conflict with what somecid
one happens to maintain is  a  law  should  it  happen  to  be fine 
weather at  the annual  fair  or on  washclaythen  dealer and 
housewife might say that really it ought to rain  and that the tencid
dency to rain is certainly present  So too when observing the skull 
it  might  he  said  that  this  individual  really  ought  to  be  what 
according  to  the  law  his  skull  proclams  him  to  be  and  that 
he  has  an  original  disposition  but  one  that  has  not  been  decid
veloped this quality is  not present  hut it ought to  be present  The 
law and the ought are based on ohservationofactual rainfall 
and  on  the  actual  significance  in  the  case  of this  particular 
characteristic feature of the skull but if the reality is not present 
the empty possibility serves eq uall y weJ  This possi bili ty i e  noncid
actuality of the stated law nd hence the observations conflictcid
ing with the law inevitably result from the fact that the freedom 
of the  individual  and  the  developing  circumstance are  incid
different to being as  such or to  what merely is  indifferent  to 
being  both as  an original inner and as  an outer osseous  form 
and this also from the fact that the individual can be something 
else  than he  is  by inner disposition  and  still  more  than  what 
he  is  as  a  bone 

  We get then the possibility that this bump or this hollow 
on  the  skull  may denote  something  actual  as  well  as  merely 
a disposition  one  moreover  that is  so illdefined  as  to  denote 
something that is  not  actual  we  see  what happens  as  always 
to a bad subterfuge viz that it is itselfready to  be used against 

OBSERVING  REASON 

 
what it is supposed to support We see mere subjective imaging 
ing brought by the very nature of the fact  to saybut unthinkcid
inglythe opposite of what it affirms to say that by this particucid
lar bone something or other is  indicated but equally too is  not 
indicated 

  What such imagining vaguely has in mind in  the case 
of this subterfuge is  the true  thought which in fact  abolishes 
that imagining viz  that being as such is  not the truth of Spirit 
at all Just as  the disposition is itself an original being  which has 
no part in the activity of Spirit just such a  being is  the  bone 
on its  side  What merely is  without  any  spiritual  activity  is 
for consciousness  a  Thing  and far from  being the  essence  of 
consciousness is  rather its opposite and consciousness is  only 
actual  to  itself through  the  negation  and  abolition  of such  a 
being From this point of view it must be regarded as a complete 
denial of Reason to pass off a bone as  the actual existence of concid
sciousness  and  it is  passed  off as  such  when it is  regarded  as 
the outer being of Spirit for the outer isjust that reality which 
merely is I tis nonse sa yingthat the inner is only being inferred 
from  the  outer and is  something  different  nor  that  the  outer  is 
notthe inner itself  but only its  expression  For in  the  relation 
of the two to one another the determination of the reality that 
thinks  itself  and is  in the form  of thought  does  fall  on the side 
of the inner  but on the side of the outer falls the determination 
of the  reality which merely  is  When  therefore  a  man is  told 
You  your inner being  are this kind  of person  because your 
skullbone is  constituted in such and such a  way  this  means 
nothing else  than I regard a  bone as your  reality  To reply  to 
such  a judgement with  a  box  on  the  ear  as  in  the  case  of a 
similar judgement in  physiognomy  mentioned  above  at first 
takes  away from  the soft parts their importance and position 
and proves only that these are no true in  itself are notthe reality 
of Spirit  the  retort here  would  strictly speaking  have  to  go

  The crude instinct of selfconscious  Reason  will  reject 

out of hand such a  science of phrenologythis  other obsercid
vational  instinct  of  selfconscious  Reason  which  having 

 

C  AA  REASON 

attained  to  a  glimpse  of the  cognitive  process  has  grasped  it 
unintelligently in a way that takes the outer to be the expression 
of the inner But the worse  the  conception  the less  sometimes 
does  it occur to one wherein  its  badness  specifically  lies  and 
the harder it is to analyse it For a conception is said to be worse 
the purer and emptier the abstraction which is  takcn  to  be  its 
essence  But the antithesis we are here  concerned  with  has for 
its  sides  the  individuality  that  is  conscious  of itself  and  the 
abstraction of externality  that  has  become  wholly  a  Thingcid
that inner being of Spirit grasped as a fixed  nonspiritual being 
opposed tojust such a being But Reason in its role of observer 
having reached  thus far  seems  also  to  have reached its  peak 
at which point it must abandon itself and do a rightabout turn 
for only what is wholly bad is implicitly charged with the immecid
diate necessity  of changing round  into its opposite  Just so  it 
may  be said  of the  Jewish  people  that it is  precisely  because 
they stand before the portal of salvation that they are and have 
been the most reprobate and rejected what that people should 
be in and for itself  this  essen tial nature of its  own self  is  not 
explicitly present to it on the co ntra ry it places it heyond itself 
By this alienation it creates for itself the possibility  of a  higher 
existence if only i t could take backagain into itself its alienated 
object than ifit had remained  undisturbed within  the  immecid
diacy of beingbecause Spirit is aU  the greater thegreater the 
opposition from which it has returned into itself  but it creates 
this  opposition for  itself by  setting  aside  its  immediate  unity 
and  by alienating  its  beingfor  self  However  if such  a  concid
sciousness does  not reflect on itself  the intermtdiate position 
or middle term  which  it occupies  is  an  unhappy  void  since 
what  should  fill  and  fulfiJ  it  has  been  turned  into  a  fixed 
extreme Thus it is  that this final  stage of Reason in  its obsercid
vational role is  its  worst and  that is  why its  reversal  becomes 
a  necessity 

  For a survey of the series of relations  considered so  far 
which  constitute  the content and object of observation  shows 
that in their first  form  ie  in  the observation  of the relations 
of inorganic Nature sensuous being is alread y lost  to view the 
moments of the  relations  present  themselves  as  pure  abstraccid
tions and as  simple Notions which should be firmly tied  to  the 
existence of things  an  existence  however  which gets  lost  so

that the  moment  demonstrates  itself to  be  a  pure  movement 
and a universaL This free process which is complete within itself 
retains the significance of something objective but now appears 
as a unitary being in the process of the inorganic this unitary 
being is the nonexistent inner but the process existing as  a unicid
tary being is the organism The unitary being  qua  a  beingforcid
self or  negative  being  stands  in  antithesis  to  the  universal 
draws  away  from  it  and  remains  free  for  itself  so  that  the 
Notion being realized only in the element of absolute singleness 
and isolation does not find in organic existence its true exprescid
sion viz  to be present as  a  universal  but remains an outer or 
what is the same thing an inner of organic Nature The organic 
process is  orily implicitly  free  but is  not explicitly  free for  itself 
the beingforself of its freedom  appears in purpose  and  exists  as 
another being as a wisdom thatis conscious ofitselfand is outside 
of the process  Reason in the role of observer thus turns to this 
wisdom turns to Spirit to the Notion existing as a universality 
or to purpose existing  as  purpose  and  henceforth  the  object 
before it is  its  own essence 

  It turns its attention at first to its purity ie its abstract 
form  but since  Reason qua  observer  apprehends  the  object 
which moves among its own distinct moments as an inert being 
its  Laws  of  Thought  become  connections  of  one  constant 
moment to another constant moment But the content of these 
la ws being only moments these run together in to the single uni t 
of selfconsciousness This new object similarly taken as an inert 
being  is  the  single  contingent  selfconsciousness  Observation 
stands  therefore  within  what  it  imagines  to  be  Spirit  and 
within the contingent relation of conscious  reality  to a  reality 
that is not conscious Spirit alone is in its own self the necessity 
of this relation Observation therefore looks more closely atthis 
object  and  compares its  reality which wills  and  acts  with  its 
reality which ponders and is reflected into itself a reality which 
is itself objective This outer aspect although a language of the 
individual  which  he  possesses  within  himself  is  at  the  same 
time  qua  sign  something indifferent  to  the  content it is  supcid
posed  to  denote just as  that which  posits  for  itself the  sign  is 
indifferent to it 

  For  this  reason  observation  finally  goes  back  again 
from  this  inconstant language  to  the fixed  being  and  declares 

C  AA  REASON 

 
in accordance with its Notion that externality is  the outer and 
immediate reality of Spirit not as an organ and not as  a  lancid
guage  or a  sign  but as  a  dead  Thing  What was  ruled  out  by 
the very first observation ofinorganic Nature viz  the idea that 
the Notion ought to  be present in the form of a  Thing is  reincid
stated by this last form of observation in such a way that it turns 
the reality of Spirit itselfinto a Thing or expressing it the other 
way  round  gives  to  lifeless  being  the  significance  of Spirit 
Observation  has  here  reached  the  point  where  it  openly  decid
clares what our Notion of it was viz that the certainty of Reason 
seeks its own selfas an objective reality Of course the intention 
here is  not to state that Spirit which is  represented  by a  skull 
is  a  Thing  there is  not meant  to  be  any materialism  as  it  is 
called in this idea rather Spirit must be something more and 
other than these bones But to say that Spirit merely is means 
nothing  else  than  that it is  a  Thing  When  being  as  such  or 
thinghood  is  predicated of Spirit  the  true  expression  of this 
is  that Spirit is  therefore  the same kind  of being  that  a  bone 
is  It must  therefore  be regarded  as  extremely important that 
the true expression has been found for the hare statement about 
Spiritthat it is  When in other respects it is  said of Spirit that 
it is  that it has  being  is  a  Thing  a single separate  reality  this 
is  not intended to mean  that it is  something we can see  or take 
in our hands or touch  and so on  but that is  what is  said  and 
what really  is said is  expressed by saying that the  being  of Spirit 
is  a bone 

  Now  this  result  has  a  twofold  significance  One is  its 
true meaning in so far as it is  a  completion of the outcome of 
the preceding movement of selfconsciousness  The  Unhappy 
Selfconsciousness renounced its independence and struggled to 
make its beingforself into a  Thing  It thereby reverted from self 
consciousness to consciousness ie to theconsciousness for which 
the object is something which merely is a Thing but here what 
isa Thiog is selfconsciousness the Thing is therefore the unity 
of the I and beingthe category  The object being determined 
thcls  for  consciousness  the  latter possesses  Reason  Consciouscid
ness  as  well  as  selfconsciousness  is  in  itself Reason  but only 
that  consciousness  for  which  the  object  is  determined  as  the 
category can  be said  to  have  Reason  From  this  however  we 
must still  distinguish  the  knowledge  of what  Reason  is  The 

OBSERVING  REASON 

category  which is  the immediate  unity  of being  and  seljl  must 
pass  through  both forms  and  it  is  precisely  for  consciousness 
qua observer that the category presents itselfin the form of being 
This consciousness in its result enunciates as a proposition that 
of which it is  the  unconscious  certaintythe proposition that 
is implicit in the Notion of Reason This proposition is the infinite 
judgement  that  the  self is  a  Thing  a judgement  that suspends 
itself  Through this  result  then  the category is  further deter  
mined  as  being this  selfsuperseding antithesis  The pure  cate 
gory  which is  present for consciousness in the form  of being  or 
immediacy  is  the object as  still unmediated  as  merely given  and 
consciousness  is  equally unmediated in  its  relation  to  it  The 
moment of that infinite judgemen t is the transition of immediacy 
into mediation or negativity  The given object is  consequently 
determined as a negative object consciousness however is  de 
termined as Jeif  consciousness  over against it in other words 
the  category  which  in  the  course  of  observation  has  run 
through the form  of being is  now posited  in the form  of being 
forself  consciousness  no longer  aims  to find  itself immediately 
but to produce itself by its  own  activity  It is  itself the  End at 
which its action aims whereas in its role of observer it wasconcid
cernedonly with things 

  The other significance  of the  result is  the  one already 
considered  viz  the  significance  of an  observational  activity 
that  dispenses  with  the  Notion  This  knows  no  other  way of 
understanding and expressing itself than naively asserting  the 
reality  of selfconsciousness to lie in the  bone just as  it exists as 
a sensuous  thing and which at the same time does  not lose  its 
objectivity for consciousness I t has no clear consciousness howcid
ever of what is implied in its assertion  and does not grasp the 
specific character of the subject and predicate  and  their relacid
tion in its proposition still less in the sense of the ipfinite  self 
suspendingjudgementand of the NQtion Rather out ofapro 
founder  selfconsciousness of Spirit  which  here  appears  as  a 
natural Jonesty it conceals from itself the disgracefulness of the 
irrational crude thought which takes a  bone for  the reality of 
sdfconsciousness andit whitewashes that thought by unthink 
ingly mixing up with it all  sorts  of relationships  of cause  and 
effect  of sign  organ  etc  which  arc  meaningless  here  and

it hides  the  crudity of the proposition  by  distinctions  derived 
from  them 

 

  Brain fibres  and  the like  when  regarded  as  the  being 
of Spirit are no more than a merely hypothetical reality exist 
ing only in ones head  not the  true reality which  has  an outer 
existence and which can be felt and seen when  they exist  out 
there  when  they are seen  they are dead objects  and  then  no 
longer pass for  the being of Spirit But objectivity proper must 
be an immediate  sensuous objectivity so that in this dead  objec 
tivityfor the bone is  a  dead  thing  so  far  as  what is  dead  is 
present in the living being itselfSpirit is explicitly present as 
actual  The Not jon  underlying this idea is  that  Reason  takes 
itself to be all thinghood even purely ohjective thinghood itself but 
it is  this  only in  the  Notion  or only  the Notion  is  the  truth of 
this idea and the purer the Notion itself is  the sillier an idea 
it becomes when its content is  in  the form  not of the  Notion 
but of picturethinking ie if the selfsuspending judgement is 
not taken with  the  consciousness  of this  its  infinitude  but as 
a fixed proposition the subject and predicate of which are valid 
each on its  own  account  the self fixed  as  self  the thing  fixed 
as thing and yet each is supposed tobe the other Reason essen 
tially the Notion is directly sundered into itselfand its opposite 
anantithesis which for that very reason is equally immediately 
resolved But when Reason is  presented  as  its  own self and  its 
QPposite  and  is  held  fast  in  the  entirely separate  moment of 
this asunderness itis apprehended irrationally and the purer 
the moments of this asunderness  the cruder is  the appearance 
of this  content which is  either only  for  consciousness  or only 
ingenuously expressed by it The depth which Spirit brings forth 
from  withinbut only as far as  its picture  thinking conscious 
ness where it lets it remainand the ignorance of this conscious 
ness about what it really is  saying are the same conjunction of 
the high and the low which in the living being Nature naively 
expresses when it combines the organ of its  highest fulfilment 
the organ of generation  with  the organ of urination  The in 
finite  judgement  qua  infinite  would  be  the  fulfilmet of life 
that comprehends itself the consciousness of the infinite judge

B  THE  ACTUALIZATION  OF  RATIONAL  SELFcid
CONSCIOUSNESS  THROUGH  ITS  OWN  ACTIVITY 

  Selfconsciousness found the Thing to be like itself and 
itself to  be like  a  Thing ie  it is  aware  that  it  is  in  itself the 
objectively real  world  It is  no  longer  the  immediate  certainty 
of being all  reality  but  a  certainty  for  which  the  immediate 
in  general has  the form  of something superseded  so  that  the 
objectivity of the immediate still has only the value of something 
superficial its inner being and essence being selfconsciousness 
itself  The object to  which it is  positively related  is  therefore 
a selfconsciousness  It is in the form of thing hood ie  it is  indecid
pendent  but it is  certain  that  this  independent object  is  for  it 
not something alien and thus it knows that it is in principle recogcid
nized by the object  It is  Spirit which in  the duplication of its 
self  consciousness and in the independence of both has the cercid
tainty of its unity with itself This certainty has now to be raised 
to  the level of tru th w ha t holds good  for  it in  principle  and in 
its  inner  certainty  has  to  enter  into  its  consciousness  and 
become explicit for  it 

  What the general stages of this actualization  will  be  is 
readily apparent in a  general way frOlU  a comparison with the 
path hitherto followed  Just as  Reason  in the role of observer 
repeated in the element of the category the movement of concid
sciousness viz sensecertainty perception and the Understandcid
ing so  will  Reason  again run through  the  double  movement 
of selfconsciousness  and pass over from independence into its 
freedom  To begin with  this  active  Reason  is  aware  of itself 
merely as an individual and as such must demand and produce 
its reality inan other Then however its consciousness having 
raised itself into universality it becomes  universal  Reason  and 
is conscious of its elf as  Reason as a consciousness that is  already 
recognized  in  and  for  itself  which  in  its  pure  consciousness 
unites  all selfconsciousness  It is  the  simple  spiritual  essence 
which in attaining consciousness is at the same time  real  Subcid

so  that in comparison with the latter they are merely particu 
lar moments of its  Becoming moments which do indeed break 
loose and appear as independent forms  but in  fact have existcid
ence and reality only as grounded in that Becoming and possess 
their  truth  only in so  far  as  they are  and  remain  in  it 

  If we  take  this  goaland  this  is  the  Notion  which for 
us  has  already appeared  on  the  scenein its  reality  viz  the 
selfconsciousness  that  is  recognized  and  acknowledged  and 
which has its own selfcertainty in the other free selfconsciouscid
ness  and  possesses  its  truth  precisely  in  that  other  in  other 
words if we look on this still inner Spirit as Substance that has 
already advanced to the stage of having an outer existence then 
in  this  Notion there is  disclosed  the realm of ethical life  For this 
is  nothing else  than  the  absolute spiritual  unity  of the  essence 
of individuals in  their independent actual  existence  it is  an  incid
trinsically  universal  selfconsciousness  that  takes  itself  to  be 
actual in another consciousness in such wise that this  has comcid
plete independence or is  looked on as  a  Thing and it is  precid
cisely  therein  that  the  universal selfconsciousness  is  aware  of 
its unity with it and only in  this  unity with this objective being 
is  it  selfconsciousness  This  ethical  Substance 
taken  in  its 
abstract universality is  ony law in  the form of thought but it 
is no less immediately actual selfconsciousness or it is custom  The 
single individual consciousness conversely is  only this existent 
unit in so  far  as  it  is  aware  of the  universal  consciousness  in 
its  individuality as  its  own  being since what it  does  and  is  is 
the  universal  custom

present here as  the fluid  universal  Substance  as  unchangeable 
simple  thinghood  which  yet  bursts  asunder into  many comcid

stars as  countless selfuminous points which in  their absolute

the sacrifice of their particularity and by having this  universal 
Substance as  their soul and essence just as this universal again 
is  their own doing as particular individuals or is  the work that 
they have produced 

 I  the purely  particular activity  and  occupation  of the 
individual refers to the needs which he has as a natural creature 
ie as a merely immediate individuality That even these its comcid
monest functions are not frustrated  but enjoy an actual existcid
ence  is  due  to  the  universal sustaining  medium  to  the  might 
of the entire nation But in the universal Substance the indivicid
dual has thisJorm of subsistence not only for his activity as such 
but no less also for  the content  of that activity what he  does  is 
the skill and customary practice of all  This content  in so  far 
as it is completely particularized is in its actual existence con  
fined  within the framework of the activity of all  The labour of 
the individual for  his  own  needs is just as  much a  satisfaction 
of the needs of others as of his  own  and  the satisfaction of his 
own needs he obtains only through the labour of others  As  the 
individual in his  individual work already unconsciusly performs 
a universal work  so  again he also  performs  the universal  work 
as  his conscious object the whole becomes as  a whole  his  own 
work for  which he sacrifices himself and precisely in so  doing 
receives back from it his  own self  There is  nothing here which 
would not be reciprocal nothingin relation to which the indecid
pendence of the individual would  not  in  the dissolution  of its 
beingforselfin the negation of itself give itself its positive signifi  
canceofbeingJor itself This unity ofbeing  foranother or makcid
ing oneself a  Thing  and  of beingforaself  this  universal  Subcid
stance  speaks  its  universal  language  in the  customs and laws  of 
its nation But this existent unchangeable essence is  the exprescid
sion  of the very individuality which  seems  opposed  to  it the 
laws proclaim what each individual is and does the individual 
knows them not only as  his universal objective thinghood  but 
equally knows  himselfin them or knows them as  particularized 
in his own individuality and in each of his fellow  citizens  In 
the universal  Spirit  therefore  each  has  only  the  certainty  of 
himself of finding in the actual world  nothing but himself  he 
is  as  certain of the others as  he is  of himself  I  perceive in  all 
of them  the fact  that  they  know  themselves  to  be  only  these 
independent  beings just as  I  am  I  perceive in  them  the  free

unity  with  others  in  such  wise  that  just  as  this  unity  exists 
through me so it exists through the others tooI regard them 
as  myself and  myself as  them 

  In a  free  nation therefore  Reason is  in truth realized 
I t is  a  present  living  Spirit  in  which  the  individual  not only 
finds  his  essential  character  ie  his  universal  and  particular 
nature expressed and present to him in the form of thing hood 
but is  himself this  essence  and  also  has  realized  that essential 
character The wisest men of antiquity have therefore declared 
that wisdom and virtue consist in living in accordance with the 
customs of ones nation 

  But from this happy state of having realized its essential 
character and  of living in it  selfconsciousness  which  at first 
is Spirit only immediately and in principle has withdrawn or else 
has  not yet  realized  it for  both may equally well  be said 

  Reason must  withdraw  from  this  happy state for  the 
life of a free people is only in principle or immediately the reality 
of an  ethical  order  In  other  words  the  ethical  order  exists 
merely as something given  therefore this  universal Spirit itself 
is a separate individualspirit and the customs and laws intheir 
entirety area specific ethical substance which only in the higher 
stage viz in Spirits consciousness of its essencesheds this limicid
tation and  in  this  knowledge alone has  its  absolute  truth  not 
directly asi t immediately is In the latter form it is a limited ethical 
substance and absolute limitation is just this  that Spirit is  in 
the form  of mere  being 

  Further therefore  the single  individual consciousness 
as it exists immediately in the real ethical order or in the nation 
is a solid unshaken trust in which Spirit has not for the indivicid
dual resolved itself into its abstract  moments and  therefore  he 
is not aware of himself as heing a pure individuality on his  own 
account But once he has arrived at this idea as he must  then 
this  immediate  unity with  Spiri t  the   mere  being  of hiJlself in

is now the essence no longer universal Spirit This individuality

itself but only as a  vanishing quantity which appearing on its

These  are regarded as  mere ideas having no absolute  essenticid

particular I is  his  own  living  truth 
  Or selfconsciousness has not yet attained this happy state 
ofbeing the ethical substance the Spirit of a people For having 
turned back from its role of observer Spirit at first  is  not yet 
as such realized through itself it is  established only as  an inner 
essence or as  an abstraction  In other words  Spirit is  at first 
immediate  but existing immediately  it is  separate and  indivicid
dual It is  the practical consciousness which steps into its world 
which it finds  already given  with  the  aim  of duplicating itself 
in  this  distinct form  of something separate and  individual  of 
producing itselfas  this  individual  as  this  existent counterpart 
ofitself and of becoming conscious of this unity of its own actucid
ality with  the objective being of the  world  Selfconsciousness 
has  thecertainty of this  unity it holds that the unity is  implicitly 
already present or that this agreement of itself with thinghood 
already exists and has only to become sojor it through its own 
agency or thatthe production of that unity is equally the findcid
ing of it  Since  this  unity  means  happiness  the  individual is 
sent out into the world by his own spirit to seek his  happiness 
  If thenjor us the truth of this rational selfconsciousness 
is  the ethical substance  here jor that  selfconsciousness  it is  the 
beginning of its  ethicatexperience  of the  world In  so  far  as 
it  has  not  yet  become  the  ethical  substance  this  movement 
presses forward  to it and what is superseded in the movement 
are  the  individual  moments  which  for  selfconsciousness  are 
valid  in  their isolation  They have  the form  of an  immediate 
will or natural impulse which obtains its satisfaction which is itself 
the  content of a  fresh  impulse  If  however  selfconsciousness 
has lost  the happiness of being in the substance  these  natural 
impulses are bound up with an awareness that their goal is  the 
true  character and essential  nature  of selfconsciousness  The 
ethical substance  has  sunk  to  the  level  of a  predicate  devoid 
of self  whose  living subjects  are  individuals  who  themselvs 
have  to  provide  the  filling  for  their  universality  and  to  fulfil 
their essential  nature  through  their own  efforts  Taken in the 
former  sense  then  those  forms  are  the  comingtobe  of the 

C  AA  REASON 

ethical substance and precede it in the latter  they succeed  it 
and reveal toselfconsciousnesswhatits essential nature is  In the 
former case the immediacy or rawness of the impulses gets lost 
in the process of getting to know what their truth is  and  their 
content takes on a  higher form  In the latter case  what is  lost 
is  the false  idea of the  consciousness  which  places  its  essential 
nature in those impulses Inthe former case the goal they attain 
is the ethical Substance while in the latter it is  the conscious 
ness  of that Substance  a  consciousness  which  knows  the  Subcid
stance  to  be  its  own  essence  and  to  that  extent  this  process 
would be the coming in to existence of morali ty of a higher form 
than the ethical Substance But these forms  at the same time 
constitute only one side of moralitys entry into existence that 
namely which belongs to beingforselj  or in which consciouscid
ness sets aside its Endsnot the side where morality arises from 
the  ethical  substance  itself  Since  these  moments  cannot  as 
yet carry the significance of being made into Ends opposed  to 
the stethicaLorder they signify here it is true no more than 
what they immediately are and the goal which  they strive  to 
attain is the ethical Substance but since in our times that form 
of these moments is  morefamiliar in which  they appear after

is  raises  selfconsciousness  to  a  higher level  and from  now on 
it is itselfits own End in so far as it is at the same time universal 
and has  the law directly within it  In carrying out this  law of 
its  heart  however  it  learns  that  the  individual  in  doing  so 
cannot preserve  himself  but rather tht the  good  can only  be 
accomplished through the sacrifice of the individual and selfcid
consciousness  becomes  virtue  What virtue learns  from  expericid
ence can only be this  that its  End is  already attained in princid
ciple  that happiness is  found  directly in the  action itself  and 
that action  itself is  the  good  The  Notion  or principle  of this 
entire sphere viz  that thinghood is  Spirits very heingjoritselj 
becomes in  the  course  of this  experience  a  truth for  selfconcid
sciousness  Having  discovered  this  selfconsciousness  thus 
knows itself to  be reality in the form  of an  individuality  that 
directly  expresses  itseif  an  individuality  which  no  longer 
encounters resistance from  an actual world opposed  to it  and 
whose  aim and object are only this  expressing of itself 

a  Pleasure  and  Necessity 

  Selfconsciousness which onthewhole knowsitselfto be 
reality  has its object in its own self  but as an object which ini  
tially is  merely jor selfconsciousness  and  does  not as yet possess 
objective  being which confronts it as  a  reality other than its 
own  and  selfconsciousness  by  behaving as  a  beihg  forself 
aims to  see  itself as  another independent being  This primary 
End is  to become a ware of itself as  an individual in  the other 
self  consdousness or to  make this other into itself it is certain 
that this  other is  in  principle  already  itself  In  so  far  as  it has 
lifted itself out of the ethical Substance and the tranquil being 
of thought to its beingforselJ it has left behind the law of es
tom and  existence  the knowledge  acquired  through observacid
tion and theory as a grey shadow which is in the actofpassing 
out of sight For the latter is  rather a  knowledge of something 
whose  beingforself and actuality are other than those of this 
selfconsciousness  Instead  of  the  heavenly  seeming  Spirit 
of the universality of knowledge and action in which the feelcid
ing  and  enjoyment  of  individuality  are  stilled  there  has 
entered into it the Spirit of the earth for  which  true actuality 
is merely that being which is  the actuality of the individual concid

cance that selfconsciousness has become objective to  itself  but 
equally  it  has  the  negative  one  of having  reduced  itself to  a 
moment And since it grasped its realization in the former sense 
only its experience is  of a  contradiction in which  the attained 
reality of its individuality sees  itself destroyed  by the negative 
essence  confronting it  which  is  devoid  of reality  and  content 
and  which  yet  is  the power which destroys it  This  essence  is 
nothing else than the Notion  of what this  individuality in itself 
is It is however as yet the poorest form of selfrealizing Spirit 
for it is aware of itself at first only as  the abstraction  of Reason 
or is  the immediacy of the unity of beingforitself and  beingincid
itself its essence is therefore only the abstract category  Nevercid
theless  it no longer  has  the  form  of immediate  simple  being  as 
it has for  Reason in its  observational role  where it is  abstract 
being or  posited  in the for of an alien  being  is  thinghood  in 
general Here in this thinghood there has entered  beingforself 
and  mediation  It therefore  makes  its  appearance  asa circle 
whose content isthe developed pure relation of the simple essencid
tialities The realization attained by this individuality consists 
therefore in nothing more  than  this  viz  that it has  castforth 
this circle ofabtractions from its confinement within simple selfcid
consciQgsness  into  the  element  where  they  are jor  selfconcid
sci oJsness  in other words are expanded into an objective excid
istence The object  then that is for selfconsciousness as it takes 
its pleasure its essnce is the epansion of those empty essentiali 
ties ofpure uni ty of pure difference and their relation beyond 
this the object which the individuality experiences as its essence 
has no content It is  what is  called necessity  for necessity  fate 
and the like isjust that about which we cannot say what it does 
what its specific Jaws and positive content are  because itis the 
absolllte pure Notion itselfiewed as  mere being arelalion that 
is  simple and empty  but also  irresistible  and  imperturbable 
whose work is mereJy the nothingness of individuality It is  this 
fixed relation  because what is  related is  the pure essentialities 
or empty abstractions Unity difference and relation are catecid
gories  each  of which  is  nothing  in  and  for  itself  but only in 
relation to its opposite and they cannot therefore be separated 
from  one  another  They  are  related  to  one  another  through 
their Notion for they are pure Notions themselves and this absocid
lute  relation  and  abstract  movement  constitutes  necessity  The 

 

C  AA  REASON 

merely single individuality which in the first instance has only 
the  pure  Notion  of Reason  for  its  content  instead  of having 
taken  the  plunge  from  dead  Theory  into  Life  has  there 
fore  really only plunged  into  the  consciousness of its  own  ife 
lessness and has as its lot only empty and alien necessity a  dead 
actuality 

  The transition is made from the form  of the one or unit 
into that of universality  from  one  absolute  abstraction into  the 
other from the purpose of pure heingforselfwhich has thrown 
off al  community with others  into  the  sheer  opposite  which 
is  thus  equally abstract heinginitselj  Consequently  the  form 
in which this appears is that the individual has simply perished 
and  the absolute unyieldingness of individual existence is  pulcid
verized on the equally unrelenting but continuous world of accid
tuality  Since it is  as  consciousness  the  unity of itself and  its 
opposite  this downfall is still for it its  goal  and  realization  as 
also  the  contradiction  of what  was for  it  essence  and  what  is 
in  itself essence  It experiences  the double meaning implicit in 
what it did viz when it tookhold of life and possessed  it but 
in doing so it really  laid  hold  of death 

  This transition  of its living being into a lifeless  necessity 
therefore appears to it as an inversion which is not mediated by 
anythingatall The mediating agency would have to be that in 
which both sides would be one where therefore consCiousness 
recognized  onemomeIt in  the  other  its  purpose  and  action 
in fate  and its fate  in  its  purpose and  action  that is  would 
recognize  its  own  essence  in  this  necessity  But  this  unity is  for 
this consciousness just pleasure itself  or the simple single feelcid
ing and the transition from the moment of this its purpose into 
the moment of its true essence is for it a sheer leap into its anticid
thesis For these moments are notcontainedand linked together 
in  feeling  but only  in  the  pure self  which  is  a  universal  or 
thought  Conscimsness  therefore  through  its  experience  in 
whichitshould havefound its truth has really become a riddle 
to itself  the consequences oits deeds  are for it not the deeds 
themselves What befalls it Isr it  not the experience of what 
it is  in itself  the transition is  not a  mere alteration of the form 
of the same content and essence  presented now as  the content 
and essence and again as object or outwardly  beheld essence 
of itself The ahstract necessity  therefore has  the character of the 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

merely  negative  uncomprehended  power  of universality  on 
which individuality is  smashed  to  pieces 

  This is  as  far  as  the  manifestation  of this  form  of self  
consciousness  goes  The  final  moment  of its  existence  is  the 
thought of the loss  of itself in necessity or the thought of itself 
asa being that is aqsolutely alien to it  However self  conscious  
ness has in itselfsurvived this loss for this necessity or pure uni  
versality is  its own essence This reflection of consciousness into 
itself the knowledge that necessity is itself is a new form of concid
sciousness 

b  The  law  oj the  heart  and  the frenzy  oj selfconceit 

  What necessity truly is in selfconsciousness it is for this 
new  form  of selfconsciousness  in which it knowsits  own  self 
to be the principle ofnecessi ty I t knows that it has the universal 
oflaw immediately within itself and because the law is immediately 
present in the beingforself of consciousness it is  called thelaw 
of the  heart  This  form  takes  itself to  be  qua  individuality 
essence  like  the  previous  form  but  the  new  form  is  richer 
because its beingforseif has  for  it  the  character of necessity or 
universali ty 

  The  law  therefore  which  is  immediately  self  concid

sciousnesss own law or a heart which however has  within it 
a  law  is  the End  which  selfconsciousness  proceeds  to  realize 
We  have  to  see  whether  its  realization  corresponds  to  this 
Notion and whether in that realization it will find  that this its 
law is its essential  nature 

  This heart is confronted by a rea world for in the heart 
the law is  in  the first  place only  for  its  own self  it is  not yet 
realised and is therefore at the same time something other than 
what  the  Notion  is  This other is  thereby  characterized  as  a 
reality which is  the opposite of what is  to be realized  and concid
sequentlyis the contradiction of the law and the individuality 
This reality is  therefore on the one hand a  law  by which  the 
particular individuality is oppressed a violent ordering of the 
world which contradicts the law of the heart and on the other 
hand  a  humanity suffering  under  that ordering  a  humanity 
that does  not follow  the  law  of the  heart  but is  subjected  to 
an  alien  necessity  It  is  evident  that  this  real  world  which 
appears  over  against  the  present  form  of  consciousness  is 

 

C  AA  REASON 

nothing else but the foregoing discordant relationship ofindivi 
d uali ty and its tru th the rela tionshi p of a cruel necessi ty by which 
the  former  is  oppressed  For  us  the  preceding  movement 
appears to stand over against the new form  because the latter 
in itself has  resulted  from  it  and  the  moment  from  which  it 
has come is therefore necessary for it but to the new form that 
moment appears as something already given  since it is  not  con 
scious of its origin and it holds that its essential nature is rather 
to be for its own self  or the negative element relatively to this 
positive  initself 

  This individuality therefore  directs its  energies  to  getcid

ting rid of this necessity which contradicts the law of the heart 
and also the suffering caused by it And so it is no longer characcid
terized  by the levity of the previous form of selfconsciousness 
which  only wanted  the  particular pleasure  of the individual 
on the  contrary  it is  the  earnestness of a  high purpose which 
seeks its pleasure in displaying  the excellence  of its own nature 
and in  promoting  the  welfare  of mankind  What it realizes is 
itself the law and its pleasure is  therefore atthe same  time the 
universal pleasure of all hearts  To it the  two  are  undivided 
its pleasure is  what  conforms  to  the  law  and  the  realization 
ofthelaw of universal humanity procures for it its own particucid
lar pleasure For within its own self individualityand theneces 
sary are immediately one the law is  the law of the heart Indivicid
duality is  not as  yet dislodged from  its  seat  and  the  unity of 
both has not been  brought about  by the  mediating agency of 
the individuality itself  has not yet been achieved by discipline 
The realization of the immediate undisciplined nature passes for 
a  display of its  excellence and as  productive of the  welfare  of 
humanity 

  The law on the other hand which confronts the law of 
the heart is separated fronl the heart and exists in its own right 
H umani ty which is bound by this law does not live in the blessed 
unity of the Jaw  with the  heart  but either lives in their cruel 
separation and in suffering  or at least dispenses  with the  encid
joymentofitselfin obeying the law and lacks the consciousness 
of its  own  excellence in  transgressing  it  Because  that  authoricid
tative divine and human ordinance is separated from the heart 
it is  for the latter a  mere show which ought to lose  what is  still 
associated  with it  viz  the  power of authority and  reality  In 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

its content it may well by chance agree with the law of the heart 
and  then  the latter can submit  to  it  but for  the  heart  what 
is  essential is  not the bare conformity  to  law as  such  but  that 
in the law it has  the  consciousness  of itsefh  that therein it has 
satisfied  itself  Where  however  the  content  of  universal 
necessity does not agree with  the heart then necessity  even as 
regards its content is in itself nothing and must give way before 
the law of the  heart 

  The individual then carries out the law of his heart This 
becomes a  universal ordinance and pleasure  becomes  a  reality 
which absolutely conforms  to  law But in  this  realization  the 
law  has  in  fact  escaped  the  individual  it  directly  becomes 
merely the relation which was  supposed  to  be got rid  of  The 
law of the heart through its very realization ceases to be a  law 
of the  heart  For  in  its  realization  it receives  the  form  of an 
affirmative  being  and is  now a  universal power for  which  this 
particular heart is  a  matter of indifference  so  that  the indivicid
dual by setting up his  own ordinance no longer finds it to be 
his own  CQnSeqJlently  what theindividual brings into  being 
through thereaHzation ofbis law is not hislaw on the contrary 
since the realization is in principle bis own hut actually is  for 
him analienaffair what he brings aboutis merely the entanglecid
mentof himself in the  actual  ordinance  an  entanglement  in 
it Inorover notas a superior power which is only aien to him 
but one which is hostile By his act he places himselfin or rather 
posits himself as  the universal element of existent reality  and 
his  act is  supposed  to  have  even  according  to  his  own  intercid
pretation the value ofa universal ordinance But he has thereby 
freed himselffrorn himself he goes on growing qua  universality 
on his own account and purges himselfofhis particularity The 
individual who wants to recognize universality only in the form 
of his  immediate  being  forself does  not  therefore  recognize 
himself in  this  free  universality  while  at  the  same  time  he 
belongs to it for it is  his  doing  This doing  therefore  has  the 
reverse significance it contradicts the universal ordinance Jr 
the individuals act is  supposed  to  be  the act of his  particular 
heart not a free universal reality and at the same time he has 
in fact  recognized the  latter  for  his  action  has  the  significance 
of positing bis  essential  being as  a  free  reality  ie  of acknowcid
ledging  the real  world  to  be his  own  essential  being 

 

C  AA  REASON 

  The individual has by the principle of his action detercid

mined the more precise  way in which  the actual  universality 
to which he has attached himself  turns against him  His deed 
qua actuality belongs to the universal but its content is  his own 
individuality  which  as  this  particular individuality  wants  to 
preserve i tselfin opposi tion to the universal I t is not any specific 
law the settingup of which would be in question on the  concid
trary  the  immediate  unity  of the  individual  heart  with  unicid
versaity is  the  thought  elevated into a  supposedly valid law 
that in whads law every heart must recognize its own self  But 
only the heart of this individual has placed its reality in its deed 
which expresses for him his beingforself or his pleasure The deed 
is  supposed to  have immediately the status  of a  universal  that 
is  to say  it  is  in  truth  something  particular  and  has  merely 
the form  of universality  the particular content of the  heart  as 
such is supposed to have the statusofa universa Consequently 
others do  not find  in  this  content the fulfilment of the  law  of 
their hearts  butrather that of someone else  and  precisely in 
accordance with the universal law that each shall find in what 
is law his own heart they turn against the reality he set up just 
ashe turned against theirs  Thus justas the individual at first 
finds only the rigid law now he finds the hearts ormen themcid
selves  opposed  to  his  excellent intentions and detestable 

  Because  this  consciousness  at first  knows  universality 
only  as  immediate  and  necessity  as  necessity  of the  heart  the 
nature of the realization and  the activity is  unknown to  it it 
does not know that thisrealization as  what affirmatively  is  is  in 
truth rather the implicit universal in which  the individuality of 
consciousness  which entrusts itself to it in order to be  this parcid
ticular  immediate  individuality  really  perishes  instead  of 
acquiring a  being of its  own it therefore  attains  to  being  the 
aliention of itself But that in which it does notrecognize itself 
is  no longer a dead necessity  but a  necessity animated by the 
universal  individuality  It took this divine  and  human  ordicid
nance which  it found  as  an  accepted authority to  be  a  dead 
authority in which not only its own selfto which it clings  as 
this  particular independent heart opposed  to  the universalcid
but also  those  subject  to  that  ordinance  would  have  no  concid
sciousnessofthemselves but it finds that this ordinance is really 
animated by the consciousness of all  that it is  the law of every 

ACTUALIZATION  OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

heart I t learns from experience that the reality is a vivified ordicid
nance  and  it learns  this in fact  precisely in  realizing  the  law 
ofits own heart for this means nothing else than that individucid
ality becomes  an object  to itself in  the  form  of universality in 
which  however  it does  not recognize itself 

  Thus  what emerges  from  the  experience  of this  shape 

of selfconsciousness as  the true contradicts what this consciouscid
ness  isfor itself  But what it is  for  itself  has  itself the  form  of 
absolute universality for it and it is  the law of the heart which 
is immediately one with the  consciousness  of self  At the same 
time the established living order is equally its own essential being 
and  work  it produces nothing else  but that  that  order is  in 
equally immediate  unity  with  selfconsciousness  In this  way 
selfconsciousness  is  related  to  a  twofold  antithetic  essence 
it is in its own selfacontradiction and is distraught in its inmost 
being  The law of this  particular heart is  alone  that  in  which 
selfconsciousness  recognizes  itself  but  the  universally  valid 
order has  through  the  realizing of that  law  equally  become 
for selfconsciousnessitsown essential heingand its own reality 
Thus what contradicts i tselfinitsconsciousness hasfor it in each 
case  the form of essence  and of its own reality  

   In giving expression to this moment of its selfconscious 
downfall  as  the  result  of its  experience  it  reveals  itself to  be 
this  inner perversion of itself  to  be  a  deranged  consciousness 
which findsthat its essential being is immediately nonessential 
its reality immediately an unreality The derangement cannot 
be  taken to mean that in general something devoid  of essence 
is regarded as  essentialsomethingunrealas real so  that what 
for  one person is essential or real would not be so for another 
and that the consciousness ofrealityand unreality or ofessenti 
alityand unessentiality would  thus fall  apart  If something is 
in  fact  real  and  essential  for  consciousness  in  general  but  is 
not so for me then in the consciousness of its nothingness I have 
at  the  same  timesinte I  am  consciousness  in  generalthe 
consciousness  of its  reality  and  since  they  are  both  fixed  in 
my consciousness this is  a unity which is  madness in general 
But in  this  state  only  an  object  is  deranged  for  consciousness 
not consciousness as  such within and for  itself  But in the outcid
come of experience which here has come to view consciousness 
in  its  law  is  aware  of being  itself this  reality  and  at  the  same 

c  AA  REASON 

 
time  since  the  very  same  essentiality  the  same  reality  is 
alienated from it it is qua selfconsciousness qua absolute reality 
aware ofits own unreality In other words it holds the two sides 
in  their  contradiction  to  be  immediately  its  essential  being 
which is  thus in its inmost  being distraught 

  The heartthrob for  the welfare of humanity therefore 
passes into the ravings of an insane selfconceit into the fury of 
consciousness to preserveitselffrom destruction and it does this 
by expelling from itself the perversion which it is itself and by 
striving to look on it and express it as something else I t therefore 
speaks of the universal order as  a  perversion of the law of the 
heart and  of its  happiness  a  perversion invented  by fanatical 
priests gluttonous despots and their minions who compensate 
themselves  for  their  own  degradation  by  degrading  and 
oppressing others  a  perversion which  has  led  to the  nameless 
misery  of deluded  humanity  In  this  its  derangement  concid
sciousness  declares  individuality  to  be  the  source  of this  decid
rangementandperversion but one that is alien and accid ental 
I t is  the heart  however  or the  individuality of consciousness 
that would  be immediately universal  that is  itself the source 
of this  derangement and  pervrsionand  the  outcome  of its 
actipn is  merely  that  its  consiousnes  becomes  aware  of this 
contradiction For the True isJor it the law oftheheartome
thing merely intcrlded  which  unlike  the established  order  has 
OQt stood  the tet Qf time  bu t ra ther when thus  tested  is  over  
thrown This its law ought to have reality  the law  then is  for 
i tquqreaitYlquavalid ordinanccitsownaimandessen tial nature 
but reaJity  that very Jaw qua  valid ordinance  is on  the  contrary 
immediately for it somethihg which is  not valid  Similarly its 
own reality the heart itselfas a particular individual consciouscid
ness is for it its essence butits purpose is  to establish that parcid
ticular individuality as  an  objective  being  Thus it is  rather 
its self as  not  a  particular individual  that is  immediately for it 
its essence or its purpose has the form of a  law hence the form 
of a universality which it is for its  own consciousness  This its 
Notion  becomes  by its  own  action  its  object  thus  the  heart 
learns  rather that its self is  not real  and  that its  reality is  an 
unreality  It is  therefore not an accidental and alien individucid
ality  but just this  partjcular heart  which in all  its  aspects  is 
in  its  own self  perverted  and  perverting 

ACTUALIZATION  OF SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

  While however the immediately  universal individuality 

is  perverted  and  the  source  of perversion  this  universal  ordicid
nance since it is  the law of all hearts  ie  of what is  perverted 
is  no  less  itself essentially  perverted  as  the  ravings  of  the 
deranged consciousness declared On the one hand  this  ordicid
nance  proves itself to  be a  law of all  hearts  by  the  resistance 
which  the law of one individual  heart  encounters  from  other 
individuals The established laws are defended against the law 
of an individual because they are not an unconscious  empty 
and dead necessity but a spiritual universality and Substance 
in which those in whom this spiritual substance has its actuality 
live as individuals and are conscious of themselves  so that even 
when they complain about this ordinance as if it  went  against 
their own inner law  and  maintain  against  it  the opinions  of 
the heart they cling to it with their hearts as being their essencid
tial being  and if this  ordinance is  taken from  them  or  they 
place themselves outside it they lose everything Since it is precid
cisely in this that the reality and power of public order consist 
the  latter  thus  appears  as  the  selfidentical  essence  alive  in 
everyone and individuality appears as  its form  But  this  ordicid
nance is  eq ually  a  perversion 

  The fact that it is  the law of all  hearts  that all  indivi 
duals are immediately this universal means that the ordinance 
is a reality which is only that of the individuality that isfor itself 
or as only the reality of the heart The consciousness which sets 
up  the  law  of its  heart  therefore  meets  with  resistance  from 
others because it contradicts the equally individual laws of their 
hearts j  and  these  others in their resistance are  doing  nothing 
else but setting up and claiming validity for their own law The 
universal that we have here is  then only a  universal resistance 
and  struggle of all  against one another in which each  claims 
validity  for  his own individuality  but at  the  same  time  does 
not succeed in his  efforts  because  each  meets  with  the  same 
resistance from  the others  and is  nullified  by  their redprocal 
resistance What seems to be public order  then is  this universal 
state of war in which each wrests what he can for himself execid
cutes justice on  the individuality of others and  establishes  his 
own which is equally nullified through the action of the others 
It is  the way of the world  the show of an unchanging course 
that  is  only  meant  to  be  a  universality  and  whose  content  is 

c  AA  REASON 

rather the essenceless play of establishing and nullifying indivi 
dualities 

  Ifwe contrast the two sides of the universal ordinance 
we see that this latter universality has for its content the restless 
individuality which regards mere  opinion or individuaHty as 
law  what is  real  as  unreal  and  what is  unreal as  real  But it 
is  at the same time the side of the reality of the ordinance for 
to it belongs the individualitys heingforself  The other side is 
the universal in the form of a  tranquil essence  bu tit is  for that 
very reason only something inner which though not absolutely 
nonexistent still has no reality and can itself become a  reality 
only  by getting  rid  of the  individuality  which  has  arrogated 
reality to itself  This shape of consciousness which  in  the law 
is  aware of itself  which knows itself in  what is  intrinsically  true 
and good  not  as  an  individuality  but  only as  it  becomes  an 
essential  being and which knows individuality to be  perverted 
and the source of perversion and therefore knows it must sacri 
fice the individuality of consciousnessthis shape of conscious 
ness is  Virtue 

c  Virtue  and the  way  of the  world 

  In  the  first  shape  of active  Reason  selfconsciousness 
took  itself to  be  pure individuality  and it was  confronted  by 
an empty universality In the second  the two sides of the anti  
thesis each had  both moments within them  law and  individucid
ality  but one side  the heart  was  their immediate unity  the 
other their antithesis  Here  in  the  relationship  of virtue  and 
the way of the world the two members are each severally the 
unity and anti thesis of these moments or are each a  movement 
oflaw and individualitytowards one another but a  movement 
of opposition For the virtuous consciousness law is  the essential 
moment andindividualitytheone to be nullified and therefore 
both in its oWn consciousness as well asin the way of the world 
In the former  case  ones  own  individuality  is  to  be  brought 
under the discipline of the universal the intrinsically true and 
good but under that discipline it still remains a  personal concid
sciousness True discipline requires nothing less  than the sacricid
ficeofthe entire personality as proof that individual peculiaricid
ties are in fact no longer insisted on In this individual sacrifice 
the individuality in the way of the world  is  at  the same time 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

eradicated for it too is  a simple moment common to  both  In 
the  way of the  world  individuality behaves in  a  way  which 
is the reverse Dfits behaviour in the virtuous consciousness  viz 
it makes itself the essential moment whereas what is intrinsically 
good and true it subordinates to itself  Further the way of the 
world too is  for  virtue not merely this universal which is per 
verted by individuality  on the contrary the absolute order is  like 
wise  a common moment only one that is  not present for  con 
sciousness  as  an existent  reality  bu t  as  the  inner  essence  of the 
way of the world  That order  strictly speaking  has  not first 
to be broughtinto existence by virtue for to bring into existence 
is qua action a consciousness ofindividuality and individuality 
is really what has to be nullified but this nullifying ofindividu 
ality merely makes room as it were for the initself of the way 
of the world  to  enter into existence  on its  own account 

  The genera content of the actual way of the world  we 
already know looked  at more closely  it is  again nothing else 
but the two  preceding movements of selfconsciousness From 
them has issued  the shapeQf virtue  since  they  are  its  origin 
they are antecedent to it but virtue proceeds to Dllllify its ori 
gin  and  to  realize  itself  in other  words  to  becomeor itself 
The way of the world is  thus  on the one hand  the single in 
dividuality which seeks  its  own  pleasure  and  enjoyment  It 
is  true  that in doing so  it destroys itself  and  thus satisfies  the 
universal but this very satisfaction like theret of the moments 
of this  relationship  is  a  perverted form  and  movement of the 
universal The reali ty is  only the individuality of the pleasure 
and enjoyment to which however  the universal is  opposed  a 
necessity which is  merely  the  empty  form  of the  universal  a 
merely negative reaction and an action devoid of content The 
other  moment of the  way of the  world  is  the  individuality 
which claims to be law in its own right  and in its own conceit 
disturbs  the  existing order  The universal  law it is  true  precid
serves  itself in  face  of this  conceit  and  no  longer  makes  its 
appearance as something opposed to consdousness and empty 
of content as a blind necessity but as a necessity witkin consciouscid
ness itself But when it exists as  the conscious relation of an absocid
lutely contradictory reality it is madness as an objective reality 
however  it  is  perversion  in  general  The  universal  then 
does  dispJay  itself in  both  aspects  as  the  might  which  moves 

 

C  AA  REASON 

them  but  the  existence  of  this  might  is  merely  a  universal 
perversion 

  It is from virtue now that the universal is  to receive its 

true reality by nullifying individuality the principle of the percid
version  Virtues purpose is  by so  doing  to  reverse  again the 
perverted  way of the  world  and  to  make  manifest  its  true 
essence  This  true  essence  is  at first  only implicit  in  the  way 
of the  world  only  its  initself  it  is  not  yet  actual  and  concid
sequently virtue only  believes  it  This  faith  virtue  proceeds  to 
raise to sight without however enjoying the fruits of its labour 
and sacrifice For in so far as it is an individuality it is  the activity 
of the conflict it wages with the way of the world but its aim 
and  true  nature is  to  conquer  the  reality  of the  way  of the 
world  The bringing into existence of the  good  thus  effected 
is  thus the cessation of its activity  or of the consciousness  of indivi 
duality  What will  be  the outcome of this  conflict itself  what 
virtue learns from it whether by the sacrifice it makes of itself 
the  way of the world succumbs  while  virtue  triumphsthis 
must be decided by theriature of the living weapons borne by 
the combatants For the weapons are nothing else butthe nature 
of the  combatants themselves  a  nature which only  makes  its 
appearance for both of them reciprocally  Whattheir weapons 
are is  already  evident  from  what is  implicitly  present in  this 
conflict 

  The universal  is  true for  the virtuous consciousness in 
its faith or is implicitly true i tis no t yetan actual bu tan abstract 
universality in this consciousness itselfit is present as a purpose 
in  the  way of the  world  as  an inner  principle  It is  precisely 
in this determination that the universal is present in virtue too 
in relation to the way of the world For virtue as yet only wills 
to accomplish the good and does not to begin with claim that 
it is a  reality  This characteristic can also  be  looked  at in this 
way  the good in making its  appearance in the  conflict  with 
the way of the world  thereby presents itself as  being for  an 
other  as something that does not have a  being  of its  own  for 
otherwise it would not want to make itself true by conquering 
its opposite That it is  to  begin with  only for  an other  means 
the same as was shown in the opposite way of looking at it viz 
that it  is  to  begin  with  an abstraction  which  has  reality  not 
in its own right but only in its relation to the way of the world 

t 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

  The good  or  the  universal  then  as  it  comes  to  view 
there is  what are called gifts  capacities  powers  It is  a  mode 
of the spiritual in which it is represented as a  universal which 
requires the principle of individuality to give it life and  move 
ment  and in  this  principle  has  an  actual  existence  This  uni 
versal is  put to good use  by the principle of individuality in so 
far as  thIs  principle lives in  the  virtuous  consciousness  but is 
misused in so far as it dings to the way of the worlda passive 
instrument which  controlled  by a  free  individuality which  is 
indifferent to the use it makes of it can also be misused for the 
production of an  actual existence which destroys  it  a  lifeless 
material  lacking  an  independence  of its  own  which  can  be 
formed  this  way or that or even  to its    ruin 

  Since this universal is equally at the disposal of the vircid

tuous  consciousness  and  the  way  of  the  world  it  is  not 
apparent whether  virtue  thus  armed  will  conquer  vice  The 
weapons are the same  they are  these  capacities  and  powers 
Virtue has  it is  true  held in reserve  its  belief in the  original 
unity of its  own purpose and  the essential  nature of the  way 
of the world  a reserve  that is  intended  to  faU  on  the  enemy 
from  the rear during the figh t  and in principle to  achieve that 
aim  As  a  matter of fact  therefore the knight of vittues own 
part in the fighting is strictly speaking a  shamfight which he 
cannot take seriouslybecause he knows  that his  true strength 
lies in the fact that the good exists absolutely in its own right 
Le  brings itself to fulfilmenta shamfight which he also dare 
not  anow  to  become  serious  For  what  he  turns  against  the 
enemy and finds  turned against himself  and what he runs the 
risk  of wasting and  damaging both in  his  own case as  well  as 
that of the eneIlY  is  not to be the good itself  for  he fights  to 
preserve and actomplish that What are risked in the fight are 
only the gifts and capacities which are not themselves at issue 
But thse arc in fact nothing else but just that very universal 
in which individuality has been nullified which is supposed to 
be preserved and realized by the conflict But at the same time 
this  universal s already  realized  directly  by the  very notion  of 
the conflict it is  the initsef the  universal  and  its  realization 
means  merely this  that it is  at  the same  time  for  an  other 
The two aspects  specified  above  in accordance  with  each of 
which it became an abstraction are no longer separated it is 

c  AA  REASON 

especially in  and  through  the  conflict  that  the  good  is  estabcid
lished  in  both  modes  The  virtuous  consciousness  however 
enters into conflict with the way of the  world  as  if this  were 
something opposed  to  the good  what the  conflict  offers  to  it 
is  the universal  not merely as  an abstract universal  but as  a 
universal animated by individuality and existing for an other 
in  other  words  the  actual  good  Therefore  wherever  virtue 
comes to grips with the way of the world it always hits upon 
places which are the actual existence of the good  itself which 
as  the  initselfof the  wa y of the  world  is  inextricably  in tercid
woven in every  manifestation of the way of the  world  And 
in  the actuality of that  initself  virtue  has  its  own  existence 
too for virtue therefore the way of the world is invulnerable 
All  the  moments  which  in  virtue  itself were  supposed  to  be 
risked  and sacrificed are just such existences of the good  and 
hence  are inviolable relationships  Consequently  the  conflict 
cn only be an oscillation  between preserving and  sacrificing 
or rather tbere can be neither a sacrifice of what is  ones  own 
nor a  viQItion Qf what is alien  Virtue is  not  merely  like  the 
combatant who in the Gonflict is only concerned with keeping 
his sword  brightbut it has  even started  the fightjn  order  to 
preserve  the  weapons  And  not  orily  can  it  not  use  its  own 
weapops  it mustalso preserve intact those of theenem y  and 
prgect them  against its own attack for  all are noble parts of 
the good  on behalf of which it went into battle 

  For this enemy on the other hand what is  the essence 
is  not  theinitself  the  implicit  universal  but  individuality  its 
power  therefore  is  the  negative  principle  for  which  nothing 
is  established  or  absolutely  sacred  but  which  can  risk  and 
endure  the loss  of anything and everything  In doing so  it is 
just ascertain of victory through its own resources as through 
the contradiction in which its opponent gets  entangled  What 
virtueholcls to bean intrinicbingJhewayofthewolld regards 
as mereJy an indifferent object it is free from every principle 
that virtue holds  to  be  established  and  by which it is  bound 
Such a principle the way of the world has in its  power  since 
it regards it as  something it  can  either set  aside  or let  be  as 
it can also the virtuous knight who is fast  bound by it The latter 
cannot disentangle himselffrom it as  ifit were a cloak thrown 
round  him  from  which  he  could  free  himself  by  leaving  it 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

behind for  to him it is something essential which he must not 
gIve  up 

gBBFinally as regards the ambush from which the intrinsiccid
ally good is  to  attack  the  way  of the  world  cunningly  from 
the rear this is  essentially a vain hope The way of the world 
is the alert selfassured consciousness that cannot be got at from 
behind but faces in every direction for its nature is that everycid
thing is merely an object for it  that everything stands in front 
of it  But when the intrinsically good is  an  indifferent  object 
for the enemy  then it is  involved in the conflict we have seen 
but in so  far  as  it is  not such an object  but  possesses  intrinsic 
being  it  is  the  passive  instrument  of gifts  and  capacities  a 
material lacking reality Ifrepresented as a real being it would 
be a dormant consciousness one remaining in the background 
no one knows  where 

gg  Virtue therefore is conquered by the way of the world 
because its purposeis in fact  the abstract  unreal essence  and 
because its action as  regards reality rests on distinctions which 
are purely nornfnal It wanted to consist  in  bringing the good 
into actual eistence  by  the sacrifice  of individuality  but  the 
side of reality is itselfnothing else  but the side of individuality 
Thegood was supposed to be that which has an implicitheing 
and to be opposed to what is  buttheinitsel taken in its real 
and true sense  is  rater being  itself  The initself is  in  the first 
instance  the abstraction  Q essence  in contrast  to  reality  but an 
abstraction is  precisely whatis not true but exists onlyor concid
sciousness  which means  however  that it is  itself what is  called 
real  for  the  real  is  that  whih is  essentially for  an  other  or is 
being  But  the  consciousness  of virtue  rests  on  this  distinction 
between the initselfand being a distinction which has no truth 
The  way of the  world  was supposed  to be  the  perversion  of 
the  good  because  it  had  individuality  for  its  principle  only 
individuality is the principle of the real world for it is  precisely 
individuality that is consciousness whereby what exists in  itself 
exists  eq ually for  an  other  it does  pervert  the  U nchangea bIe 
but it perverts it in  fact  from  the  nothing   abstraction  into  the 
being  of reality 

  Thus  the  way  of the  world  triumphs  over  what  in 
opposition to it constitutes virtue  triumphs over that which is 
the  essenceless  abstraction  of essence  However  it  does  not 

C  AA  REASON 

 
triumph  over  something  real  but  over  the  creation  of  discid
tinctions that are no distinctions it glories in this pompous talk 
about doing what is  best for  humanity  about  the  oppression 
of humanity about making sacrifices for  the sake  of the good 
and the misuse of gifts  Ideal entities and purposes of this  kind 
are empty ineffectual words which lift up the  heart but leave 
reason unsatisfied which edify  but raise  no  edifice  declamacid
tions which specifically declare merely this that the individual 
who professes to act for such noble ends and who deals in such 
fine phrases is in his own eyes an excellent creaturea puffingcid
up which inflates  him with a  sense  of importance in  his  own 
eyes  and in  the  eyes  of others  whereas  he is  in fact  inflated 
with  his  own conceit 

Virtue in the ancient world  had its own definite sure meancid

ing for it had in the spiritual substance of the nation a foundation 
full  of meaning and for its purpose an actual good  already in 
existence  Consequently  too  it was  not  directed against  the 
actual world as againstsomething generally perverted and against 
a  way of the world But the virtue we are considering has  its 
bdngoutside of the spiritual substance  it is  an unreal virtue 
a virtue in imagination and name only  which lacks  that subcid
stantial  content  The  emptiness  of  this  rhetoric  which 
denounces the  way of the  world  would  be  at once  revealed 
if the meaning of its fine phrases had to be stated These therecid
fore are assumed to be something the meaning of which is famicid
liar  The request  to say  what  this  familiar  meaning  is  would 
be  met either by  a  fresh  flood  of phtlses  or  by atl  appeal  to 
the heart which inwardly says what they meanwhich amounts 
to admitting that it is  in fact  unable to say  what  the  meaning 
is The fatuousness of this rhetoric seems too in an unconscious 
way to have come to be a  certainty for the culture of our time 
since all interest in the  whole  mass  of such  rhetoric  and  the 
wayitis used to boost ones ego has vanisheda loss ofinterest 
which  is  expressed in  the fact  that  it  produces only  a  feeling 
of boredom 

  The result  then which issues from  this antithesis  con 
sists in  the fact that consciousness drops like a  discarded  cloak 
its idea of a good  that exists   only  in principle but has as  yet 
no actual existence  In its  conflict  it has learnt  by  experience 
that the  way of the world  is  not  as  bad  as  it looked  for  its 

ACTUALIZATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

 

reality is  the reality of the universal  With this lesson in  mind 
the idea of bringing the good  into  existence  by  means  of the 
sacrifice of individuality is abandoned for individuality is  precid
cisely the actualizing of what exists  only in principle and the 
perversion  ceases  to  be  regarded  as  a  perversion  of the  good 
for it is in fact really the conversion of the good as  a mere End 
into an actual existence  the movement of individuality is  the 
reality of the  universal 

  However  with  this  result  that  which  as  the  way  of 
the world stood  opposed  to the consciousness of what existed 
 only in principle has in fact likewise been conquered and has 
vanished  In  that  antithesis  individualitys  beingforself was 
opposed  to essence or the universal  and appeared as  a  reality 
separated from  what exists   only  in  itself or in principle  But 
since reality has shown itself to  be in undivided unity with the 
universal then just as  the initself of virtue is  merely an aspect 
so  does  the  beingforself of the way of the world  also  prove 
to be  no more than that  The individuality of the  way of the 
world may well imagine that it acts only for  itself or in its own 
interest  It is  better than it thinks  for its action is  at the same 
time  an implicitly  universal  action  When  it  acts  in  its  own 
interest  it simply does  not know what it  is  doing  and  when 
it avers that everyone acts in his own interest it is merely assertcid
ing  that  no one knows  what  action is  When  it acts for  itself 
it simply gives reality to what to begin with exists only in itself 
The purpose of its beingforself  which it imagines is  opposed 
to what virtue is  in itself  its shallow cunning  as  also its  finecid
spun  explanations  which  know  how  to  demonstrate  the  precid
sence of selfinterest in every actionall these  have vanished 
just as the purpose of virtue that exists only in  itself  along with 
its  rhetoric  have vanished 

  Thus the activity of individuality all that it does  is in 
its own self an End the employment of its powers the play of 
these  powers in action is  what gives  them life  otherwise  they 
would be a lifeless initself But the initselfis not an unrealized 
abstract universal  that lacks  an  existence  but  rather is  itself 
immediately the present real existence of the process of indivicid
duality 

c  AA  REASON 

C  INDIVIDUALITY  WHICH  TAKES  ITSELF  TO  BE  REAL  IN 

AND  FOR  ITSELF 

individuality  The 

  Selfconsciousness has now grasped the Notion of itself 
which  to  begin with  was only our Notion of it  viz  that in its 
certainty of itself it is  all  reality  and  End  and  essence  are for 
it henceforth  the spontaneous interfusion  of the  universalof 
gifts  and  capacitiesand 
individual 
moments of this fulfilling  and  interfusion prior  to  the  unity in 
which  they have coalesced  are  the  Ends  hitherto considered 
These have vanished being abstractions and chimeras belongcid
ing to  those first  shallow shapes  of spiritual  selfconsciousness 
and having their truth only in the imaginary being of the heart 
in imagination  and  rhetoric  not in Reason  This  being  now 
absolutely certain of its reality  no longer seeks  only to realize 
itself as  End in an antithesis  to  the reality which immediately 
confronts it but on  the  contrary  has  the  category  as  such for 
the object of its consciousness 

I n  other  words  selfconsciousness  determined  as  being for 
itseif  or as  the  negative  selfconsciousness  in  which  Reason  at 
first  made  its  appearance  is  set  aside  this  selfconsciousness 
came face  to face  with a  reality supposedly  the negative of it 
and only by overcoming it did it realize its  End But since End 
and  intrinsic  heing  have  proved  to  be  the  same  as  beingforancid
other and the reality confronting it  truth is  no longer separated 
from certainty no matter whether the  proposed  End  is  taken 
as certainty of self and the realization ofit as  truth or whether 
the End is  taken for  truth and the reality for certainty On the 
contrary intrinsic being and End in  and for  itself are  the  cercid
tainty of immediate reality itself  the interfusion ofheingMinitselj 
and  heingforitselj  of the  universal  and  individuality  Action 
is  in its  own self its  truth and  reality  and  individuality  in  its 
settingforth or expression is  in  relation  to  action  the  End in 
and  for  itself 

 With this  Notion  of itself  therefore  selfconrcousness 
has  returned  into  itself out  of those  opposed  detenninations 
which the category had for it and which characterized  the  re 
lation of selfconsciousness  to the  category in its  observational 
and  also  active  roles  It has  for  its  object  the  pure  category 
itself  or it  is  the  category  which  has  become  aware  of itself 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

Its account with its previous shapes is  thereby closed  they  lie 
forgotten  behind it and no longer confront it as  a  world given 
to  it  but  are  developed  solely  within  itself  as  transparent 
moments  Yet they still fall  apart within its  consciousness  as  a 
movement  of distinct moments  a  movement which  has  not yet 
brought them  together into their substantial  unity  But in all 
these moments selfconsciollsness holds fast to the simple unity 
of objective  being and  the self  a  unity which is  its genus 

  In so doing consciousness has cast away all opposition 
and every  condition  affecting its  action  it starts  afresh  from 
itself  and is  occupied  not with an other  but with  itself  Since 
individuality is in its own self actuality the material of its efforts 
and the aim of action lie in the action itself  Action has  there 
fore  the appearance of the movement of a  circle which moves 
freely within itselfin a void which unimpeded now expands 
now contracts and is perfectly content to operate in and  with 
its  own self  The element in which individuality sets  forth  its 
shape has the significance solely of putting on the shape of incid
dividuality it is  the daylight in which  consciousness  wants  to 
display itself  Action alters nothing and  opposes nothing  It is 
the pure form of a transition from  a  state of not being seen  to 
one of being seen  and the  content which is  brought out into 
the daylight and displayed is nothing else but what this action 
already is  in itself  It is  implicit  this  is  its  form  as  a  unity in 
thought and it is actualthis is its form as anexistent unity Action 
itselfis a content only when in this determination of simplicity 
it is contrasted with its character as a transition and movement 

a  The spiritual animal kingdom and deceit  or the  fmatter in hand itself 
  This intrinsically  real  individuality is  at first  again  a 
single and specific one The absolute reality which it knows itself 
to be is therefore as it will become aware an abstract  universal 
reality lacking filling  and  content  merely the empty  thought 
of this category We have to see how this Notion ofintrinsically 
real individuality characterizes itself in its moments  and  how 
its  Notion of itself enters into its  consciousness 

  The Notion of this individuality which as  such knows 
itself to  be all  reality  is  to  begin  with  a  result  it  has  not yet 
set forth its movement and reality and is  posited  here  immedzcid
ately as a simpleirtitself or implicit being  Negativity  howeve 

C  AA  REASON 

 
which  is  the  same  as  that  which  is  manifested  as  move 
ment is present in the simple initself as a determinateness and 
mere  being  or  the simple initself  becomes  a  definite  range 
of being Accordingly individuality appears on the scene as an 
original determinate nature original for it is implicit originally 
determinate  for  the negative moment is  present  in  the  initself 
and this latter is  thus a quality  This limitation of being howcid
ever cannot limit the action of consciousness for here consciouscid
ness  is  a  relation  purely of itself to  itself  relation  to  an  other 
which  would  he  a  limitation  of it  has  been  eliminated  The 
original  determinateness  of  the  nature  is  therefore  only  a 
simple principle a transparent universal element in which  the 
individuality  remains  as  free  and  selfidentical  as  it  is  uncid
irnpeded in unfolding its different moments and in its realizacid
tion is  simply in a reciprocal relation with itself just as  in the 
case  of indeterminate animal  life  which  breathes  the  breath 
oflife let us say into the element of water or air or earth and 
within  these  again  into  more  specific  principles  steeping  its 
entire nature in them and  yet keeping  that  nature  under its 
own control and preservingitselfas a unity in spi te of the limicid
tation iItJposed  by  the  element  and remaining in the farm of 
this  particulilr organization the saIne general animal life 

  This determinate original nature of consciousness which 
remains  free  and  entire  in  it  appears  as  the  immediate  alld 
sole  proper content  of that which for  the individual is  its  End 
Admittedly  it  is  a  determinate  content  but it is  only  a  content 
at all in so far as  we consider the initseifin isolation In truth 
however it  is  the  reality  that is  permeated  by  individuality 
actuality as  it is  present  in  consciousness  qua  individual  and 
it is  in  the first  instance  posited  as  merely  being  not yet  as 
acting But as regards action that determinateness is on the one 
hand not a limitation it would want to overcome for  regarded 
as an existent quality it is  the simple colour of the dement in 
which  it  moves  on  the  other  hand  however  negativity is  a 
determinateness only in being but action  is  itself nothing else  but 
negativity Therefore when individuality acts deternlinateness 
is  dissolved  in  the general process of negativity or in  the  sum 
total  of every determinateness 

  In  action  and  the  consciousness  of action  the  simple 
original nature now splits up into the distinction which action

implies Action is present at first in the form of object  an object 
too  as  pertaining to consciousness  as  End  and hence opposed 
to  a  reality  already  given  The  second  moment  is  the  movecid
ment of the End conceived as passive and realization conceived 
as the relation of the End to the wholly formal actuality hence 
the idea of the transition itself or the means  The third moment 
is  finally  the object which is  no longer in the form of an End 
directly known by the agent to  be his  own  but as  brought out 
into the light of day and havingfor him  the form of an other 
The  Notion of this  sphere  req uires  that  these  various  aspects 
be grasped in such a way that the content in them remains the 
same  without any distinction  whether  between  individuality 
and being in general or between End as against individuality 
as  an original nature  or  between  End  and  the  given  reality 
or between the means and that reality as  an absolute  End  or 
betweenthe reality brought about by the agent as  against the 
End  or the original nature or the  means 

 I  First of all  then  the originally  determinate nature  or 
natural predisposition of individuality its immediate essence is 
notas yet posited as active and as such is called special capacity 
talent  character and so on This peculiar tinge  of Spirit is  to 
be  looked  on  as  the sole  content  of the  End  itself and  as  the 
sole reality Ifwe thought of consciousness as going beyondthat 
and as  wanting to give reality  to a  diiferentcontent  then we 
should be thinking ofit as a Nothing working towards Nothing 
Further  this  original essence  is  not merely  the content of the 
End  Qut  is  in itself the reality  as  well  which otherwise has the 
appearance of being a given  material of the action  of being a 
reality found to  begin  with  which is  to  be shaped  by the action 
That is to say action simply translates an initially implicit being 
into  a  being  that  is  made  explicit  the  beinginitself of the 
reality  opposed  to  consciousness  is  reduced  to  a  mere  empty 
show This consciousness then when bringing itself to act does 
not let itself be led astray by what is  merely the show of a given 
reality and equally it has to avoid floundering about in empty 
thoughts and Ends and has to hold on to the original  content 
ofits essence True this original content is only explicitfor con 
sciousness  when  the latter has  made it into a  reality  but  the 
distinction between a content which is explicitfor consciousness 
only withinconsciousness itself  and an intrinsic reality outside it 

C  AA  REASON 

no  longer  exists  Consciousness  must  act  merely in order that 
what it is  in  itself may become explicit for  it  in  other  words 
action is simply the comingtobe of Spirit as consciousness  What 
the latter is in  itself it knows therefore from  what it actually  is 
Accordingly an individual cannot know what he really is uncid
til he has made himselfa reality through action  However  this 
seems to imply that he cannot determine the End of his  action 
until he  has  carried  it  out  but  at  the  same  time  since  he  is 
a  conscious individual  he must have the action in front  of him 
beforehand as entirely his own ie as an End  The individual who 
is  going  to  act  seems  therefore  to  find  himself in  a  circle  in 
which  each  moment already presupposes  the  other  and  thus 
he  seems  unable  to find  a  beginning  because he  only  gets  to 
know his original nature which must be his  EndJrom the deed 
while in order to act he must have that End beforehand But 
for that very reason he has to start immediately and whtever 
the  circumstances  without further  scruples  about  beginning 
means or End proceed to  action for  his  essence  and  intrinsic 
nature is  beginning means and  EndaH in one  As  beginning 
this  nature is  present in the circumstances of the  action  and 
theintereslwhich the individuaLfinds in something is the answer 
alreadygiven to the question whether he should act and what 
should be done in a  given  case  For what seems  to he a given 
reality is in itself his own originalnature which has merely the 
illusory  appearance  of an  objective  beingan  appearance 
implied  in  the  Notion  of action  with  its  twofold  aspect  but 
which shows itself to be his own original nature by the nterest 
he takes in it  Similarly  the how or the means is determined 
in and for itself  Talent is likewise nothing else but the determicid
nate original individuality considered as  an inner  means  or as 
a transition from End to an achieved reality But the actual means 
and the real transition are  the  unity of talent  with the  nature 
of the matter in hand present in that interest talent represents 
in the means the side of action interest the side of content both 
are individuality itself  as  an interfusion  of being  and  action 
What we  have  therefore  is  a  set  of given  circumstances  which 
are in  themselves  the individuals own original nature next  the 
interest which treats them as its own  or as its End and  finally 
the  union  of these  and  the  abolition of the anti thesis  in  the 
means  This  union itself still  falls  within  consciousness  and  the 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

whole just considered is  one side of an antithesis  This illusory 
appearance of an antithesis which still remains is  removed  by 
the  transition  or the means for  the  means  is  a  unity  of inner 
and outer  the antithesis of the specific  character it  has  as  an 
inner means  It therefore rids itself of that character and  posits 
itselfthis unity of action and  beingequally as  an outer  as 
an individuality that has itselfbecome a reality ie an individucid
ality  which  is  posited  for  individuality  itself as   objectively 
existent In this way the entire action does not go outside itself 
either as circumstances or as End or means or as a work done 
  But  with  work  done  the  difference  of the  original 
natures seems to enter the work  like the individuals original 
nature which it expresses  is  something specific for  the negacid
tivity  implicit in  action  being  freely  discharged  by  it  as  an 
existent reality is present in the action as a  quality  Consciouscid
ness  however  as  against  the  work  is  determined  as  that  in 
which the quality is present as negativity in general ie as action  
it is  thus  the universal  as  against the specific  character of the 
work done  It can therefore compare one work with another 
and by so doing grasp individualities  themselves  as  different  it 
can regard an individual whose work is more wide  ranging as 
possessing greater energy of will or a richer nature ie a nature 
whose native quality is  less  limited and another on the  other 
hand  as  a  weaker and  poorer nature 

  In contrast with this unessential quantitative difference 
good and badwould express an absolute difference buthere 
this is  not in place  Whether something is  held  to  be good or 
bad it is in either case an action and  an activity in which an 
individuality exhibits and expresses itself  and for  that reason 
it is all good  and itwould strictly speaking  be impossible to 
say what badness was supposed  to be  What would  be  called 
a  bad  work  is  the  individual life  of a  specific  nature  which 
therein gives itself reality It would only be put down as a  bad 
work  by  a  comparing  reflection  which  howeverjs  an  idle 
affair  since  it goes  beyond  the  essential  nature  of the  workt 
which is  to  be a  self expression  of the individuality  and  in it 
looks for and demands something else no one knows what The 
comparison could only have regard to the above  mentioned difcid
ference But this being a quantitative difference is in itself not 
an  essential  one  and  here  specifically  because  the  things 

 

C  AA  REASON 

compared would be different works or individualities But these 
have  no  connection  with  one  another  each  is  purely  selfa 
related The original nature is alone the initself  or what could 
be  laid  down  as  a  standard  for  judging  the  work  and  concid
versely  Both  however  correspond  to  each  other  there  is 
nothingfor individuality wich has not been made so  by  it  or 
there is  no reality which is not individualitys own nature and 
doing  and  no  action  nor initself of individuality  that is  not 
real  and only these moments are  to  be  compared 

   Therefore  feelings  of exaltation  or  lamentation  or 
repentance are altogether out of place For all that sort of thing 
stems  from  a  mind  wch imagines  a  content  and  an  initself 
which are different from  the original nature of the individual 
and  the  actualcarryingout of it in the real world  Whatever 
it is  that the individual  does  and  whatever  happens  to  him 
that he has done himself  and  he is  that himself  He can have 
only the consciousness of the simple transference of himself from 
the night of possibility into  the  daylight of the  present  from 
theabstractinitselfinto the significance of actual peing and can 
have only the certainty that what happens to him in the latter 
is  nothing else  but what lay dormant in the former  It is  true 
that the  consciousness  of this  unity is  likewise  a  comparison 
but what is  compared is  merely an illusory appearance of an 
antithesis an appearance of the form  of antithesis  which for 
selfconscious Reason that is aware that individuality in its own 
selfis reality is nothing more than anjUusory show The indivicid
dual  therefore  knowing  that in his  actual  world  he  can find 
nothing else  but its  unity  with  himself  or only the  certainty 
of himself in the  truth  of that world  can  experience  only joy in 
himself 

   This is  the Notion which  consciousness forms  of itself 
of itself as  an absolute interfusion of individuality and  being 
Let us see whether this Notion is confirmed  by experience and 
whether its reality corresponds to it The work produced is  the 
reality which consciousness gives itself  it is  that in which  the 
individual is  explicitly for  himself what  he is  implicitly  or in 
himself and in such a manner that the consciousness for which 
the individual becomesexpicit in the work is  not the particucid
lar but the universal consciousness In his work he has placed 
himselfaltogetherin the dement of universality in the quality

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

less void of being  The consciousness which withdraws from its 
work  is  in fact  the  universal  consciousness  in  contrast  to its 
work  which  is  determinate  or  particularand  it  is  universal 
because it is  absolute negativity or action in this  antithesis  It 
thus  goes  beyond  itself in  the  work  and  is  itself the  qualitycid
less  void  which  is  left  unfilled  by its  work  But  if their  unity 
before  was  preserved  in  the  Notion  this  happened  simply 
because  the  work  qua  existent  was  sublated  But it is  supposed 
to exist and we have to see how io its existence the individuality 
will preserve its universality and will know how to satisfy itself 
In the first place we have to consider by itself the work procid
duced It has received into itself the whole nature of the indivicid
duality  Its being is  therefore itself an action in  which  all  difcid
ferences  interpenetrate  and  are  dissolved  The  work  is  thus 
expelled into an existence in which  the quality of the original 
nature  in  fact  turns  against  other  determinate  natures 
encroaches on  them  and  gets  lost  as  a  vanishing element  in 
this general process Although within the Notion of the objectively 
real  indi vidualityall  themomen tscircumstances  end 
means and realizationhave the same value and the original 
specific nature has the value of no more than a  universal elecid
ment on the other hand when this element becomes an obj eccid
tive being itsspecificcharacter as such comes to light in the work 
done  and  obtains its  truth in  its  dissolution  More  precisely 
the form  which  this  dissolution  takes  is  that  in  this  specific 
character  the individual  qua  this  particular  individual  has 
become aware of himself as  actual  but the specific  character 
is  not only the content of the reality  but equally its form  in 
other words  the  reality simply  as  such  is just  this  quality  of 
being opposed to selfconsciousness Looked at from this aspect 
the reality is  revealed  as  a  reality that has  vanished  from  the 
Notion and is  merely an alien reality that is found given The 
work is  ie  it exists for  other individualities  and  is  for  them 
an alien reality which they must replace by their own in order 
to obtain through their  action  the  consciousness  of their  unity 
with reality in other  words  their  interestin the  work  which 
stems from their original nature is something different from this 
works own  peculiar interest  which  is  thereby  converted  into 
something diffrent Thus the work  is  in general something 
perishable which is  obliterated by the counteraction of other 

C  AA  REASON 

 
forces and interests and really exhibits the reality of the indivi 
duality as  vanishing rather than as  achieved 

  Consciousness  then in doing its  work  is  aware of the 

antithesis ofdoing and being which in the earlier shapes of concid
sciousness  was at the same time the  beginning  of action  while 
here it is  only a  result  But in fact  this  antithesis  was  likewise 
the foundation  in  that  consciousness  proceeded  to  act  as  an 
implicitly real individuality for the action presupposed the specid
cific original nature as the initself of the individuality and the 
content  of that nature was  achievement  simply for  the  sake  of 
achievement Pure action  however is a  selfidentical form with 
which  therefore  the  specific  character  of the  original  nature is 
not  in  agreement  Here  as  elsewhere  it  is  a  matter  of incid
difference which of the two is  called Notion and which reality 
The original nature  has only an  ideal  existence  or is  the  incid
itselfin contrast to the action in which it first becomes a reality 
or in other words  the original nature is  the  being  both  of the 
individuality  as  such  and  of the individuality in  the  form  of 
work while action is the original Notion as  an absolute transicid
tion  or  as  the  comingto  be  of the  reality  This  disparity 
between Notion and  reality which lies in itsessence  is  learnt 
by consciousness  from  experience in its work  in work  therecid
fore  consciousness  becomes  what it is in  truth  and its empty 
Notion of itself vanishes 

  In this fundamental contradiction inherent in  work 
which is the truth of this essentially rea individualityalLthe 
aspects of the individuality thus appear again as contradictory 
that is  to say  the work  qua  the content of the whole individucid
ality when transferred from the doingofit which is the negative 
unity holding captive all the moments of that content  now lets 
the  moments  go  free  and  in  the  element  of  existence  they 
become indifferent to one another Notion and  reality are thus 
separated into purpose and that which is  the original  essenticid
ality It is accidental if the purpose has a truly essential nature 
or if the  initself is  made  the  purpose  Even  so  Notion  and 
reality again fall  apart as  a  transition  to reality and  as purpose 
in  other  words  it  is  accidental  if a  means  is  chosen  which 
expresses  the purpose  And  finally  the  entirety  of these  inner 
moments  whether they possess  an inner unity or not ie  the 
action  of the individual  is  again in  an  accidental  relationship 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

to  reality in general fortune  decides as  well in favour of an illcid
disposed purpose and an illchosen means as  against them 

B  If  now  consciousness is  thus  made aware in its  work 
of the antithesis of willing and achieving between end and means 
and again between this inner nature in its entirety and reality 
itself an antithesis which in general includes within it the conm 
tingency of its action yet  the unity and necessity of the action 
are no less  present  too The latter aspect overlaps  the former 
and the experience of the contingency of the action is itselfonly 
a contingent experience The necessity of the action consists in 
the fact that purpose is related simply to actuality  and this unity 
is  the Notion of action  action takes place because action is  in 
and for  itself the essence  of actuality  In  the  work  it is  true 
there  is  revealed  the  contingency  possessed  by  achievement 
when contrasted with willing and doing  and  this  experience 
which seems as ifit must he accepted as  truth contradicts that 
Notion of action  If  however  we  consider  the content of this 
experience  in its  completeness  it is  seen  to  be  the  vanishing 
work What is preserved is not the vanishing  the vanishing is 
itself actual and is bound up with the work and vanishes  with 
it  the  negative  itself perishes  along  with  the  positive  whose 
negti ve it is 

  This vanishing of the vanishing lies in the Notion of the 
intrinsically realindividuality itself for that in which the work 
vanishes or what vanishes in the work  and wnat was supposed 
to give experience as it was called its supremacy over individucid
alitys  own  Notion  of itself  is  the  objective  reality  Objective 
reality  however  is  a  moment which itself no longer possesses 
any truth on its own  account in this  consciousness  that truth 
consists solely in the unity of this consciousness with the action 
and the true work is only that unity of doing and being of willing 
and  achieving  Consciousness  then  because  of  the  fundacid
mental certainty ofits actions holds the reality opposed to that 
certainty  to  be  for  it  alone  for  selfconsciousness  which  has 
returned into itself  and for  which all  antithesis  has vanished 
antithesis can no longer take this form ofbeingJor itseLJin anti  
thesis to reality  On the contrary  then  the antithesis  and  the 
negativity manifested in work affect not merely the content of 
tlle  work or the content of consciousness as  well  but affect the 
reality as such  and  hence affect  the  antithesis  present in that 

c  AA  REASON 

reality  and  present only in virtue of it  and  the  vanishing  of 
the  work  In  this  way  then  consciousness  is  reflected  out  of 
its  perishable work into itself  and preserves its  Notion and  its 
certainty as what objectively exists and  endures in face  of the 
experience of the contingency  of action  I t  experiences in  point 
offact its Notion in which reality is only a moment ie somecid
thing for  consciousness  not  something  which  exists  in  its  own 
right it experiences it as a vanishing moment and reality therecid
fore has for consciousness only the value of being as such  whose 
universality is  one with action  This unity is  the  true work  it 
is the very heart of the matter die Sache selbstJ  which completely 
holds its own and is experienced as that which endures indepencid
dently of what is  merely  the  contingent  result  of an individual 
action  tlle  result  of contingent  circumstances  means  and 
reality 

  The  heart  of the  matter  is  only  opposed  to  these 
moments in so  far  as  they are supposed  to  be isolated  but  as 
an interfusion of the reality and the individuality it is essentially 
their unity his equally an action and qua action  pure action 
ingeneral hcncejustas muchan action of this particular indivicid
dual and this action as still hisj antithesis to reality is  a purcid
pose Equally it is the transition from this determinateness into 
the opposite and lastly itis a reality which is explicitly present 
for consciousness  The heart of the  matter  thus expresses  the 
spiritual  essentiality in  which  all  these  moments  have  lost  all 
validity of their own and are valid  therefore only as  universal 
and in which the certainty consciousness has of itself is an objeccid
tive entity an objective fact  for it  an object born of selfconcid
sciousness as its own  without ceasing to be a free object in the 
proper sense The Thing of sensecertainty and perception now 
acquires its significance through sefconsciousness and through 
it alone  on this  rests  the  distinction  between  a  Thing  and  a 
cause or a matter in hand A movement corresponding to that 
from  senseJ certainty to perception will  run its  course  here 
 I  In the matter in hand then in which the interfusion 

of individuality and objectivity has itselfhecome objective selfcid
consciousness has come into possession ofi ts  true Notion or has 
attained to a  consciousness of its substance  At the same time 
this consciousness as it exists here is one that has just now come 
into being and hence is  an immediate consciousness of its sub

stance and this is  the specific way in which spiritual being is 
present  here  it  has  not  yet  developed  into  a  truly  real  subcid
stance The matter in hand has in this immediate consciouscid
ness of its substance the form of simple essence which as a  unicid
versal contains within itselfall its various moments and belongs 
to  them  but  again  is  also  indifferent  to  them  as  specific 
moments and is free and independent and as this free  simple 
ahstract  matter in  hand has  the value of essential  being  The 
various moments of the original determinateness or of the matcid
ter in hand of this  particular individual  the  moments  of his 
End  of the means  of the  action  itself  and  of the  reality  all 
these are on the one hand single  particular moments for  this 
consciousness which in comparison with the matter in hand 
it can abandon and surrender  On  the  other  hand  however 
they alJ  have this matter in hand as their essence but only in 
such a  way that it  being their abstract universal can be found 
in each of these various moments and can be a predzcate of them 
The matter in hand is  not yet  a  subject  but those  moments 
count as subject becuse they fall  on the side of indivdualityin 
general whereas the matter in hand is  at first  only the simple 
universal  It is  the genus  which is  found  in all  these  moments 
as species of itself  and is  equally free and independent of them 
   Consciousness is  cald honest  when  it  has  on  the  one 
hand  attained  to  the  idealism  which  the  matter  in  hand 
expresses  and on  the other  hand possesses  the  truth in  it qua 
this  formal  universality  a  consciousness  which  is  concerned 
solely with the matter in hand and thetefore busies itselfsolely 
with  the  various  moments  or species  of it  and  when it does 
not attain the matter in hand in one of these  moments or in 
one meaning it for that very reason gets  hold of it in another 
Consequently  it  does  in  fact  always  obtain  the  satisfaction 
which it should  enjoy in  virtue of its  Notion  Whichever  way 
things tUfn  out it  has  accomplished  and  attained  the matter 
in  hand  for  this  being  the  universal  genus  of those  moments 
is  the  predicate of them all 

 

  If this  consciousness  does  not convert its  purpose  into 
a  reality  it has  at least willed it ie  it makes the purpose qua 
purpose  the mere doing which does nothing the heart of the 
matter and  can  therefore  etplain  and  console  itself with  the 
fact that all the same something was  taken in hand and  done 

C  AA  REASON 

Since the universal itself contains subsumed under it the negacid
tive moment or the vanishing the fact that the work annihilates 
itself  this  too is  its doing  It has  incited  the others to do  this 
and in the vanishing of its reality still finds satisfaction just like 
naughty  boys  who  enjoy  themselves  when  they  get  their  ears 
boxed because they  are the cause of its  being done  Or again 
suppose it has not even attempted  to  carry out the matter in 
hand  and  has  done  absolutely  nothing  then it has  not  been 
able to the matter in hand is for it just the unity of its resolve 
and the reality it asserts that the reaity would be nothing else 
but what it was possible for it to do Finally suppose something 
of interest  to  him  has come his  way without any effort on his 
part then for him this reality is the matter in hand just because 
of the interest he finds  in it  even  though that reality has  not 
been produced by him  If it is  a piece of good fortune that has 
befallen him personally then he is sure that it is his own doing 
and his own desert if on the other hand it should be an event 
of historical importance which does not really concern him he 
makescitdikewise hisown and an interest for which he has done 
nothing  is  in  his  own  eyesa  party  interest  which  he  has 
favoured  or opposed  and  even combated or supported 

  The integrity of this consciousness as wen as the satisfaccid

tion it experiences in all its relationships obviously  consists in 
the fact  that it does not  bring  together its  thoughts  about  the 
matter in hand  For it  the  matter in  hand  is  as  much  its 
own affair as not a work at all or is a mere action and an empty 
purpose or even a  reality involving no action at all it makes 
one meaning after  another  the  subject  of this  predicate  and 
forgets  them one  after another  Now  the  matter in hand  in 
being merely willed or evenin being incapable of realization 
has the meaning of an empty purpose and of a  unity of wining 
and achievement only in thought The consolation for the failure 
of the purpose which at least was willed  or at least simply  done 
as well as  the satisfaction of having given others something to 
do  makes simple doing  or  thoroughly bad  work  the essence 
of the whole affair for  that work is  to  be called  bad which is 
no work at all Finally in the lucky event of finding the reality 
already in being  this  being  becomes  without any  effort  the 
matter in hand  itself 

  The truth about this integrity however is that it is  not 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

as  honest as  it seems  For it cannot be so  unthinking as  to let 
these various moments actually fall  apart in that way it must 
be directly aware otheir antithesis because they are absolutely 
interrelated The pure action is essentially the action of this parcid
ticular individual and this action is equally essentially a reality 
ora matter in hand Conversely the reality is  essentially only 
as his doing and as  action in general as  well  and his action is 
at the same time only as action in general and so  too as reality 
in general While then it seems to him that his concern is ony 
with the matter in hand as  an ahstract  reality  it is  also  a  fact 
that he is  concerned with it as  his own doing But just because 
he is  concerned  merely with  being active and  busy  he is  not 
really in earnest about it he has only to do with some objective 
matter and with one  that is  his  own  Since  finally  he  seems 
to will only his own affair or his own action it is again a  matter 
ofdealing with an affair in general or with a  reality that endures 
in its  own  right 

  Just  as  the  matter  in  hand  itself and  its  moments 
appear here as content  they are equally necessary  too  asfJrms 
in consciousness  They appear as content only to vanish  each 
making room for  the other They must therefore be present in 
the character of superseded forms but as such they are aspects 
of consciousness itself The matter in hand is present as the incid
itself or the reflection into itselfofconsciousness the supplantcid
ingofthe moments by one another finds expression there howcid
ever in their being established in consciousness not as they are 
in  themselves but only as  existing  for  another  consciousness 
One of the moments of the content is exposed by it to the light 
of day and made manifest to others but consciousness is at the 
same time reflected back from it into itself and  the opposite is 
equally present within consciousness  which  retains itfor itself 
as its own At the same time what occurs is not that one or other 
of the moments ismerely exposed and another merey retained 
on the contrary consciousness operates alternately with them 
for it must make one as well  as another essential for itself and 
for the others The whole is the spontaneous interfusion ofindivicid
duality and the universal but because this whole is  present for 
consciousness only as the simple essence and thus as the abstraccid
tion  of the  matter in  hand  its  separate  moments  faB  apart 
outside of that matter in hand and of one another As  a  whole 

C  AA  REASON 

it  is  only  exhaustively  exhibited  by  alternately  exposing  its 
moments and retaining them for itself Since in this alternation 
consciousness keeps in its reflection one moment for itself and 
as  essential  while  another is  only  externally  present in  it  or 
is for others  there thus enters a play of individualities with one 
another in which each and all find  themselves  both deceiving 
and deceived 

  An individuality sets about carrying out something by 
so doing it seems to have made something its own  affair  it acts 
and in acting becomes involved with others and seems to itself 
to  be  having  to  do with  reality  The others  therefore  take  its 
action for a  sign of its interest in the matter in hand as  such 
and its purpose to be the carryingout of the matter per  se  recid
gardless  whether  this  is  done  by  the  first  individuality  or  by 
them  Accordingly  when they point out that this  matter  has 
already been accomplished by them or if it has not offer and 
furnish  their assistance  then  this  consciousness  has  really  left 
the position they believe it to  occupy  it is  its own  action and 
its own effort thatconstitllteitsinterestin the matter in hand 
and whenthe othersbecomeawarethat this was really thematcid
ter inhand then they feel  theyhavebeen deceived  But actucid
ally their eagerness to come and help was itself nothing else but 
a desire  to  see  and  exhibit their  own action  not the matter in 
hand itself  that is  they wanted  to  deceive the others  in just 
the  same  way  that  they  complain  of having  been  deceived 
Since it now turns Ollt  that its own  action and eifort  the play 
of its own powers is  the heart of the matter it seems that concid
sciousness  is  occupied  with  its  own  interest  not  with  that  of 
others and is  anxious only about action as its own  action  not 
about action as  the action of others and hence seems  to allow 
the others to do as they like about the matter they have in hand 
But again they are mistaken that consciousness has already left 
the position they thought it occupied It is  not concerned with 
the matter in hand as  its own  particular affair  but simply as 
a matter in hand as a universal which is for everyone It intercid
feres  therefore in the action and work of others and if it can 
no  longer take  the  work  out of their  hands  it  at least shows 
an interest in it  by passing judgement on  it  if it gives  it  the 
stamp of its approval and praise  this  is  meant  to imply that 
in the work  it praises not only the work itself  but also  its own 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

  

generosity and  moderation in  not  having  damaged  the  work 
as work  nor damaged it by its censure  In showing an interest 
in the work it is  enjoying its  own self  and  the  work which it 
censures is equally welcome  to it for just this  enjoyment of its 
own  action which its  censure  provides  Those  however  who 
think or pretend to think that they have been deceived by this 
interference wanted really themselves to practise the same kind 
of deceit They pretend that their action and efforts are some 
thing for  themselves alon in which they have only themselves 
and  their  own  essential  nature  in  mind  However  in  doing 
something and  thus  bringing themselves  out into the light of 
day  they directly  contradict  by  their deed  their pretence  of 
wanting to exclude the glare of publicity and participation by 
alland sundry Actualization is  on the contrary  a  display of 
what  is  ones  own  in  the  element  of universality  whereby  it 
becomes  and should  become  the affair of everyone 

  It is  then equally a deception of oneself and of others 
if it is  pretended that what one is  concerned with is  the matter 
in  hand  alone  A  consciousness  that opens  up a  subjectmatter 
soon learns that others hurry along like flies  to freshly pouredcid
out milk and want to  busy themselves with it and they learn 
about that individual that he  too  is  concerned  with the sub 
jeetmatter not as  an object  but as his own  affair  On the other 
hand  if what is  supposed  to  be  essential  is  merely  the  doing 
of it  the employment of powers and capacities  or the  expres 
sion of this  particular individuality  then equally it is  learned 
by all  parties  that  they all  regard  themselves  as  affected  and 
invited to participate and instead ofa mere doing or separate 
action  peculiar to the individual who opened  up  the subjectcid
matter something has been opened up that is for others as well 
or is a subj eetma tter on its own account In both cases the same 
thing happens and only has a different significance by contrast 
with what was assumed and was supposed to be accepted Concid
sciousness experiences both sides as equally essential monlents 
and in doing so  learns what the nature of the matter in hand really 
is viz that it is neither merely something which stands opposed 
to action in general and to individual action nor action whieh 
stands opposed  to a  continuing being and which would  be the 
free  genus  of these  moments  as  its  species  Rather is  its  nature 
such  that its  being  is  the  action  of the  single  individual  and  of 

c  AA  REASON 

all  individuals  and  whose  action  is  immediately for  others  or 
is  a matter in hand  and is  such only as  the action of each  and 
everyone  the essence which is  the essence of all  beings  viz  spiricid
tual essence  Consciousness learns that no one of these  moments 
is subject but rather gets dissolved in the universal matter in hand 
the  moments  of the  individuality  which  this  unthinking  concid
sciousness regarded as subject one after the other coalesce into 
simple individuality which  as  this particular individuality  is 
no  less  immediately  universal  Thus  the  matter in  hand  no 
longer has the character of a predicate and  loses the charactercid
istic of lifeless abstract universality  It is  rather substance  percid
meated  by individuality suhject in which there is individuality 
just as  much qua individual or qua  thzs particular individual  as 
qua all individuals and it is the universal which has being only 
as  this action of all and each and  a  reality  in  the fct that  this 
particular consciousness knows it to be its own individual reality 
and the reality of aU  The pure matter in  hand itself is  what 
was  defined  above  as  the  category  being  that  is  the  or 
the I thatis being but in the form of thought which is stilJdistincid
guished  from  actual  selfconsciousness  Here  however 
the 
moments of actual selfconsciousness  in so  far  as  we  call  them 
its content  purpose action and reality and also  in so  far  as 
we callthem i tsform beingfor  self and being  for  another are 
posited as one with the simple category itself  and the category 
is  thereby  at the same  time  the entire  content 

b  Reason  as  lawgiver 

  Spiritual essence is in its simple being pure consciousness 
and this selfconsciousness  The originally determinate  nature of 
the individual has lost its positive meaning of being in  itself the 
element and the purpose ofits activity it is merely a superseded 
moment and the individual is  a selfin the form  of a  universal 
self  Conversely theformal matter in hand gets its filling from 
the active selfdifferentiating individuality for  the differences 
within  the  latter constitute  the  content  of that  universal  The 
category is  in itself or implicit as  the universal of pure consciouscid
ness it is eq ually for itself or explici t for the self of consciousness 
is  equally  a  moment  of it  It is  absolute  being  for  that  unicid
versality is  the simple selfidentity  of being 

  Thus  what  is  object  for  consciousness  has  the  signifi

canee of being the True it is and it is  authoritative  in the sense 
that it exists and is authoritative in and for itself I tis theahsolute 
matter in  hand  which no  longer  suffers  from  the  antithesis 
of certainty and  its  truth  between  universal  and  individual 
between purpose and its reality but whose existence is the reality 
and action ofself  consciousness This matter in hand is therefore 
the  ethical  substance  and  consciousness  of it is  the  ethical  concid
sciousness Its object is  likewise for it the True for it combines 
selfmconsciousness and  being in a single uni ty  I t  has  the value 
of the Absolute for sefaconsciousness cannot and does not want 
any more to go beyond this object for in it it is in communion 
with itself  it cannot  for  it is  all  being  and  all  power  it does 
not want  to  for it is  the self or the  wi I of this  self  The object 
is  in its own self real  as  object for it contains within itself the 
distinction characteristic of consciousness  it divides  itself into 
masses  Massen  or spheres  which  are  the  determinate  laws  of 
the absolute essence These masses  however  do not obscure 
the Notion  for  the moments of being and pure consciousness 
and of the self remain enclosed  within ita unity which con  
stitutes  the  essence  of these  masses and  which  in  this  dis  
tinction  no  longer  lets  these  moments  fall  apart  from  one 
another 

  These laws or masses of the ethical substance are imcid

mediately acknowledged  We  cannot ask for  their  origin  and 
justification norean we look for any other warrant for somecid
thing other than essence that is  in and for  itself could  only be 
seWconsciousness  itself  But  seWconsciousness  is  nothing  but 
this essence for His itself the beingfor selfofthis essence which 
is  the truth just because it is as much the self of consciousness 
as  it is  its initself or pure consciousness 

  Sinee selfconsciousness knows itself to  be a  moment of 
the heingforself of this substance  it expresses  the existence of 
the  law  within  itself as  follows  sound  Reason  knows  immecid
diatelywhat is  right and good Just as it knows the law immecid
diately  so  too  the law is valid  for it immediately  and it says 
directly this is right and good and moreover this particular 
law  The laws  are determinate  the  law is  the matter in  hand 
itself filled  with a  significant content 

  What  is  thus  given  immediately  must  likewise  be 
accepted  and  considered  immediately  Just  as  in  the  case  of 

C  AA  REASON 

 
sensecertainty we had to examine the nature of what it immecid
diately expressed as being  so  here  too  we have to see how the 
being expressed  by this immediate ethical certainty  or  by  the 
immediately existing masses  of the ethical substance  is  concid
stituted Examples of some such laws will show us this and since 
we  take them in the form of declarations of the sound  Reason 
which knows them lJe do not have first to introduce the moment 
which  has  to  be  made valid  in  them  considered  as  immediate 
ethical laws 

  Everyone  ought  to  speak  the  truth  In  this  duty  as 
expressed  unconditionally  the  condition  will  at  once  be 
admitted ifhe knows the truth The commandment then will 
now run everyone ought to speak the truth at all times accord 
ing to his knowledge and conviction Sound Reason this ethical 
Substance  precisely  which  knows  immediately  what is  right 
and good will also  explain  that this  condition was  already so 
much part and parcel of tha t uni versa maxim that this is  how 
it meant  that  commandment  to be  understood  But  with  this 
admission  it  in fact  admits  that  already  in  the  very  act  of 
saying the commandment it really violates it It said everyone 
ought to  speak  the  truth  but it meant he ought  to  speak  it 
according to his knowledge and conviction that is to say what 
it said was different from what it meant and to speakotherwise 
than one means  means  not  speaking  the  truth  The  untruth 
or inapt expression in its  improved form  now  runs  everyole 
ought to speak the truth according to his  knowledge  and  con 
viction at the time But with this correction  what the proposicid
tion wanted to enunciate as universally necessary and intrinsiccid
ally valid has really turned  round  into something completely 
contingent  For  speaking  the  truth  is  made  contingent  on 
whether I  can know it and can convince myself of it and  the 
proposition says  nothing more than that a  confused lUlJddle of 
truth and falsehood ought to be sPQkenjust as anyone happens 
to know mean and understand it This contingency of the concid
tent has  universality merely in  the propositional form  in  which 
it is  expressed  hut as  an ethical proposition it promises a  unicid
versal  and  necessary content  and  thus contradicts itself by the 
content being contingent Finally if the proposition were recticid
fied bysaying that the contingency of the knowledge and conviccid
tion of the truth ought to be dropped and that the truth ought 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

also  to  be  known  then  this  would  be  a  commandment  which 
directly contradicts the one we started from  Sound Reason was 
at first supposed to possess immediately the capacity to speak the 
truth  now  however  it is  said  that it ought  to  know  that  is  to 
say  that it does not immediately know what is  true  Looking  at 
this from the side of the content  then this  has  dropped  out in 
the demand  that we  should  know  the  truth  for  this  refers  to 
knowing in general we ough t to know What is demanded is there 
fore  really something free of all specific content  But here  the 
point in question was about a specific content a distinction in the 
ethical substance Yet this immediate determination of the subcid
stance is  a content which showed itself to be really completely 
contingent  and  which  when  raised  into  universality  and 
necessity by making the law refer to knowing  instead of to concid
tent  in fact  vanishes 

  Another  celebrated  commandment  is 

Love  thy 
neighbour as thyself I tis directed to the individual in his rela 
tionship with other individuals and asserts the  commandment 
as  a relationship between two individuals or as a  relationship 
of feeling  Actiy lovefor love that does not act has no  existcid
enceand is  thereforehargly intended hereaims at removing 
an evil from someone and being good  to him  For this purpose 
I have to distinguish what is bad for him what is  the appropricid
ate good  to  counter this  evil  and  what in general is  good  for 
him ie  I  must  love  him  intelligently  Unintelligent  love  will 
perhaps do him more harm than hatred Intelligent substantial 
beneficence is however in its richest and most important form 
the  intelligent  universal  action  of the  statean  action  comcid
pared with which the action ofa single individual as an indivicid
dual  is  so  insignificant that it is  hardly  worth  talking  about 
The action of the state is  moreover  of great a  power that 
if the action of the individual were to opposeit and either were 
intended to be a downright explicitly criminal act  or the incid
dividual out of love for someone else wanted  to  cheat the unicid
versal out of its right and its share in the action such an action 
would be altogether useless and inevitably frustrated The only 
significance left for bendicence  which is  a  sentiment  is  that of 
an action which is quite single and isolated of help in a situation 
of need which is as contingent as i tis transi tory Chance d etercid
mines  not only the occasion of the action  but also  whether it 

C  AA  REASON 

is  a  work  at  all  whether  it  is  not immediately undone  and 
even  perverted  into something  bad  Thus  this  acting  for  the 
good of others which is  said to be necessary  is of such kind  that 
it may or may not exist is such that ifby chance the occasion 
offers the action is  perhaps a  work and is good but also percid
haps not  This law  therefore  as  little has a  universal  content 
as the one we first considered and does not express as an absocid
lute ethical law should something that is valid in and for itself 
In other words  such  laws  stop short at Ought  they have  no 
actuality  they are not laws  but merely commandments 

  It is evident however from  the very nature of the case 
that we must give up all idea of a  universal  absolute content 
For any determinateness placed in the simple substance whose 
nature is to be simple is inadequate to it The commandment 
in  its  simple  absoluteness  itself expresses  an  mmediate  ethical 
being  the distinction appearing in it is  a  determinateness  and 
therefore a  content subsumed  under the absolute universality 
of this simple being Since then all idea of an absolute content 
must be given up  it can only  claim  a  formal  universality  or 
that it is  not seWcontradictory  For  universaHty  that  lacks  a 
content is merely formal and an absQlute contentitselfis tanta 
mount to  a  distinction which is  no distinction Le  to  absence 
of content 

  All that is left then for the making ofa law is  the mere 
form of universality or in fact  the talltology of consciousness 
which stands over against the content and the knowledge  not 
of an existing or a  real content  but only of the essence  or selfcid
identity of a  content 

  The ethical nature therefore is not itsefsimply as such 
a  content  but only a  standard for deciding whether a  content 
is capable of being a  law or not ie whether iris or is  not selfcid
contradictory  Reason  as  the  giver  of laws  is  reduced  to  a 
Reason  which merely  critically  examines  them 

c  Reason  as  testing  laws 

  A distinction within the simple ethical substance is  for 
it an accident which appeared as we sawin specific command 
ments  as  the  contingency of the  knowledge  of the  circumcid
stances  of the  circumstances  themselves  and  of the  action 
The comparison  of that simple  being  with  the  determinateness 

INDIVIDUALITY REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

corresponding  to  it was  made  by  us  and  in  that  comparison 
the simple substance has shown itself to be a formal universality 
or pure consciousness  which is  free  from  the content and stands 
over against it and is a  knowing of it as something determinate 
This universality in this way remains the same as what the mat
ter in hand itself was  ijut in consciousness it is something else 
it  is  namely  no  longer  the  unthinking  inert  genus  but  is 
related to the particular and regarded as the power over it and 
as its truth This consciousness seems at first to be the same pro 
cess of testing which formerly we  carried out and it seems that 
its action cannot beanything other than what has already hapcid
pened viz a comparison of the universal with the determinate 
particular which    previously  would  reveal  their disparity 
Here however the relationship of the content to  th  universal 
is different since the latter has acquired a different significance 
it isaormal universality of which  the  determinate  content is 
capable for in that universalitythe content is  considered only 
in relation  toitself  When we  were  testing  the  universal  pure 
substance  stoop  over  against  the  determinateness  which  discid
playeq  itselfasa contingency of the consciousness into  which 
the substance  eutered  Here  one term  of the  comparison  has 
vanished  theniversaLis  no longer the  affirmatively  present 
and authoritativesubstance  or that which is  right in and for 
itself  hut a  simple knowing or a form  which compares a  concid
tent only with itself  and  considers  whether  it  is  a  tautology 
Laws are no longer given buCtesled  and for  the consciousness 
which tests them they are already given It takes up their CfJntent 
simply as  it is  without  concerning  itself  as  we did  with  the 
particularity and contingency inherent in its reality it is  concid
cerned with the commandment simply as commandllent and 
its  attitde towards it is just  as  uncomplicated  as  is  its  being 
a  criterion for  testing  it 

  But tbat is the reason why this testing does  not get very 
far  Just  because the  criterion  is  a  tautology  and  indifferent 
to the coutentone content isjustas acceptable to it asitsoppocid
site  SlJPPose  the question is  Ought it  to  be  an  absolute  law 
that thcreshould  be  property Absolute  and  not on grounds 
of utility for  other ends  the  essence  of ethics  consists just in 
law  being  identical  with itself and  through  this  selfidentity 
ie  through  having  its  ground  in  itself  it  is  unconditioned 

C  AA  REASON 

Property simply as such does not contradict itself it is  an iso 
lated determinateness or is posited aa merely selfidentical Non 
property the nonownership of things or a common ownership 
of goods  is  just  as  little  selfcontradictory  That  something 
belongs  to  nobody  or to  the  firstcomer who  takes  possession 
ofit or to all together to each according to his need or in equal 
portionsthat isa simple determinateness aJormal thought like 
its  opposite  property  Admittedly  if a  thing  that  belongs  to 
no one is considered as a necessary object oJa need  then it is  necescid
sary that it become the property of some particular individual 
and  the contradiction would  stem  rather from  the freedom  of 
the thing being made into a  law  But by nonownership of the 
thing is  not  meant absolute  nonownership  but  that  it  shall 
come into someones  possession  according  to  the  individuals 
need  and  moreover  not in order to  be kept  but to  be  used 
immediately But to provide for the need in such a completely 
arbitrary way is  contradictory to  the  nature of the  conscious 
individual who alone is  under discvssion  For such an indivicid
dual must think of his need in the form of universality  must pro  
vide for the whole of his existence and acquire a lasting possescid
sion This being so  the idea ofa thing beiog arbitrarily allotted 
to the first s elf  cons do us individual who comes along anrlneeds 
it does not accord with itself  In a  sodetyhased on acornmon 
ownership of goods in which provision  would  be made in ac 
cordance  wi th  a  universal  fixed  rule  either  each  receives  as 
much  as  he  needsin  which  case  there  is  a  contradiction 
betweenthis inequality and  the  essential  nature  of that concid
sciousness whoseprincple is the equality ofindividualsor in 
accordance  with  that  principle  goods  will  he  equally  districid
buted  and  in  this  case  the  share  is  not  related  to  the need 
although such a  relationship alone constitutes  the very notion 
of sharing  

 I  Still ifin this way the notion of nonproperty appears 
contradictory this is only because it has notbeen left as a simple 
determinateness The same applies to the notion of  property 
if this is  resolved into its moments The single thingthat is my 
property is held as such to be something universal Solidly estah 
lished  and permanent  but this  contradicts its  nature  which 
consists in its  being  used  and  in  vanishing  At  the  same  time 
itisheld to be mine something which everyone else acknowledges 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

 

and  lets  alone  The fact  however  that  I  am  acknowledged 
implies rather  my  equality  my identity  with  everyone  and 
that is the opposite of exclusiveness  What I possess is a Thing 
ie something which is for  others in  general and is  only for  me 
in a quite general undefined way that  possess it contradicts 
its universal thinghood Consequently property isjust as much 
an  allround  contradiction  as  nonproperty  each  contains 
within it these  two opposed selfcontradictory moments of incid
dividuality  and  universality  But  each  of  these  determinacid
tenesses when thought of as simple as property or nonproperty 
without explicating them further is  as  simple  as  the other ie 
is not selfcontradictory The criterion oflaw which Reason poscid
sesses  within itself fits  every  case  equally well  and  is  thus  in 
fact  no criterion at all  It would  be strange  too  if tautology 
the  maxim  of contradiction  which  is  admitted  to  be  only  a 
formal criterion for the cognition of theoretical truth ie somecid
thing  which is  quite  indifferent  to  truth  and  falsehood  were 
supposed  to  be  more  than  this  for  the  cognition  of practical 
truth 

  In  both  the  above  moments  which  fill  the  former 
emptiness of spiri tual being  the process of placing immediate 
determinatenessesin the ethical su bstance and then getting to 
know whether they are laws  has  been eliminated The result 
thereforeseems to be that neither specific laws nor a knowledge 
of them is  admissible  But  the  substance  is  the  consciousness  of 
itself as  absolutely essential  beiIg  which  therefore  can  give 
up neither the distinction  within it nor the knowledge of that discid
tinction That law  giving and the  testing  of laws  have proved 
to be futile means that both when taken singly and in isolation 
are merely unstable moments of the ethical consciousness  and 
the  movement in which  they appear has the formal  meaning 
that the ethical subs tance thereby exhibits itself as consciousness 

  In so far as  these two moments are more precise detercid

minations of consciousness  of the  matter  in  hand  they  can  be 
regarded as  forms  of the honest  consciousness  which  as  previcid
ously in the case of its formal moments  now  busies itself with 
a supposed content of the good and the right  and with testing 
such established  truth  and fancies  that in sound  Reason  and 
intelligent insight it possesses that which gi ves force and validity 
to commandments 

C  AA  REASON 

  However  without  this  honesty  laws  do  not  have 
validity as the essence  of consciousness  nor  similarly does  the 
testing of them count as an action within consciousness  On the 
contrary  these  moments  appearing each  by itself immediately 
as  a  reality  express in the one case an invalid  establishing and 
existence of actual laws and in the other case an equally invalid 
immunity from  them The law as a  specific law  has a  contincid
gent content this  means here that it is  the law of a single concid
sciousness  and  has  an  arbitrary  content  To  legislate  immecid
diately in that way is thus the tyrannical insolence which makes 
caprice into a law and ethical behaviour into obedience to such 
capriceobedience to  laws  which  are  merely  laws  and  not  at 
the same time  commandments  So  too  the  second  moment  in 
so far as  it is  isolated  means testing  the  laws  moving  the imcid
movable  means  the  insolence  of a  knowledge  which  argues 
itself into a  freedom  from  absolute  laws  treating  them  as  an 
alien  caprice 

  In  both forms  these  moments are a  negative  relation 
to substance or real spiritual being or we may say that in them 
substancecioesnot as yet possess its reality but rather that concid
sdousnesscontains them still in the form of its own immediacy 
and that substance is at first only a willing and knowing by this 
particular individual  or the  ought to  be  of an  unreal  comcid
mandment and a  knowledge  offormal universality  But since 
these modes have been supersededconsciousness has returned 
intothe universal and those antitheses have vanished Spiritual 
being is actual substance through these modes being valid  not 
in isolation  but only as superseded  moments  and  the  unity 
in which they are  merely moments is  the self of consciousness 
which being from now on posited in the spiritual being  makes 
that being actual fullfilled  and  seWconscious 

  The spiritual  being  thus exists  first  of all  for  selfcon 
sciousness as law which has an intrinsic  being  the  universality 
associated with testing the law a merely formal nolan essential 
universality  is  now  behind  us  The law is  equally  an  eternal 
law which is grounded not in the will of a particular individual 
but is  valid  in and  for  itself  it is  the  absolute pure  will  of all 
which has  the form  of immediate  being  AJso  it is  not a  comcid
mandment which only ought to be it is  and is  valid it is  the unicid
versal I of the category the I which is immediately a reality 

INDIVIDUALITY  REAL  IN  AND  FOR  ITSELF 

r 
and  the  world  is  only this  reality  But  since  this  existent  law 
is  valid  unconditionally  the obedience of seJfconsciousness is 
not  the serving of a  master whose  commands  were  arbitrary 
and in  which  it  would  not recognize  itself  On  the  contrary 
laws  are  the  thoughts  of  its  own  absolute  consciousness 
thoughts which are immediately its own Also it does not believe 
in  them  for  although  belief  does  perceive  essential  being 
it perceives  it as  something  alien  to  itself  Ethical  selfcon 
sciousness  is  tmmediately  one  with  essential  being  through  the 
universality  of its sell  belief  on the other hand  starts from  the 
individual consciousness it is the movement of that consciousness 
always towards this unity but without attaining to the presence 
of its  essential  being  The  above  consciousness  on  the  other 
hand has put its merely individual aspect behind it this media 
tion is finished and complete and only because this is so  is  this 
consciousness immediate selfconsciousness of the  ethical  sub

  The difference between selfconsciousness and essence 
is  therefore  perfectly  transparent  Because  of this  the  dis 
tinctions in essence itself are not accidental determinatenesses 
on  the contrary in virtue of the  unity of essence and  selfcon 
sciousness  this  latter  being  the  only  possible  source  of  dis

parent to themselves stainless celestial figures  that preserve in 
aU  their differences  the  undefiled  innocence  and  harmony of 
their  essential  nature  The  relationship  of selfconsciousness  to 
them is equally simple and clear They are  and nothing mpre 
this is what constitutes the awareness of its relationship to them 
Thus Sophocles Antigone acknowledges them as the unwritten 
and infallible law of the gods 

They are not of yesterday or today but everlasting 
Though where  they came from  none of us  can tell 

They are  If I  inquire  after  their  origin  and  confine  them  to 
the  point whence  they arose  then  I  have  transcended  them 
for now it is I who am the universal and they are the conditioned 
and limited If they are supposed to be validated by my insight 
then I  have already denied  their unshakeable intrinsic  being

and regard them as something which for  me  is  perhaps  true 
but also is  perhaps not true  Ethical disposition consists just in 
sticking steadfastly  to  what is  right  and  abstaining  from  all 
attempts to move or shake it  or derive it  Suppose something 
has  been  entrusted  to  me  it  is  the  property of someone  else 
and  I  acknowledge this  because  it is  so  and  I  keep  myself uncid
falteringly in this relationship If I should keep for myself what 
is  entrusted to me  then according  to  the principle I  follow  in 
testing laws which is  a  tautology  I  am not in  the least guilty 
of contradiction  for then I  no longer look upon it as  the propcid
erty of someone else  to  hold  on  to something which  I  do not 
regard  as  belonging  to  someone  else  is  perfectly  consistent 
Alteration of the point of view is  not contradiction for  what we 
are concerned with is not the point of view  but the object and 
content  which  ought  not  to  be  selfcontradictory  Just  as  I 
canas I do when I give something awayalter the view that 
it is  my property into the view that it belongs to someone else 
without becoming guilty of a  contradiction  so  I  can  equally 
pursue  the reverse  course  It is  not  therefore  because  I  find 
something is not selfcontradictory that it is  right on the  concid
trary iLis  right because it is  what is  right  That something is 
the propertyofanother this is fundamental I have not to argue 
about it or hun t around for or en tertain thoughts connections 
aspects ofvarious kinds I  have to think neither of making laws 
nor of testing them All such thinking on my part would upset 
that relation since if I  liked  I  could  in fact just as well  make 
the opposite conform  to  my indeterminate tautological knowcid
ledge and make that  the law  But  whether this  or the opposite 
determination is  the right  that is determined in  and Jor  itself 
I  could  make whichever of them  I  liked  the  law  and just  as 
well neither of them and as soon as  I  start to test them I  have 
already begun  to  tread  an  unethical path  By  acknowledging 
the absoluteness of the right  I  am within the  ethical substance 
and  this  substance is  thus  the essence  of selfconsciousness  But 
this  selfconsciousness  is  the  actuality  and  existence  of the  su bcid
stance  its self and its  will 

BB  SPIRIT 

VI  SPIRIT 

  Reason is  Spirit when its  certainty of being all  reality 
has  been raised  to truth and it is  cQDscious  of itself as  its  own 
world  and of the  world  as  itself  The  comingtobe  of Spirit 
was  indicated  in  the  immediately  preceding  movement  in 
which  the  object  of consciousness  the  pure  category  rose  to 
be the Notion of Reason In Reason as observer this pure unity of 
the I and being ofbeingjor itself and being in itself is determined 
as the initself or as  being  and the consciousness of Reason finds 
itself But thetruth of observation is rather that it leaves behind 
it thisiUlJnediate instinct which merely find  Reason  this uncid
conscious  existence  of Reason  The  intuited  category  the found 
Thing  enters conspjOllsnessas the beingforself of the I which 
is now aware ofitselfas the selfin objective being But this detercid
mination  of the  category  of beingforself opposed  to  beingcid
initself is  equaUy one  sided  and is  a  moment  that supersedes 
itself  The category is  therefore determined  for  conscousness 
as it is  in its universal truth as  a  being that is  in  and for  itself 
This still  abstract determination which constitutes  the  matter 
in hand itselfis at first only spiritual essence and its consciouscid
ness  only  a formallcnowing of it  which  busies itself with  all 
kinds of content qfthe essence This consciousness asapttrticucid
lar  individual  is  still  in  fact  distinct  from  substance  and 
eithr makes  arbitrary laws  or  fancies  that  in  simply  knowcid
ing  laws  it  possesses  them in  their own  absolute  nature  Or 
looked ttJrom the side of su bstance this is spiritual essence that 
is in and for itself but which is  not yetconscioumess of Itself  But 
essence  that is  in  apdfor itself  and which is  at the Same  time 
actual as  consciousness and aware pf itself  this is  Spirit 

  Its spiritual essence hts already been designated as  ethicid
cal substance  but Spirit is  the  actuality  of that substance  It is 
the  self of actual consciousness  to which  it stands opposed or 
rathef yhich it opposes  to  itself as  an objective  actual  world 
but awrld which has completely lost the meaning for  the self 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

of something alien  to it just as  the self has  completely lost  the 
meaning of a  beingforself separated from  the world  whether 
dependent on it or not  Spirit being the substance and  the  unicid
versal selfidentical and abiding essence is  the unmoved solid 
ground and startingpoint for  the action of all  and it is  their purcid
pose and goal the ini tself of every selfconsciousness expressed 
in  thought  This substance is  equally  the  universal  work  procid
duced by the action of all and each as  their unity and identity 
for  it is  the  beingforself  the self  action  As  substance  Spirit is 
unshaken righteous selfidentity but asbeingforselfit is a fragcid
mented  being  selfsacrificing  and  benevolent  in  which  each 
accomplishes his own work rends asunder the universal being 
and takes  from  it his  own share  This resolving of the essence 
into individuals is  precisely  the  moment  ofthe  action  and  the 
self of all  it is  the rnovement  and  soul  of substance  and  the 
resultant  universal  being  Just  because  it  is  a  being  that  is 
resolved  in  the self  it is  nota dead  essence  but is  actual  and 
alive 

  Spirit is  thus selfs up porting   absolute  real  being  All 
previous shapes of consciousness are abstract forms of it  They 
result from  Spirit analysing itself  distinghishing its  moments 
and  dwelling  for  a  while  with  each  This  isolating  of those 
moments presupposes  Spirit itselfand subsists  therein in  other 
words  he isolation exists onlyinSpiritwbich is a  concreteexcid
istence  In  this  isolation  thy have  the  appearance  of really 
existing as such  but that they are only moments or vanishing 
quantities  is  shown  by  their  advanceandretreat  into  their 
ground and essence and this essence isj ust this movement and 
resolution of these moments Here where Spirit or Spirits re  
flection  into itself is  posited  we  may briefly recall  this  aspect 
of them  in  our own  reflection  they  were  consciousness  selfcid
consciousness  and  Reason  Spirit  then  is  consciousness  in 
general  which  embraces  sensecertainty  perception  and  the 
Understanding in so far as  in its selfanalysis Spirit holds fast 
to the moment of being an objectively existent actuality to itself 
and ignores the fact  that this actuality is  its  ownbeingforself 
If  on  the  contrary  it  hoJds  fast  to  the  other moment  of the 
analysis  viz  that  its  object  is  its  own  heingJOr  self  then  it is 
selfconsciousness But as immediate consciousness of the being 
that is  in  and Jor  itself  as  unity  of consciousness  and  selfcon  

SPIRIT 

sciousness Spirit is consciousness that has Reason  it is consciouscid
ness which as the word has indicates has the object in a shape 
which is implicitly determined by Reason or by the value of the 
category  but  in  such  a  way  that  it  does  not  as  yet  have  for 
consciousness the value of the category Spirit is  that consciouscid
ness  which  we  were  considering  immediately  prior  to  the 
present stage Finally when  this Reason which Spirit has is incid
tuited by Spirit as Reason that exists or as  Reason that is  actual 
in  Spirit  and  is  its  world  then  Spirit  exists  in  its  truth  it is 
Spirit  the ethical  essence  that has  an actual  existence 

  Spirit is  the ethical  life  of a  nation in so  far  as  it is  the 
immediate truththe individual that is a world  It must advance 
to  the  consciousness  of what  it  is  immediately  must  leave 
behind it the  beauty of ethical life  and  by passing  through a 
series  of shapes attain  to  a  knowledge  of itself  These  shapes 
however are distinguished from  the previous ones  by  the fact 
that they are real  Spirits  actualities  in  the strict  meaning of 
the word and instead of being shapes merely of consciousness 
are shapes of a  world 

  The living ethical world is Spirit in its truth  When Spirit 
first  arrives at an abstract knowledge of its essence  ethical life 
is submerged in theformal universalityaflegaHty or law Spirit 
whichhenceforthis divided within itsel traces one afits worlds 
the realm oj culture  in the harsh reality of its objective element 
over againstthis realm it traces in the element of thought the 
world of heliif or faith  the  realm  of essential  being  Both  worlds 
however when grasped by Spiritwhich after this loss of itself 
withdraws  into  itselfwhen  grasped  by the  Notion  are  concid
founded  and revolutionized  by  the  insight  of the  individual 
and the diffusion of that insight known as  the Enlightenment 
and the realm which was divided and expanded into this world 
and  the  heyond  returns  into selfconsciousness  which  now  in 
theform ofmorality grasps itself as the essentiality and essence 
as the actual self it no longer places its world and its ground outcid
side ofitself but letseverythingfadeinto itself and as conscience 
is  Spirit that is  certain of itsef 

  The ethical world the world which is rent asunder into 
this  world  and  a  beyond  and  the  moral  view  of the  world 
are  thus  the Spirits  whose  process  and  return  into  the  simple 
selfconsciousness of Spirit are now  to  be developed  The goal 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

and outcome of that  process  will  appear  on  the  scene  as  the 
actual selfconsciousness  of absolute Spirit 

A  THE  TRUE  SPIRIT  THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

  Spirit is  in its  simple  truth  consciousness  and  forces 
its  moments  apart  Action  divides  it into  substance  and  concid
sciousness  of the substance  and divides  the substance as  well 
as  consciousness  Sbstance as  the universal essence and End 
stands over against the individualized reality the infinite middle 
term is selfconsciousness which being the implicit unity of itself 
and substance now  becomes  that  unity  explicitly  and  unites 
the universal essence and its individualized  reality  The latter 
it  raises  to  the  former  and  acts  ethically  the  former  it  brings 
down  to  the latter and realizes  the  End  the substance  which 
had an existence  only in thought  It brings into existence  the 
unity of its self and substance as  its  own  work  and  thus as  an 
actual existence 

  In this separation of the moments of consciousness  the 
simple suhstancehas on the one hand preserved the antithesis 
to selfconsciousness  and  on  the other  it  eq uallyexhibits in 
its own self the nature of consciousness viz to create distinctions 
within  itself  exhibiting  itself as  a  world  articulated  into its 
separate  spheres  It thus splits  itself up  into  distinct  ethical 
substances into a  human and a  divine law  Similarly the selfcid
consciousness confronting the substance assigns to itself accordcid
ing to its  nature one of these  powers  and as  a  knowing  is on 
the one hand ignorant of what it does  and on the other knows 
what it does a  knowledge which for that reason is a  deceptive 
knowledge  It learns  through its  own act the contradiction of 
those powers into which the substance divided  itself and  their 
mutual downfall as well as the contradiction between its knowcid
ledge  of the ethical  character of its  action  and  what is  in  its 
own proper nature ethical and thus finds  its own downfall  In 
point  of fact  however  the  ethical  substance  has  developed 
through  this  process  into  actual  selfconsciousness  in  other 
words  this particular self has  become the  actuality of what it 
is in essence but precisely in this development the ethical order 
has  been  destroyed 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

a  The  ethical world  Human  and Divine Law  Man  and  Woman 

  The  simple  substance  of Spirit  as  consciousness  is 
divided  In other words just  as  the  consciousness  of abstract 
sensuous being passes over into perception so also does the imcid
mediate certain ty of a real ethical si tua tion  and j us t as for sensecid
perception simple being becomes a Thing of many properties 
so  for  ethical perception a  given action is  an  actual  situation 
with  many ethical connections  For the former  however  the 
superfluous  plurality of properties  concentrates  itself into  the 
essential antithesis of individuality and  universality  and  still 
more for  ethical perception  which is  the  purified  substantial 
consciousness does the plurality of ethical moments become the 
duality of a  law of individuality and a  law of universality  But 
each ofthese divisions of substance remains Spirit in its entirety 
if in senseperception things have no other substance  than  the 
two determinations of individuality and universality here these 
determinations express only the superficial antithesis of the two 
sides 

  In  the  essence  we  are  considering  here  individuality 

has the meaning of selfconsciousness in general not of a particucid
lar contingent consciousness In this determination  therefore 
theethical substance is actual substance absolute Spirit realized 
in the plurality of eistent consdousnesses this spirit is the comcid
munity which  when  we  entered  the  sphere  of Reason  in  its 
practical embodiment wasjor us absolute essence and here has 
emerged on its own account in its truth as conscious ethical essence 
and as essence jor the  consciousness  which  here is  our  object 
It is Spirit which isjor tseljin that it preserves itsefin its refleccid
tion in individuals  and it is  implicitly  Spirit  or  substance  in 
that it  preserves  them  within  itself  As  actual  substance  it  is  a 
nation as actual consciousness itis the citizens of that nation This 
consciousness has its essence in simple Spirit and  the certainty 
of itself in the actuality of this Spirit  in  the  nation as  a  whole 
it has its  truth  therefore  not in something that is  not actual 
but in a  Spirit that exists  and  prevails 

  This Spirit can be called  the human  law  because it is 
essentially in the form  of a reality that is  conscious of itself  In 
the form  of universality it is  the known  law  and  the prevailing 
custom  in the form  of individuality it is  the  actual  certainty 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

of itself in  the individual as  such  and  the  certainty of itself as 
a  simple individuality is  that  Spirit  as  government  Its  truth 
is  the authority which is  openly accepted  and  manifest  to  all 
a concrete existence which appears for immediate certainty in the 
form  an  existence  that has  freely  issued  forth 

  Confronting  this  clearly  manifest  ethical  power  there 
is  however  another power  the  Divine  Law  For  the  ethical 
power of the state being the movement ofseIfconscious action 
finds its antithesis in  the simple and immediate essence  of the 
ethical sphere as actual universality it is a force actively opposed 
to individual beingforself  and as  actuality in general it finds 
in that inner essence something other than the ethical power of 
the state 

  It has already been  mentioned  that each  of the oppocid
sites  in  which  the  ethical  substance  exists  contains  the  entire 
substance and all the moments ofits content If  then the comcid
munity is that substance conscious of what it actually does  the 
other side  has  the  form  of immediate  substance  or substance 
that simply  is  The  latter is  thus  on  the  one  hand  the  inner 
Notion  or general  possibility of the  ethical sphezre  in  general 
but on the other hand  equally contains within it the  motnent 
of selfconsciousness This moment which expresses the ethical 
sphere in this element ofimmediacy or simple  being or which 
is an immediate consciousness ofitself  both as essence and as  this 
particular  self  in  an  other  ie  as  a  natural  ethical  comcid
munitythis is the Family The Family as  the unconscious  still 
inner Notion of the ethical order stands opposed to its actual 
selfconscious existence as the element of the nations actual excid
istence  it stands opposed  to  the nation itself  as  the immediate 
being  of the  ethical  order  it stands  over  against  that  order 
which shapes and maintains itself by working for the universal 
the  Penates stand  opposed  to  the  universal  Spirit 

 I  However  although  the  Family  is  immediately  detercid

mined as an ethical being it is within itselfan ethical entity only 
so far as it is  not the natural relationship of its  members  or so 
far  as  their connection is  an  immedialeconnection  of separate 
actual individuals for the ethical principle is  intrinsically unicid
versal  and  this natural relationship isjust as  much a  spiritual 
one  and it is  only  as  a  spiritual  entity  that  it  is  ethical  We 
have  to see  what constitutes its  peculiar ethical  character  In 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

the first place because the ethical principle is  intrinsically uni  
versal  the  ethical  connection  between  the  members  of  the 
Family is not that offeeting or the relationship of lave It seems 
then  that the ethical principle must  be placed in  the relation 
of the  individual  member of the Family to  the whole  Family as 
the Substance so that the End and content of what he does and 
actually is is solely the Family But the conscious End motivatcid
ing the action of this whole so far as  it is directed towards that 
whole is itself the individua The acquisition and maintenance 
of power and wealth i in part concerned only with needs and 
belongs to the sphere of appetite in part they become in their 
higher determination something that is only mediated This decid
termination does not fall  within the Family itself  but bears on 
what is  truly universal  the community it has rather a negacid
tive relation tothe Family and consists in expeling  the indivicid
dual  from  the  Family  subduing  the  natural  aspect  and 
separateness of his existence and  training him  to  be virtuous 
to a  Bfe in and for  the universal  The positive  End peculiar to 
the  Family is  the individual as  such  Now  in  order  that  this 
relationship be ethical neither he who performs the action nor 
heto whom the action refers can be in an accidental relationship 
as happens perhaps in rendering some assistance or service in 
aparticular case The cntentofthe ethical action must be sub  
stantial or whe and universal therefore it can only berelated 
to the whole individual or to  the individual qua  universal  And 
this again must not be understood  as  if it were only imagined 
that doing him  a  service  would  promote  his  total  happiness 
whereas the service being an immediate and actual deedprocid
duces only a  particular  effect  on  him  Nor  must  we  imagine 
that service in the fortn of education  ie  in a series  of efforts 
really has him  in his  entirety for  object and produces him as 
a  work for  apart from  the purpose which is  negatively  concid
nected with the Family the actual deed has only a limited concid
tent  Finally just as little should we  understand  the service  as 
a help in time of need  by which  in  truth the individual in his 
entirety is rescued for such help is itsefa completey contingent 
act the occasion of which is an ordinary reality which canei ther 
be or not be The deed then which embraces the entire existcid
ence of the boodrelation does not concern the citizen for  he 
does  not  belong  to  the  Family  nor  the  individual  who  is  to 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
become a citizen and  will cease  to  count  as  this  particular incid
dividual it has as  its object and content this particular indivicid
dual who belongs to the Family but is taken as a universal being 
freed  from  his  sensuous  ie  individual  reality  The deed  no 
longer concerns  the  living  but  the  dead  the  individual  who 
after a longsuccession of separate disconnected experiences concid
centrates himselfinto a single completed shape and has raised 
himself out of the  unrest of the  accidents of life  into the  calm 
of simpJe  universality  But  because it is  only as  a  citizen  that 
he is  actual and substantial the individual  so  far as  he is  not 
a citizen but belongs to the Family is only an unreal impotent 
shadow 

  This  universality  which  the  individual  as  such  attains 

isJure  being  death  it is  a  state  which  has  been  reached  immecid
diately  in  the  course  of Nature  not  the  result  of an  action  concid
scously  done  The duty of the  member  of a  Family is  on  that 
account to  add  this aspect  in order that the individuals ulticid
mate being  too  shaH  not  belong solely to  Nature and remain 
something irrational butshallhesomething done  andthe right 
of consciousness  be  asserted  in  it  Or rather  the  meaning of 
the action is  that  because  in  truth  the  calmand  universality 
of a selfconscious  being do  not belong  to  Nature  the illusory 
appearance that the death of the individual results from a eoncid
scious  action on  the part of Nature may be  dispelled  and  the 
truth  established  What  Nature  did  in  the  individual  is  that 
aspect in which  his  development into a  universal  is  exhibited 
as  the  movement of an  immediate  existent  This movement 
falls  it is  true  within the ethical community  and  has  this  for 
its  End  death  is  the  fulfilment  and  the  supreme  work 
which  the individual as  such  undertakes on its  behalf  But in 
so far as he is essentially a particular individual it is an accident 
that his  death was directly  connected  with  his  work  for  the 
universal and  was the result of it  partly because if his  death 
was such a  result it is  the  natural negativity and  movement of 
the individual as a  mere existent in which consciousness does 
not return into itself and  become selfconsciousness  or partly 
because  since  the movement of what  merely  exists  consists 
in its  being  superseded  and  becoming  a  beingforself  death 
is  the side  of diremption  in  which  the  attained  being  forsef 
is  something  other  than  the  mere  existent  which  began  the 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

movement  Because the ethical order is  Spirit in its  immediate 
truth  the sides into which its  consciousness  sunders itself also 
fall  into this form  of immediacy  and  individuality  passes  over 
into this abstract  negativity which  being in  its  own  self without 
consolation  and  reconciliation  must  receive  them  essentially 
through a real and external act  Bloodrelationship supplements 
then the abstract natural process by adding to it the movement 
of consciousness interrupting the work of Nature and rescuing 
the bloodrelation from destruction or better because destruccid
tion  is  necessary  the  passage  of the  bloodrelation  into  mere 
being  it takes   itself the act of destruction  Through this  it 
comes about that the dead  the universal being  becomes a  being 
that has returned into itself  a  beingfarself  or  the powerless 
simply isolated individual has been raised to universal individucid
ality  The dead individual  by having liberated  his  being  from 
his  action  or his  negative  unity  is  an  empty  singular  merely 
a  passive  beingforanother  at  the  mercy  of  every  lower 
irrational individuality and the forces of abstract material elecid
ments  all  of which are  now more powerful  than himself  the 
fOTITIer on accountof the life they possess  the latter on account 
ofthelr negative nature The Family keeps away from thedead 
this dishonouringofhim by unconscious appetites and abstract 
entities and puts its  own action in  their place  and  weds  the 
bloodrelation  to  the  bosom  of the  earth  to  the  elemental 
imperishahle individuality  The Family thereby makes  him a 
member ofa community which prevails over and holds  under 
control the forces of particular material elements and the lower 
forms  of life  which  sought to unloose  themselves against him 
and  to destroy him 

  This lstduty thus constitutes the perfect divine law or 
thepositive ethical  action  towards  the individual  Every other 
relationship to him which does not remain one simply of love 
but is  ethical belongs to human law and has the negative sigcid
nificance of raising the individual above his confinement within 
the natural community to  which  he in his  natural  existence 
belongs   Now  although  human  right  has  for  its  content  and 
power the  actual  ethical  substance  that  is  conscious  of itself 
ie  the entire nation while  the divine  right and  law  has for its 
content and power the individual who is beyond the real world 
yet  he  is  not  without  power  His  power  is  the  abstract  pure

  Now in the one law as in the other there are also  dif 
ferencesand gradations For since bothJaws have within them

their own  way  of life  break  loose  from  the  whole  and  strive 
after  the inviolable  independence  and  security  of the  person 
are made to feel in the task laid on them their lord and master 
death Spirit by thus  throwing into the meltingpot the stable 
existence of these  systems  checks  their  tendency  to  fall  away 
from  the  ethical  order  and  to  be  submerged  in  a  merely 
natural existence and it preserves and raises conscious self into 
freedom and its own  power  The negative essence shows  itself 
to be the real power of the community and the force  of its self 
preservation The community therefore possesses the truth and 
the confirmation of its  power in the essence of the Divine Law 
and in the realm of the  nether world 

  The Divine Law which governs the family  has likewise 
on its side differences within itselfwhose interrelationships con 
stitute the living process  of its  actuality  But among the three 
relationships  of  husband  and  wife  parents  and  children 
brothers and sisters  the relationship of husband and wife is  in 
thefirstplace the one in which one consciousness immediately 
recognizes  itself in another and  in  which  there  is  knowledge 
of this  mutual  recognition  Because  this  selfrecognition  is  a 
natural and not an ethical one  it is  only a  representation an 
image of Spirit not actually Spirit itself  A  representation  or 
image  however  has  its  actual  existence  in  something  other 
than itself  This relationship  therefore  has  its actual existence 
not in  itself but in  the  childan  other whose  cominginto 
existence is the relationship and is  also  that in which the relacid
tionship  itself gradually  passes  away  and  this  alternation  of 
successive generations has its enduring basis in the nation The 
dutiful reverence  of husband  and  wife  towards  each  other is 
thus  mixed with a  natural relation and with  feeling  and  the 
returnintoself of the relationship does  not  take  place within 
the  relationship itself similarly with  the  second  rda tionship 
the  dutiful  reverence  of  parents  and  children  towards  one 
another That of parents towards  their children is  emotionally 
affected by the fact that the objective reality of the relationship 
does not exist in them but in the children and by their witness  
ing the development in the children of an independent existence 
which they are unable totake back again the independent excid
istence of the children remains an alien  reality  a  reality all its 
own That of children towards parents is  emotionally affected 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
conversely by the fact that they derive their existence from  or 
have their essential being in what is other than themselves and 
passes  away  and  by  their  attaining  independenc  and  a 
selfconsciousness  of their own  only  by  being separated  from 
their sourcea separation in which  the source  dries  up 

  Both these relationships are confined within the transicid
tion and the disparity of the sides which are assigned  to  them 
The relationship in its unmixed form is found however in that 
between brother and sister They are the same blood which has 
however  in  them  reached  a  state  of rest  and  equilibrium 
Therefore they do not desire one another nor have they given 
to  or received from  one another this  independent beingforcid
self on the contrary  they are free  individualities  in  regard  to 
each  other  Consequently  the  feminine  in  the  form  of  the 
sister has the highest intuitive awareness of what is  ethicaL  She 
does not attain to consciousness of it or to  the objective existence 
of it because the law of the Family is an implicit inner essence 
which  is  not  exposed  to  the  daylight  of consciousness  but 
rellainsan inner feelingandthedivine element that is  exempt 
from an existence in  die  real  world  The woman is  associated 
with these household gods PenatesJand beholds in them both 
her universal substance  and  her  particular individuality  yet 
in such a  way  that  this  relation of her individuality  to  them 
is at the same time not the natural oneofdesire As a daughter 
the woman mustnow see her parents pass away with a natural 
emotion and ethical resignation for it is  only at the cost of this 
relationship that she  can achieve  that existence of her own  of 
which she is  capable  Thus in the parents she does nothehold 
her own beingforself in a  positive  form  The relationships  of 
mother and wife however are those of particular individuals 
partly in  the  form  of something  natural  pertaining  to  desire 
pardy in the  form  of something  negative  which sees  in  those 
relationships  only something  evanescent  and  also  again  the 
particular individ ual  is  for  that very reason  a  contingent  ee
ment which can be replaced by another individual In theethi 
cal household  it is  not a  question  of this  particular  husband 
this particular child but simply of husband and children genercid
ally the relationships of the woman are based not on feeling 
but on  the  universal  The  difference  between  the  ethical  life 
of the woman and that of the man consists just in  this  that in 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

 
her vocation as  an individual and in her pleasure  her interest 
is centred on the universal and remains alien to the particularity 
of desire whereas in the husband these two sides are separated 
and since  he  possesses  as  a  citizen  the selfconscious  power  of 
universality he thereby acquires the right of desire and at the 
same  time  preserves  his  freedom in regard  to it  Since  then 
in this relationship of the wife there is an admixture of particucid
larity her ethical life is  not pure  but in  so  far  as  it is  ethical 
the particularity is a matter ofindifference and the wife is withcid
ou t the moment of knowing herself as  this  particular self in the 
other partner The brother however is  for the sister a passive 
similar being in general the recognition of hers elfin him is pure 
and  unmixed  with  any  natural  desire  In  this  relationship 
therefore  the indifference of the particularity and the  ethical 
contingency of the latter are  not present but the  moment of 
the individual self recognizing and being recognized can here 
assert its  right  because  it is  linked  to  the  equilibrium  of the 
blood and is a relation devoid of desire  The loss  of the brother 
is  therefore irreparable to the sister and her duty towards  him 
is  the highest l 

  This relationship is at the same time the limit at which 
the selfcontained ifeof the Family breaks up and goes beyond 
itself  The brother is  the  member  of the  Family  in whom  its 
Spirit becomes  an individuality which turns  towards  another 
sphere and passes  over into  the consciousness  of universality 
The brother leaves  this  immediate  elemental  and  therefore 
strictly speaking  negative ethicalife of the  Family  in  order 
to acq uire and produce the ethical life that is conscious of itself 
and actuaL 

  He passes from  the divine law within whose sphere he 
lived over  to  human law  But the sister becomes  or the wife 
remains  the  head  of the  household  and  the  guardian of the 
divine law In this way  the two sexes overcome their merely 
natural being and appear in their ethical significance as diverse 
beings who share between them the two distinctions belonging 
to the ethical substance These two universal beings of the ethical 
world have therefore their specific individuality in naturally discid
tinct selfconsdousnesses because the ethical Spirit is the immecid
diate  unity of the  substance  with  self  consciousnessan  imme
 Cf  Antigone  l   

C  BB  sPtRIT 

diacy which appears therefore both from the side of reality and 
of difference  as  the existence of a natural difference  It is  that 
side  which in  the shape of individuality  that  is  real  to  itself 
showed  itself in  the  Notion  of spiritual  being  as  an  originally 
determinate  nature  This  moment  loses  the  indeterminateness 
which it still has there and the contingent diversity of disposicid
tions and capacities  It is  now the specific antithesis of the two 
sexes whose natural existence acquires at the same time the sig  
nificance  of their ethical determination 

  The  difference  of the  sexes  and  their  ethical  content 
remains however in the unity of the substance and its  move  
ment is Just the constant becoming of that substance  The huscid
band is sent out by the Spirit of the Famiy into the community 
in  which  he finds  his  selfconscious  being  Just  as  the  Family 
in this way possesses in the community its substance and endurcid
ing being so conversely the community possesses in the Family 
the formal element of its actual existence and in the divine law 
its power and authentication Neither of the two is by itselfabsocid

activity 

  The  universal  ethical  beings  are  then  the  substance 

qua  universal  and the substance qua  an individulli  consciouscid
ness  Their universal  actuality  is  the  nation  and  the  Fmily 
while  they  have  their natural self and  operative individuality 
in  man  and woman  In  this  content  of the  ethical  world  we 
see achieved those ends which the previous insubstantial forms 
of consciousness set themselves what reason apprehended only 
as object has becomeself  consciollsness and what the latter poscid
sessed  only  within  itself is  now  present  as  a  trLle  objective 
reaJity  What observation knew  as  a giLen  object in which  the 
self had no part is  here a  given  custom  but a  reality  which 
is at the same time the deed and the work of the subject finding 
it The individual who seeks the pleasure of enjoying his individucid
ality  finds  it  in  the  Family  and  the  necessity  in  which  that 
pleasure  passes  away is  his  own selfconsciousness  as  a  citizen 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

of his  nation  Or  again  it is  in  knowing  that  the  law of his 
own heart is  the law of all hearts in knowing the consciousness 
of the  self as  the  acknowledged  universal  order  it  is  virtue 
which enjoys the fruits of its sacrifice which brings about what 
it sets  out  to  do  viz  to  bring forth  the  essence  into  the  light 
of day  and  its  enjoyment  is  this  universal  life  Finally  con  
sciousness of the matter in hand itself finds  satisfaction in the 
real substance which contains and preserves in a  positive man  
ner the abstract  moments of that  empty  category  That sub  
stance has in the ethical powers  a genuine content that takes 
the  place  of the  insubstantial  commandments  which  sound 
Reason  wanted  to  give  and  to  know  and  thus  it  gets  an  in 
trinsically  determinate standard for  testing  not  the  laws  but 
what is  done 

  The whole is  a  stable equilibrium of all  the  parts and 
each part is  a Spirit at home in this whole  a Spirit which does 
not seek its satisfaction outside of itself but finds it within itself 
because ids itselfinthis equilibrium with the whole This equim 
librium can it is true only be a living one by inequality arising 
in it and beinghroughtback to equilibrium by Justice Justice 
however is neither an alien entity remote from this whole nor 
the reality unworthy of the name of Justice of mutual malice 
treachery ingratitude etc which would execute judgement in 
an  unreasoning  arbitrary  manner  by misunderstanding  the 
con text of the action and by  unconscious acts of omission and 
commission  On  the  contrary  it is  the  Justice  of human  law 
which brings back into the universal the element of beingfor 
selfwhich has broken away from the  balanced whole  viz  the 
independent classes and individuals it is the government of the 
nation which is  the selfaffirming individuality of the universal 
essence and the selfconscious will of all  The Justice however 
which  brings  back  to  equilibrium  the  universal  in  its  ascencid
dancy over  the  individual  is  equally  the  simple  Spirit  of the 
individual who has suffered wrong it is not split up ihto  two 
the one who has suffered the wrong and an entity in  a  remote 
beyond  The  individual  himself  is  the  power  of the  nether 
world  and it is  his  Erinys his  fury which wreaks vengeance 
For his  individuality his  blood still lives  on in  the  household 
his  substance has  an  enduring reality  The  wrong which  can 
be inflicted on the individual in the ethical realm is simply this 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

that something merely happens to him The power which inflicts 
this  wrong on  the  conscious  individual  of making him  into a 
mere Thing is Nature it is the universality not of the community 
but the  abstract  universality of mere  being  and  the  individual 
in  avenging  the wrong he  has  suffered  does  not  turn  against 
the former  for  it is  not at its  hands  that he  has  suffered  but 
against the latter  As  we saw  the consciousness  of those  who 
share  the blood of the individual repair  this  wrong in such a 
way that what has simply happened becomes rather a work delibercid
ately done in order that the mere being of the wrong its ultimate 
form may also be something willed and th us something agreeable 
  The ethical realm is in this way in its enduring existence 

an immaculate world  a  world  unsullied  by  any  internal  discid
sension Similarly its  process is  a  tranquil  transition of one of 
its powers in to the other in such a wa y that each preserves and 
brings forth the other We do indeed see it divide itself into two 
essences and their reality but their antithesis is rather the authcid
entication of one through the other and where they come into 
direct contact with  each other as  real  opposites  their  middle 
term and common dement is their immediate interpenetration 
The one extreme the universal selfconsciousSpirit  becomes 
through  the  individuality  of the  man  united  with  its  other 
extreme its force and element  with unconscious Spirit  On the 
other  hand  the  divine  law  has  its  individualizationor the 
unconscious  Spirit  of the  individual  its  real  existencein  the 
woman  through  whom  as  the  middle  term  the  unconscious 
Spirit rises  out of its  unreality  into  actual  existence  out of a 
state in which it is  unknowing and unconscious into the realm 
of conscious Spirit  The union of man and woman constitutes 
the  active  middle  term  of the  whole  and  the  element  which 
sunders itself into these extremes of divine and  human law  It 
is equlJly  their immediate union which converts those first two 
syllogisms into one and the same syllogism and unites into one 
process  the opposite  movements  one from  actuality  down  to 
unreality  the downwardmovernent of human law  organized 
into independent members  to  the danger and  trial  of death 
and the other  the upward movement of the law of the  nether 
world to the actuality of the light of day and to conscious existcid
ence  Of these  movements  the former falls  to  man  the latter 
to  woman 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

 

h  Ethical  action  Human  and  Divine  knowledge  Guilt  and  Destiny 

  The way in which  the  antithesis  is  constituted  in  this 
ethical realm is such that selfconsciousness has not yet received 
its due as a  particular individuality There it has  the value on 
the  one hand  merely  of the  universal will  and on the  other 
of consanguinity  This  particular  individual  counts  only  as  a 
shadowy unreality  As  yet  no  deed has  been committed  but 
the deed is  the actual self  It disturbs the peaceful  organization 
and  movement  of the  ethIcal  world  What  there  appears  as 
order and harmony of its two essences each of which authenti 
cates  and  completes  the  other  becomes  through  the  deed  a 
transition of opposites in which each proves itself to be the noncid
reali ty  rather than the au then tication of itself and the other 
It becomes the negative movement or the eternal necessity of 
a  dreadful fate  which engulfs  in  the abyss  of its  single  nature 
divine  and  human  law  alike  as  well  as  the  two  selfconcid
sciousnesses  in  which  these  powers  have  their  existenceand 
for us  passes over into the absolute beingforself of the purely 
individual selfconsciousness 

  The  ground from  which  this  movement starts  and  on 
which it takes place is  the ethical realm what is  active in  this 
movement  however  is  selfconsciousness  Qya  ethical  concid
sciousness  it is  the simple  pure  direction  of activity  towards 
the essentiality of ethical life ie duty  In it there is  no caprice 
and  equally no struggle  no indecision since  the  making  and 
testing of law has been given  up  on  the  contrary  the essence 
of ethical life is for this  consciousness  immediate  unwavering 
without contradictiop Oonsequently we are not faced with the 
sorry spectacle of a collision between passion and duty nor with 
the comic spectacle of a  collision  between  duty  and  dutya 
collision  which  as  regards  its  content  is  the  same  as  that 
between  passion  and  duty  for  passion  is  equally  capable  of 
being seen as a duty because when consciousness separates itself 
from  its  immediate  substantial  essence  and  withdraws  into 
itself  it  becomes  the  merely formal  universal  into  which  one 
content as wen as another fits  equally wellas we found  before 
But the conision of duties  is  comic  because it expresses  a  concid
tradiction viz the contradiction of an Absolute that is opposed 
to itsef an Absolute and then the nothingness of this socalled 

 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

Absolute  or duty  The ethical consciousness  however  knows 
what it has  to do and has  already decided whether  to  belong 
to the divine  or  the  human  law  This  immediate firmness  of 
decision  is  something implicit  and  therefore  has  at  the  same 
time the significance ofa natural being as we have seen Nature 
not the accident of circumstances or choice assigns  one sex  to 
one  law  the  other  to  the  other  law  or  conversely  the  two 
ethical powers  themselves give themselves an  individual existcid
ence  and  actualize  themselves  in the  two  sexes 

  Now because on the one hand the ethical order essencid

tially  consists  in  this  immediate  firmness  of decision  and for 
that reason  there is  for consciousness  essentially only one law 
while on the other hand the ethical powers are real and effeccid
tive in the self of consciousness these powers acq uire the significid
cance of excluding and opposing one another in selfconsciouscid
ness  they exist explicitly whereas in the ethical order they are 
only implicit The ethical consciousness  because  it is  decisively 
for one of the  two  powers  is  essentially character  it does  not 
accept thatbothhavethe same essential nature For this reason 
the opposition between them appears as  an unfortunate collision 
of duty  merely  with  a  reality  which  possesses  no  rights  of its 
own The ethical consciousness is  quaselfconsciousness in this 
opposition and as such it at once proceeds to force  into subjeccid
tion  to  the  law which it accepts  the reality which is  opposed 
to  it  or else  to  outwit it  Since it sees  right  only  on  one  side 
and wrong on  the  other  that consciousness  which  belongs  to 
the divine law seesin the other side only the violence of human 
caprice while that which holds to human law sees in  the other 
only the selfwill and disobedience of the idividual who insists 
on being his  own authority  For the commands of government 
have a  universal  public meaning open to  the light of day the 
will  of the other law however  is  locked  up in  the darkness  of 
the  nether regions  and  in  its  outer existence  manifests as  the 
will of an isolated individual which as  contradicting  the  first 
is  a  wanton outrage 

  In this way there  arises  in consciousness  the  antithesis 
of the known and the unknown just as in substance  there  was 
an antithesis of the conscious and the unconscious and the absocid
lute right of ethical self  consciousness  comes  into conflict  with 
the divine  right  of essential  being  For selfconsciousness  qua 

THE  ETHICAL ORDER 

consciousness  the  world  of objective  reality  as  such  has  an 
essential  being  but according  to  its  substance  it is  the  unity 
of itself and this opposite  and ethical selfconsciousness  is  the 
consciousness  of that  substance  therefore  the  object  in  its 
opposition  to  the  subject  has  lost  entirely  the  significance  of 
having an  essential  being of its  own  Just  as  those  spheres  in 
which it is  only a  Thing have long since vanished so  too  have 
these spheres in which consciousness  gives  a  fixed  existence  to 
something from out of itself and converts  an  isolated  moment 
into essence  Against such onesidednss the  actual world  has 
a  power of its  own  it stands leagued with  truth  against  concid
sciousness and itselfshows the latter what truth is  The ethical 
consciousness  however  has  drunk from  the  cup  of substance 
and has forgotten  all  the  onesidedness  of beingforself of its 
ends and peculiar notions and has therefore at the same time 
drowned in  this  Stygian water al  essentiality of its  own  and 
all  independence of the  objective  actual  world  Its  absolute 
right is therefore that when it acts in accordance with ethical 
law it shall find in this actualization nothing else but the fulfilcid
ment of this law itself and the deed shaH manifest only ethical 
action Vhat is ethical being at once absolute essence and absocid
lute power cannotsufferanyperversion of its content Ifit were 
only absolute essence without power it could suffer perversion 
by the individuality but this as an ethical consciousness when 
it gaveupits onesidedbeingforself renounced itsright to per 
vert the can tent jus t as conversely mere power would be percid
verted  by  essence  if it  were  a  onesided  beingforself  On 
account of this uuity the individuality is  the pure form ofsubcid
startcewhich is the content and the action is  the transition from 
thoughttoactuality merely as the movemehtofan insubstantial 
antithesis whose  moments have no particular  distinctive  concid
tent and no essentiality ofthcir ownOonseq uendy the absolute 
right of the ethical consciousness  is  that the deed  the shape  in 
which it actualizes itself shaH be nothing else  but what it knows 
  But the ethical essence has split itself into two laws and 
consciousness as an undivided attitude towards law is assigned 
only  to  one  Just as  this  simple  unitary consciousness  insists 
as its absolute right that the essence has appeared to it qua ethicid
cal  as  the  essence  is  in  tseljso  too  this  essence  insists  on  the 
right belonging to its reality or on its own right to be a  twofold 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

essence  But at the same time this  right of the essence does not 
stand over against self  consciousness  as  if the  essence  existed 
somewhere else on the  contrary  it is  self  consciousnesss  own 
essence  it has its existence  and its  power in selfconsciousness 
alone and its antithesis is  the act ofself  consciousness itself For 
this latterjust because it is a self to itself and advances to action 
raises itself out of simple immediacy  and spontaneously splits 
itself into two  By this  act it gives  up the specific quality of the 
ethical life  of being the simple certainty of immediate  truth 
and initiates tne division  of itself into itself as  the  active  princid
ciple and into  the reality over against it  a  reality which for 
it is  negative By the deed therefore it becomes guilt  For the 
deed is its own doing and doing is  its  inmost nature And the 
guilt also acquires the  meaning of crime  for  as  simple  ethical 
consciousness  it  has  turned  towards  one law  but  turned  its 
back on  the other and violates  the latter by its  deed  Guilt  is 
not an indifferent ambiguous affair as  if the deed as  actually 
seenjn the lightofday couJdor perhaps could not be the action 
of the self as if with the doing ofitthere could be linked some  
thing external and accidental  that did  not belong  to  it  from 
which aspect  therefore  the action would be innocent  On the 
contrary the action is  itself this splitting into two this explici t 
selfaffirmation  and  the  etablishingoveragainst itself of an 
alien external reality that there is such a reality this stems from 
the  action  itself and  results  from  it  Innocence  therefore  is 
merely nonaction like the mere being of a stone not even that 
ofa child As regards content however  the ethical action concid
tains  the moment of crime  because it does  not do  away  with 
the natural allocation of the two laws tothe two sexes but rather 
being an undivided attitude  towards the law  remains  within 
the sphere of natural immediacy and qua action turns this one 
sidedness in to guilt by seizing on  only one side  of the essence 
and adopting a negative attitude towards  the other ie  violatcid
ing it The place in the universal ethical life of guilt and crime 
of deeds and actions  will  find  more  definite  expression  later 
but this much is immediately evident that it is not this  particucid
lar individual who acts  and is  guilty for  as  this  self he  is  only 
the unrealshadow or he existsmerey as  a  universal self  and 
individuality is  purely theformal moment of the action as such 
the content being the laws  and customs  which  for  the  indivi

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

dual are those of his  class and station  He is  the Substance qua 
genus which by its determinateness becomes indeed a species 
though  the species  remains  at the same  time  the  universal  of 
the genus Selfconsciousness within  the  nation descends from 
the  universal  only as  far  down  as  mere  particularity  and not 
down to the single individuality which posits an exclusive self 
an actual existence which in its action is negative towards itself 
On  the  contrary  its  action  rests  on  secure  confidence  in  the 
whole  unmixed with any alien element neither with fear  nor 
hostility 

  Ethical selfconsciousness now learns from its deed  the 
developed  nature  of what  it  actually  did  as  much  when  it 
obeyed  divine  law  as  when it followed  human  law  The law 
that is  manifest to it is  linked in  the  essence  with its  opposite 
the essence is  the unity of both but the deed  has  only carried 
out one law in  contrast  to  the  other  But  the  two  laws  being 
linked in the essence the fulfilment of the one evokes the other 
andthe deed  haying made it socalls it forth  as  a  violated 
and now hostile entity demanding revenge  In the action only 
one aspect of the resolve as such is clearly manifest The resolve 
however  is  in  itself  the  negative  aspect  which  confronts  the 
resQlve  with  an  other  with  something  aliell  to  the  resolve 
whichknows what it does  Actuality therefore holds concealed 
within it the other aspect which is  alien  to  this knowledge and 
does  not  reveal  the whole  truth about  itself to  consciousness 
the  son  does  not  recognize  his  father  in  the  man  who  has 
wronged him and whom he slays nor his mother in the queen 
whom he makes his wife  In this way a  power which shuns the 
light  of day  ensnares  the  ethical  selfconsciousness  a  power 
which hreaks forth  only after the  deed  is  done and seizes  the 
doer in  the  act  For the accomplished  deed is  the  removal  of 
the antithesis between the knowing self and the actuality con  
fronting it  The doer cannot deny  the crime  or  his  gJIilt  the 
significance of the  deed  is  that  what  was  unmoved  has  heen 
set in motion and that what was  locked up in mere possibility 
has been brought out into the open hence to link together the 
unconscious  and  the  conscious  nonbeing with being  In  this 
truth therefore  the deed is  brought out into the light of day 
as something in which the conscious is  bound up with  the  uncid
conscious what is ones own with what is  alien to it as an entity 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

divided within itself  whose other aspect consciousness  experi 
ences  and also finds  to  be its own but as  the  power it has  vio 
lated  and  roused  to  hostility 

  It can be that the right which lay in  wait is  not present 
in its  own  proper shape  to  the  consciousness  of the  doer  but is 
present only implicitly  in the  inner guilt of the  resolve  and  the 
action But the ethical consciousness is  more complete its  guilt 
more inexcusable if it knows  biforehand the law and the power 
which  it  opposes  if it  takes  them  to  be  violence  and  wrong 
to be ethical merely by accident and like Antigone knowingly 
commits  the crime  The accomplished  deed  completely  alters 
its point of view  the very performance of it declares  that what 
is  ethical  must be actual  for  the  realization  of the  purpose is  the 
purpose of the action Doing directly expresses the unity of actucid
ality and substance it declares that actuality is not an accident 
ofessencf but that in  union with essence it is  not granted  to 
any  right  that is  not  a  true  right  The  ethical  consciousness 
must on account of this  actuality andonaceount of its  deed 
acknowledge  its  opposite  as  its  own  actualitymust  acknowcid
ledge its guilt 

Because  we  suffer we  acknowledge we  have erred 

  Withthisaeknowledgement there is no longer any concid
fliet  between  ethical  purpose  and  actuality  it signifies  the 
return to an ethical frame of mind which knows  that nothing 
counts  but  right  But  the  doer  thereby  surrenders  his  own 
characterandthe reality of his self and has been ruined His being 
consists  in  his  belonging  to  his  ethical law   as  his  substance 
in acknowledging the  opposite law  the  other ceases  to  be for 
him  his  substance  and  instead  of attaining  actuality  it  has 
become an unreality a sentiment or disposition The substance 
does appear it is  true in the individuality as  his  pathos  and 
the individuality appears aslhatwhich animates the sllbstance 
and hence stands above it but the substance is  a  pathos  that 
is  at the same  time  his  character  The ethical  individuality is 
directly  and  intrinsically  one  with  this  his  universal  aspect 
exists in italone and is  incapable of surviving the  destruction 
of this  ethical  power  by  its  opposite 

  Buta t the same time this individ uali ty has the certain ty 
that that individuality whose  pathos  is  this  opposing  power

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

 
suffers no more injury than  it  has  inflicted  The  movement of 
the ethical powers against each other and of the individualities 
calling them into life  and action  have  attained  their true end 
only  in  so  far  as  both  sides  suffer  the  same  destruction  For 
neither  power  has  any  advantage  over  the  other  that  would 
make it a more essential  moment of the  substance  The equal 
essentiality  of both  and  their  indifferent  existence  alongside 
each other means  that they are without a self  In the deed  they 
exist as beings with a self  but with a diverse self and this COna 
tradicts the unity Jf the self and constitutes their unrighteous  
ness  and necessary  destructiori  Character likewise  in  respect 
of its pathos or substance in part belongs to one only in part 
from  the  aspect of knowing  the  one  character like  the  other 
is split up into a conscious and an unconscious part and since 
each  itself calls  forth  this  opposition  and  its  not  knowing  is 
through the deed its own affair each is responsible for the guilt 
which destroys it  The victory of one  power and its  character 
and the  defeat of the other would  thls  be only  the  part  and 
the incomplete work which irresistibly advances to the equilib m 
dum of the two Only in the downfall of both sides alike is abso  
lute right accomplished and the ethical substance as  the nega  
tive  power which engulfs  both  sides  that is  omnipotent and 
righteous  Destiny steps  on  the scene 

  Ifboth powers are taken according to their specific con  
tent and its individuaJization we are presented with the picture 
of the conflict between  them in  their individual forms  On its 
formal side it is  the conflict of the  ethical order and selfCODa 
sciousness with unconscious Nature and the contingency stem  
ming from  Nature  The latter has  a  right against  the  former 
because this is only true Spirit is only in an immediate unity with 
its  substance  On  the  side  of content  it is  the  clash  between 
divine and human law The youth comes away from the uncon  
SciS  Spirit of the  Family and  becomes  the  individuality  of 
the community  But  that he  still  belongs  to  the  Nature  from 
w hieh he  wrenched  himself free  is  evidenced  by  the fact  tha t 
he  emerges  in  the  contingent  form  of two  brothers  each  of 
whom with equal right takes  possession of the community the 
inequality of the earlier and  later  birth  an inequality  which 
is  a natural difference  has no importance for them when they 
enter the  ethical life  of the  community  But  the  government 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

as  the  unitary soul  or  the self of the  national  Spirit  does  not 
tolerate a  duality of individuality and the ethical necessity of 
this  unity is  confronted by the natural accident of there being 
more  than one  These  two  brothers  therefore fall  into dispute 
and  their eq ual  right  to  the  power of the state  destroys  them 
both for they were equally wrong Looked at from  the human 
point of view  the one who has committed the crime is  the one 
who not being in actual possession  attacks  the community at 
the  head of which  the other stood  while  on  the other hand 
he has right on his side who knew how to apprehend the other 
merely  as  an  isolated  individual  detached  from  the  comcid
munity and taking advantage of his  powerlessness  banished 
him he has struck only at the individual as such not the comcid
munity not at  the  essence  of human  right  The  community 
attacked  and  defended  by  what  is  merely  particular  and so 
without a substantial content preserves itself and the brothers 
bring  about  their  own  destruction  through  their  reciprocal 
action  For individuality  which for  the  sake of its  beingforcid
self  puts the whole inpedl has  expelled  itself from  the  comcid
munity  and  is  the  source  of its  own  destruction  The  comcid
mqnity  however  will  honour  the  one  who  was found  on  its 
side  but  the  government  the  restored  unitary  self  of  the 
community  will  punish  him  who  already  proclaimed  its 
devastation on  the  walls  of the  city  by  depriving him  of the 
last honour  He  who  wantonly  attacked  the  Spirits  highest 
form  of consciousness  the  Spirit of the  community  must  be 
stripped  of the  honour  of his  entire  and  finished  being  the 
honour due  to  the  Spirit of the departed 

  But if the  universal  thus  easily knocks  off the very  tip 
of the  pyramid anci  indeed  carries  off the  victory  over  the 
rebellious principle of pure individuality viz  the Family it has 
thereby merely entered ona conflict with the divinelaw a concid
fEct  of selfconscious  Spirit with  what is  unconscious  For  the 
latter  is  the  other  essential  power  and  is  therefore  not  decid
stroyed  but  merely  wronged  by  the  conscious  Spirit  But it 
has only the bloodless shade to  help it in actually carrying out 
ilslaw in face of the power and authority of that other publicly 
manifest law Being the law of weakness and darkness it therecid
fore at first succumbs to the powerful law of the  upper world 
for  the power of the former is  effective in  the  underworld  not 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

on earth But the outwardly actual which has taken away from 
the inner world its honour and power has in so doing consumed 
its  own  essence  The  publicly  manifest  Spirit  has  the  root  of 
its  power  in  the  nether  world  The  selfcertainty  and  selfcid
assurance of a nation possesses the truth of its oath which binds 
all  into one  solely  in  the  mute  unconscious  substance  of all 
in  the  waters  of forgetfulness  Thus it is  that the  fulfilment  of 
the Spirit of the  uppr world is  transformed  into its  opposite 
and it learns  that its  supreme  right is  a  supreme  wrong  that 
its  victory is  rather  its  own  downfall  The  dead  whose  right 
is  denied  knows  therefore  how  to  find  instruments  of  vencid
geance which are equally effective and powerful as  the power 
which  has  injured  it  These  powers  are  other  communities 
w hose  altars  the  dogs  or birds defiled  with  the  corpse  which 
is not raised into unconscious universality by being given back 
as  is  its  due  to  the  elemental  individuality  the  earth  but 
remains above ground in  the  realm  of outer  reality  and  has 
now  acqpiredas  a  force  of divine  law  a  self  conscious  real

  In this  representation  the  movement  of human  and 
divineJaw finds its necessity expressed in individuals in whom

ment  ppears as  the  action  of individuals  which  gives  the 
appearance of contingency to the necessity of the activity  But

the Family is  at the same time in general its  element  the incid

community only gets an existence through its interference with 
the happiness of the Family and by dissolving individual selfcid

universal end of the government into a  private end transforms 
its universal activity into a  work of some particular individual 
and perverts the universal property of the state into a possession

cule  the  earnest  wisdom  of mature  age  which  indifferent  to 
purely private pleasures and enjoyments as  well as  to playing 
an active part only thinks of and cares for  the  universal  She 
makes this wisdom an object of derision for  raw  and irresponcid
sible youth and unworthy of their enthusiasm  In general she 
maintains that itis the power of youth  that really counts the 
worth of the son  lies  in  his  being  the lord  and  master of the

dence  on  the  family  obtains  the  enjoyment  and  dignity  of 
wifehood  The community however can only maintain itself 
by suppressing  this  spirit  of individualism  and  because it is 
an essential moment all the same creates it and moreover crecid
ates it by its repressive attitude towards it as ahostile principle 
However  this  principle  being  merely  evil  and  futile  in  its 
separation from  the universal end  would  be quite ineffectual 
if the community itself did not recognize  the  power of youth 
the  manhood  which  while  immature still stands  within  the 
sphereofindividuality as the power of the whole For thecoma

Spirit and the form in which the essential moment of the ethical 
substance  the absolute  freedom  of the ethical self from  every 
existential form is  present in its actual and authentic existence 
While  on  the one hand war  makes  the  individual  systems  of 
property and personal independence  as  well as  the personality 
of the individual himself feel  the power of the negative on the 
other hand this negativity is  prominent in war as  that which 
preserves  the whole  The brave youth in  whom  woman  finds 
her pleasure the suppressed  principle of corruption  now  has 
his day and his worth is openly acknowledged Now it is  physicid
cal strength and what appears as  a  matter of luck  that decides 
on the existence of ethical life  and spiritual necessity  Because 
the existence of ethical life rests ons trengthand luck thedeczsion 
is already madethatits downfall has come Just as previously only 
the Penates succumbed to the national Spirit so  nowthe living 
Spirits of the nation succumb through their own individuality 
and perish in a  universal community whose simple universality 
is soulless  and dead  and is  alive only in  the  single  individual 
qua single The ethicaLshape of Spirit has vanished and another 
takes its  place 

  This ruin of the ethical Substance and its  passage  into 
another form  is  thus  determined  by the fact  that  the  ethical 
consciousness isdiFectedon to theJaw in away thatis essentially 
immediate This determination of immediacy means that N ature 
as such en ters in to  the ethical act  the  reality of which simply 
reveals the contradiction and the germ of destruction inherent

  The  universal  unity  into  which  the  living  immediate 
unity of individuality and substance withdraws  is  the soulless 
community which has ceased to be the substanceitselfunconcid
sciousofindividuals and in which  they now have  the value 
of selves  and  substances  possessing  a  separate  being  forself 
The  universal  being thus split up  in to  a  mere  multiplicity  of 
individuals this lifeless Spirit is an equality in which all count 
the same ie  as persons  What in the world of the ethical order 
was  called  the  hidden  divine  law  has  in  fact  emerged  from 
its inward state into actuality in the former state the individual 
was actual and counted as such  merely as  a  bloodrelation of 
the family  As  this  particular individual he was  the  departed 
spirit devoid of a self now however he has emerged from his 
unreal existence Because the ethical substance is  only  the true 
Spirit  the individual  therefre withdraws into  the  certainty  of 
his  ownself he is  that substance as  the positive  universal  but 
his  actuality consists  in  his  being a  negative  universal  self  We 
saw the  powers and shapes of the ethical world swallowed up 
in  the simple necessity of a  blank Destiny  This  power of the 
ethical world is  the substance reflected  into its simple  unitary 
nature butthat being which is  reflected  back into itself that 
very necessity of blank Destiny  is  nothing else  but  theT of 
selfconsciousness 

  This  therefore  counts  henceforth  as  a  being that is 
in and for  itself  To  be so  acknowledged  is  its  substantiality 
But  it  is  an  abstract  universality  because  its  content  is  this 
rigid  unyielding  self  not  the  self  that  is  dissolved  in  the 
substance 

  Personality then has stepped out of the life of the ethi 
cal substance I tis the independence of consciousness  an inde 
pendence which has actual validity  The nonactual thought of 
it  which  came  from  renouncing  the  actual  world  appeared 
earlier as  the Stoical  seWconsciousness  Just as  this  proceeded 
from lordship and bondage as  the immediate existence of selfcid
consciousness so personality has proceeded from the immediate 
life of Spirit which is  the universal dominating will of all and 
equally their service ofohedience What was for Stoicism only 
the ahstractionof an intrinsic reality is  now an actual world toi

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

cism is  nothing else  but the consciousness  which  reduces  to its 
abstract form the principle oflegal sta tus an independence tha t 
lacks  the  life  of Spirit  By  its  flight  from  the  actual  world  it 
attained only  to  the  thought  of independence  it is  absolutely 
for  itself  in  that it does  not attach its  being  to  anything  that 
exists  but claims  to  give  up everything  that exists  and  places 
its  essence  solely  in  the  unity  of pure  thought  In  the  sanle 
way  the  right  of a  person  is  not  tied  to  a  richer  or  more 
powerful  existence  of the  individual  as  such  nor  again  to  a 
universal  living  Spirit  but  rather  to  the  pure  One  of  its 
abstract  actuality  or  to  that  One  qua  selfconsciousness  in 
general 

  Now jus t as the abstract independence of Stoicism exhibcid

ited  the process of  its actualization so  too will this  last form 
of independence    personality recapitulate the process of the 
first form  The former  passes  over in to  the sceptical confusion 
of cons do us ness  into a  negative rambling which lacking any 
stable  form  strays  fortuitously  from  one  form  of being  and 
thought to another dissolving them it is  true in its absolute 
independence butno less recreating them itis in fact  merely 
the contradiction of a  consciousness which is at once indepen  
dent and  dependent  Personal independence in  the sphere of 
legal  right  is  really a  similar general  confusion  and  reciprocal 
dissolution of this  kind  For what counts as  absolute  essential 
being is  selfconsciousness as the sheer empty unit of the person 
In contrast to this empty universality substance has  the form 
offttlness and content  and this content is now set free and is  uncid
organized for  the  Spirit that subdued it and held  it together 
in its  unity is  no longer present This empty unit of the person 
is  therefore in its reality a contingent existence and essentially 
a  process  and an  action that comes to  no  lasting  result  Like 
Scepticism theformalismoflegalright is thus by its very nature 
without a peculiar content of its own itfinds before it manicid
fold existence in the form of possession and as Scepticism did 
stamps  it with  the  same  abstract  universality  whereby  it is 
called property But whereas in Scepticism the reality so detercid
mined  is  called  an illusory  appearance  and  has  only  a  negative 
value in legal right it has a positive value That negative value 
consists  in  the  actual  having  the  significance  of the  self qua 
thought qua the implicit universal the positive value in the case 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

  
of legal right  however consists  in  its  being  mine  in  the  sense 
of the category  as  something whose  validity  is  recognized  and 
actual  Both are the same abstract  universal  The actual content 
or  the  specific  character of what  is  minewhether  it  be  an 
external possession or also  the inner riches or poverty of spirit 
and characteris not contained in  this  empty form  and does 
not concern it  The content  belongs  therefore  to  an  autonO m 
mOllS  power which is something different from the formal  unicid
versal to a power which is arbitrary and capricious Consciouscid
ness  of right  therefore in  the very fact  of being recognized  as 
having validity experiences rather the loss of its reality and its 
complete inessentiality and to describe an individual as  a perm 
son  is  an expression  of contempt 

 I  The free  power of the content determines itself in such 
a way that the dispersion of the content into a sheer multiplicity 
of personal atoms is  by  the  nature of this  determinateness  at 
the same time gathered into a  single  point alien  to  them and 
soulless as  well  This single poin t is on  the one  hand  like  the 
unyielding  rgidity of their  personality  a  merely  single  peTcid
sonality  but in contrast to  their empty singleness  it has at the 
sametime the significance for them of the whole content hence 
of real essence and as  against their presumedly absolute  but 
intrinsicallyessencelessreality it is absolute power and absolute 
actuality  This lord and  master of the world  holds  himself in 
this wayto he the absolute person at the same time embracing 
wi thin himself the whole of existence the person for whom there 
exists nosuperior Spirit He is a person but the solitary person 
who stands over against all  the  rest  These  constitute  the  real 
authoritative universality of that person for  the single indivicid
dual as  such is  true only  as  a  universal  multiplicity  of single 
individuals  Cut off from  this  multiplicity  the  solitary  self is 
in fact an unreal impotent self At the same time it is  thecon  
sciousness  of the  content  which  has  placed  itself in  antithesis 
to  that  universal  personality  But this  content  liberated from 
the negative power controlling it is the chaos of spiritual powers 
which  in  their  unfettered  freedom  become  elemental  beings 
raging  madly  against  one  another  in  a  frenzy  of destructive 
activity  Their  impotent  selfconsciousness  is  the  defenceless 
enclosed arena of their tum ul t  In this  know ledge of himself as 
the sum and substance ofa actual powers this lord and master 

THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

 
of the world is  the titanic selfconsciousness  that thinks of itself 
as  being an actual living god  But since  he  is  only  the formal 
selfwhich is unable to tame those powers his activities and selfcid
enjoyment are equally  monstrous excesses 

  The lord of the world becomes really conscious of what 

he is viz the universal power of the actual world in the destruccid
tive power he exercises  against the self of his subjects  the self 
which stands over against him  For his  power is  not  the  union 
and harmony  of Spirit in  which  persons  would  recognize  their 
own selfconsciousness  Rather  they  exist  as  persons  on  their 
own account and exclude any continuity with others from the 
rigid  unyieldingness  of their atomicity  They  exist  therefore 
in a merely negative relationship  both  to  one another and  to 
him who is their bond of connection or continuity As  this eonticid
nuity he is  the essence and the content of their merely formal 
self  but a  content alien to them and a  hostile being which in 
reality deprives  them of that very  thing which  they regard as 
their essen tial na ture viz  the completely empty form of beingcid
forself  and again  as  the continuity of their personality  he 
destroys  this  very  personality  itself  Legal  personality  thus 
learns rather that it is  without any substance  since  the  alien 
content makes itselfauthoritative in it and does so because that 
content is  the reality  of such  personality  On the other hand 
by  indulging  in  this  destructive  activity  in  this  insubstantial 
arena the lord of the world obtainsfor himself the consciousness 
of his complete supremacy However this self is  a mere laying  
waste of everything and  therefore  merely  beside  itself  and  is 
really  the abandonment of its  own selfconsciousness 

  Such then is  the constitution of that aspect in which 

selfconsciousness  qua  absolute  Being  is  actual  But  the  concid
sciousness that is driven  back into itseffrom this actuality ponders 
this its inessential nature Earlier we saw  the Stoical indepencid
dence of pure thought pass through Scepticism andfind its truth 
in  the  Unhappy  Oonsciousnessthe  truth  about  what  con 
stitutes its  own  true  being  If this  knowledge  appeared  then 
merely as  the onesided view of consciousness as  consciousness 
here  the  actual  truth  of that view  has  become  apparent  This 
truth consists in the fact that this universally acknowledged authority 
of selfconsciousness  is  the  reality  from  which  it is  alienated 
This acknowledgement of its authority is  the universal actuality 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
of the self  but this  actuality  is  directly  the  perversion  of the 
self as well it is  the loss of its essence  The actuality of the self 
that did not exist in the ethical world has been won by its return 
into the person  what in the former was harmoniously one now 
emerges in a  developed form  but as  alienated from  itself 

B  SELFALIENATED SPIRIT  CULTURE 

  The  ethical  Substance  kept  the  antithesis  confined 
within its simply unitary consciousness and preserved this con 
sciousness in an immediate unity with its essence  Essence has 
therefore  the  simple  determinateness  of mere  being for  concid
sciousness  which  is  directed  immediately  upon  it  and  is  the 
essence in the form of custom  Consciousness  neither thinks of 
itself  as  thzs  particular  exclusive  self  nor  has  substance  the 
significance  of  an  existence  excluded  from  it  with  which 
it would have to become  united only by alienating itself from 
itselfand at the same time producing the substance itself  But 
the Spiritwhose selfis an absolutely discrete unit has its content 
confronting it as  an equally hard unyielding reality  and here 
the  world  has  the character of being something external  the 
negative of selfconsciousness  This world is  however  aspiri 
tualentityit is  initselftheinterfusion of being and  individu 
aHty this  its  existence  is  the  work  of selfconsciousness  but it 
is also an alien reaHtyalready present andgiven a reality which 
has a being of its own and in which it does  not recognize itself 
This real world is  the external essence  and  the free  content of 
legal rightBut this external world which the lord of the world 
oflegal righttakes to himselfis not merely thiselemen tal being 
confronting the  self as  something contingently  given   on  the 
contrary it is his work  but not in a  positive rather in a nega  
tive sense  It obtains its  existence  through sefconSclousnesss 
own  externalization  and  separation  of itself from  its essence 
which in the ruin and devastation which prevail in the  world 
onegal rightseems to inflict on selfconsciousness from without 
the violence of the liberated elements These by themselves are 
sheer ruin  and  devastation  and  the dissolution  of themselves 
This dissolutionhowever this negative nature of theirs isjust 
thesdf it is their subject  their activity and their process  But 
this activity and process whereby the substance becomes actual 

CULTURE 

 
is the alienation of the personality for the self that has an absocid
lute significance  in its  immediate  existence  ie  without having 
alienated  itself from  itself  is  without  substance  and  is  the 
plaything of those  raging elements  Its  substance  therefore  is 
its externalization and the externalization is  the substance ie 
the  spiritual  powers  ordering  themselves  into  a  world  and 
thereby preserving  themselves 

  Substance is in this way Spirit  the  selfconscious  unity 
of the self and essence  each has for  the other the significance 
ofalienation Spirit is  the consciousness of an objective real world 
freely existing on is own account but this consciousness is concid
fronted by the unity of the self and essence  actual consciousness 
by pure consciousness On the one side actual selfconsciousness 
through its externalization  passes  over into the  actual world 
and the latter back into actual selfconsciousness  On the other 
side  this  same  actualityboth  person  and  objectivityis

therefore each of its  powers exists  in  this  unity  and  in so  far 
as they are qistinct from  one another they are in equilibrium 
with the whole Nothing has the significance of being the negacid
tiveof selfconsciousness even the departed spirit is  present in 
his bloodTela tionship in the self of the family an d the universal 
power of the government is the will  the self of the nation Here 
however what is present has the significance only of an objec tive 
reality  the  consciousness  of which  exists  in  a  beyond  each 
single moment qua essence receives  this  and with it actuality 
from al other and so far as it is actual its essence is something 
other  than  its  own  actuality  Nothing  has  a  Spirit  that  is 
grounded within  itself and indwells  it  but each has  its  being 
in something outside of and alien to it  The equilibrium of the 
whole is  not the  unity which remains with itself  nor  the  con 
tentment that comes from  having returned into itself  but rests 
on the alienation of opposites  The whole  therefore  like  each 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

single  moment  is  a  selfalienated actuality  it falls  apart into 
a  realm in which selfconsciousness  as  well  as  its  object is  actual 
and into another the realm of pure  consciousness which lying 
beyond  the first  is  not a  present actuality  but exists  only  for 
Faith  Now just as  the  ethical world which  is  separated  into 
divine and human law in their various forms and its consciouscid
ness which is separated into knowing and notknowing returns 
from that dividedness into its destiny into the self as the negative 
power of this antithesis so  these two realms of the seWalienated 
Spirit will  also  return into the self  but if the  former  was  the 
first  merely immediately valid self  the single person  this second 
realm  which returns out of its exiernalization into itself  will 
be  the  universal  self  the  consciousness  which  has  grasped  its 
Notion  and these spiritual worlds aU  of whose  moments insist 
on a  fixed  actuality and nonspiritual existence  of their  own 
will  dissolve  in pure  intellectual  insight  This  insight  as  the  self 
that apprehends itself completes the stage of  culture it apprecid
hends nothing but self and everything as self ie  it comprehends 
everything wipes out the objectivity of things and converts all 
intrinsic being in to a  being for itself In its  hos tilitytoF aith  as

time realizes itself and produces its own objectrhe unknowable 
ahsolute Being and the principle of utility Since in this way actu

actual world is overthrown This revolution gives birthto absocid

Spirit has completey  returned into itself  has  abandoned  this 
region of culture and passes  on  to  another region  the  region 
of the  moral consciousness 

I  THE  WORLD  OF  SELFALIENATED  SPIRIT 

  The world  of this  Spirit breaks  up into two  The  first 

CULTURE 

 

is  the world of reality or of its  selfalienation  but  the  other is 
that which Spirit rising above the first  constructs  for  itself in 
the Aether of pure consciousness  This second world  standing 
in antithesis to that alienation is  for  that very  reason  not free 
from it on the contrary it is  really only the other form  of that 
alienation which consists precisely in being conscious of two difcid
ferent  worlds  and which embraces  both  Therefore  it  is  not 
the selfconsciousness of absolute being as  it is  in  and for  itself 
not religion  that is  here  dealt with  but Faith so  far  as  this  is 
aflightfrom the real world and thus is  not in  and for itself  This 
fligh t from the realm of the present is  therefore in its own self 
dualnatured  Pure  consciousness  is  the  element  into  which 
Spirit raises  itself  but it is  not only  the  element of Faith  but 
equally of the  Notion Consequently both together make  their 
appearance at the same time and  the former comes  into concid
sideration  only in  its  antithesis  to  the latter 

a  Culture  and its  realm  of actuality 

  The Spirit of this world is  a spiritual essence  that is  percid

meated  bya selfconsciousness  which  knows  itself  and  knows 
the eSsence as  an actuality confronting it  But the  existence of 
this  world as  also  the  actuality  of selfconsciousness  rests  on 
the  process  in which  the  latter divests  itself of its  personality 
thereby creating its world This world it looks on as  something 
alien a world therefore of which it must now  take possession 
But the renunciation of its  being  forself is  itself the product of 
the actul world and by this  renunciation therefore selfconcid
sciousness  directly takes  possession  of this  world  Or we  may 
say that selfconsciousness  is  merely a  something  it has  actucid
ality  only in so far as it alienates itself from  itself  by so  doing 
itgives itsefthe character ofa universal and this its universality 
is  its authentication and actuality  This equality  with  everyone 
is  therefore  not the  equality of the sphere of legal  right  not 
that immediate  recognition  and  validity  of selfconsciousness 
simply because it is  on the contrary  to  be valid it must have 
conformed itself to  the  universal  by  the  mediating  process  of 
alienation The nonspiritual universality of the sphere of legal 
right accepts every natural form of character as well as of existcid
ence  and justifies  them  The  universality  which  counts  here 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

however is one that has made itselfwhat it is and for that reason 
is  actual 

  It  is  therefore  through  culture  that  the  individual 

acquires standing and actuality His true orlginal nature and subcid
s tance is the aliena tion of himself as S piri t from his natural being 
This externalization is therefore both the purpose and the excid
istence of the individual it is at once the means or the transition 
both of the  mere  thoughtJorm  of substance  into  actuality  and 
conversely of the specific individuality into essentiality  Thisindivicid
duality moulds itself by culture into what it intrinsically is and 
only by so doing is it an intrinsic being that has an actual existcid
ence the  measure of its  culture is  the  measure of its  actuality 
and power  Although here  the self knows  itself as  this  self  yet 
its actuality consists solely in the settingaside of its natural self 
Oonsequently the originally specific nature is  reduced to the uncid
essential difference of quantity  to  a  greater or lesser  energy of 
will  But the  purpose and content of the  will  belong solely  to 
the universal substance itself and can only be a  universal  The 
particularity of a  nature which becomes purpose and content is 
something powerless  and  unreal it is  a  kind  of being  which 
vainly and ridiculously strains  every nerve  to  get  going  it is 
the contradiction of giving  to  what  is  particular an  actuality 
which is  immediately  a  universal  If  therefore  individuality 
is erroneously supposed to be rooted in the particularity ofnature 
and character then in the actual world there areno individualicid
ties  and no characters but everyone is  like everyone else  but 
this  presumed  individuality  really  only  exists  in  someones 
mind an imaginary existence which has no abiding place in this 
world where only that which externalizes itself ana therefore 
only the universal obtains an actual existence That is why such 
an imagined  existence  is  esteemed for what it is  for  a  kind  of 
being  Kind  is  not quite  the same as  espece  the most horrid 
of all  nicknames for  it  denotes  mediocrity  and  expresses  the 
highest degree of contempt   Kind and good of its kind are 
however German  expressions  which  add  an air of honesty  to 
this meaning as if it were not really meant so  badly or again 
consciousness is  in fact  not yet aware what kind and what 
culture  and  reality  are 

  What in relation to the single individual  appears as  his 

 Diderot  Nephew  of Rameau 

CULTURE 

 
culture  is  the  essential  moment of the substance  itself  viz  the 
immediate  passage  of  the   mere  thoughtform  of  its  unicid
versality  into  actuality  or  culture  is  the  simple  soul  of the 
substance by means of which what is  implicit in the substance 
acquires an acknowledged real existence  The process in which the 
individuality moulds itself by culture is  therefore at the same 
time the development of it as  the  universal  objective  essence 
ie  the development of the actual world  Although  this  world 
has  come  into being  through  individuality  it  is  for  selfconcid
sciousness immediately an alienated world which has the form 
of a fixed and solid reality over against it But at the same time 
certain that this world is  its  substance  it sets  about making it 
its  own  It  gains  this  power  over  it  through  culture  which 
looked at from this aspect has the appearance of selfconscious  
ness making itself conform to reality and doing so to the extent 
that  the  energy  of its  original  character  and  talent  permits 
What appears here as the power and authority of the individual 
eXfrcised  over  the  substance  which  is  thereby superseded  is 
the same  thing as  the actualization  of the substance  For  the 
power of the individual consists in conforming itself to that subcid
stance  ie  in  externalizing its  own  self and  thus  establishing 
itself as  substance  that has  an objective  existence  Its  culture 
andits own actuality are therefore the actualization of the subcid
stance itsel 

  The self knows itself as actual only as  a  transcended sel 
Therefore it is  not constituted by  the  unity  of consciousness  of 
itselfand the object on the contrary the object is for  the self 
its negative  Thus  by  means of the self as  soul of the  process 
substance is so moulded and developed in its moments that one 
opposite stirs the other into life each by its  alienation from  the 
other gives it an existence and equallyreceives from it an existcid
ence  of its  own  At the same  time  each  moment  possesses  its 
ownspecific nature as something unchallengeably valid and as 
a firm reality visitvis  the  other  Thinking fixes  this difference 
in  the most general way by the absolute  antithesis  of good  and 
bad which  shunning each  other  cannot in any way  become 
one and the same  The soul of this fixed  being however is  the 
immediate transition  into  its  opposite  existence  is  really  the 
perversion of every determinateness into its  opposite  and it is 
only this alienation that is  the essential  nature and support of 

C  BB  SPIR IT 

 
the whole  We have now  to consider this  process  in  which  the 
moments  are  stirred  into  life  and  given  an  existence  of their 
own  the  alienation  will  alienate  itself  and  the  whole  will 
through  this  alienation  return  fnto  its  Notion 

  We have first  to consider the simple  unitary substance 
itself in the i mmedia te  organization of its  momen ts  which are 
present in the substance  but as  yet  have  not been stirred  into 
life  In the same way that Nature displays itselfin the universal 
elements of Air  Water  Fire  and  Earth  Air is  the  enduring 
purely universal and transparent element Water the element 
that is  perpetually sacrificed  Fire  the  unity  which  energizes 
them  into  opposition  while  at  the  same  time  it  perpetually 
resolves the opposition lastly Earth which is the firm and solid 
knot of this articulated whole  the subject of these elements and 
of their process that from which they start and  to  which  they 
return so  in  the same  way  the  inner essence  or simple  Spirit 
of selfconscious  actuality  displays  itself in  similar  such  unicid
versalbut here spiritualmasses or spheres  displays  itself 
as  a world  In thefirst sphere it is  an implicitly universal selfcid
iden tical spiritual being in the second it is  explicitly for  itself 
and has become inwardly divided against itself sacrificing and 
abandoning itself  in  the  third  which  as  selfconsciousness  is 
Subject  it possesses  directly  in its  own  self the  force  of Fire 
In the first it is  conscious of itself as  an  intrinsic  being  hutin 
the second it develpps an explicitheing of its own by sacrificing 
the universal  Spirit however is  itself at once  the  essence  and 
the actuality of the whole which sunders itself into a substance 
which  endures  and  a  substance  which  sacrifices  itselfand 
which at the same time also  takes  them  back into its  unity it 
is  both  the  outburst of flaming  Fire which consumes  the subM 
stance  and  also  the  abiding  form  of that  substance  We  see 
that these spheres correspond to  the community and the family 
in  the  ethical world  without  however  possessing  the  native 
Spirit peculiar to the latter On the other hand while Destiny 
is  alien to  this Spirit here selfconsciousness is  and knows  itself 
to  be  the  real  power of these  spheres 

  We have  to  consider  how  in  the  first  instance  these 
two  members  are  represented  within  pure  consciousness  as 
thoughts or as having only an implicit being and also how they 
are  represented  in  actual  consciousness  as  having  an  objective 

CULTURE 

 

existence In the simple form of thoughts the first is the Goodcid
the  selfaccordant  immediate  and  unchangeable  essence  of 
every consciousness the independent spiritual power of the incid
itself alongside  which  the  activity  of  actual  consciousness  is 
something merely incidental  Its other on the contrary is  the 
passive spiritual ssence or the universal in so far as  it surrenders 
itselfand allows individuals to get in it the consciousness of their 
separate existence it is  the essence that is  null and invalid the 
Bad This absolu te  breakup of the essence is  itself permanent 
While  the  first  essence  is  the  foundation  starting  point  and 
result ofindividuals who in it are purely universal the second 
on  the  other  hand  is  partly  their  seWsacrificing  bcingforcid
another  and  partly  for  that  very  reason  their  perpetual 
returntoselfas separate individuals and the perpetual process 
in  which  they  develop a  being of their own 

  But secondly  these simple thoughts  of Good  and Bad 
are likewise immedia tel yself  aliena ted they are actual and are 
present in actual consciousness  as  obJective  moments  Thus  the 
first essence is  state power the other is  wealth  As  state power is 
the simplesuhstancerso too is ittheuniversal worktheabsolute 
heartofthematteritselfinwhich individuals find their essential 
nature  expressed  and  where  their  separate individuality  is 
merely a consciousness of their universality  I t is  also the  work 
and the simple result  from  which  the sense  that it results from 
their doing has vanished it remains the absolute foundation and 
subsistence of all  that they do This simple  ethereal substance 
of their life is in virtue of this determination oftheh unchange a 
ableselfidentity mereheingand in addition merely a beingcid
foranother  It is  thus  directly  the  opposite  of itself  wealth 
Although this  is  indeed something  passive  something  devoid 
of inner worth it is  equally the perpetually produced result of 
the labour and  activity of all just as  it is  dissipated  again  in 
the enjoyment of all It is true that in the enjoyment theindivi  
duality develops an awareness of himself as  a particular indivicid
dual  but  this  enjoyment  itself  is  the  result  of  the  general 
activity just as  reciprocally wealth produces universal labour 
and enjoyment for all  The actual has simply the spiritual sigcid
nificance  of being  immediately  universal  Each  individual  is 
quite sure  that he  is  acting  in  his  own  interest  when  seeking 
this enjoyment for  it  is  in  this  that he  becomes  conscious  of 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
his own independent existence and for that reason does not take 
it to be something spiritual Yet  even when looked at from  an 
external  point  of view  it  is  evident  that  each  in  his  own 
enjoyment  provides  enjoyment for  all  just as  in  working  for 
himselfhe is at the same time working for all and all are working 
for  him  His being for  himself is  therefore  in  itself universal and 
his selfinterest is something merely in his mind something that 
cannot get as  far  as  making  a  reality  of what  it  means  to  do 
viz  to  do something that would not  benefit all 

  In tbese  two spiritual powers  then  selfconsciousness 
recognizes  its  substance  content  and  purpose  in  them  it 
beholds its  dual nature  in  one it sees  what it implicitly is  in 
the other what it is explicitly for itself But it is at the same time 
qua  Spirit  the  negative  unity  of their  subsistence  and  of the 
separation of individuality from  the  universal  or of actuality 
and  the  self  Dominion  and  wealth  therefore  confront  the 
individual as objects ie as things from which he knows himself 
to  be free  and  between  which  he  believes  he  can  choose  or 
even chooseneither As this free and pure consdousnessheconcid
fronts the essence as something which is merelyor him  He has 
then the essence qua essence within himself  In this pure concid
sciowmess the moments ofsuhstanceare for himnotstatepower 
and wealth butthe thoughts of Good and Bad But further selfcid
consciousness is the relationofitspure consciousness tOltsactual 
consciousness of what is  in the fOfm  of thought to what exists 
objectively it is  essentially judgement  It is  true that the immecid
diate determinations of the  two sides  of objective reality have 
already made clear which is Good and which is  Bad the Good 
isstate power the Bad is wealth But this first judgement cannot 
beregarded as a spiritual judgement for in it one side has been 
determined only as a beinginitseif or as  the positive the other 
only as  a  beingforitself  and as  the  negative  But as  spiritual 
essences each is  the interfusion of both momen ts  and is  therecid
fore not exhaustedin those determinations and selfconsciouscid
ness which is selfrelated is  both in  andjor itself  It must therecid
fore he related to each determination in a  twofbld manner with 
the  result  that  their  nature  which  consists  in  being  selfcid
alienated determinations  will  be  brought  to light 

  Now  selfconsciousness  holds  that  object  to  be  good 
and to  possess intrinsic being in which it finds  itself  and that 

CULTURE 

to  be bad in which it finds  the  opposite  of itself  Goodness  is 
the likeness  of objective  reality  to  it  Badness  however  their 
unlikeness At the same time what for selfconsciousness is good 
and bad is intrinsically good and bad for it isjust that in which 
these two moments of intrinsic being and ofbeingJor it  are the 
same  It is  the  actual  Spirit of the  objective  realities  and  the 
judgementis the proofofits power within them a power which 
makes  them into what they are  in  themselves  It is  not how they 
are like or unlike directly in themselves ie not abstract beingcid
initself or beingfaritself that is  their criterion and their truth 
but how they are in the relation of Spirit to them their likeness 
or  unlikeness  to  Spirit  Spirits  relation  to  them  in  virtue  of 
which they lose  their initial status of objects  and  develop  their 
own initself or intrinsic nature becomes at the same time  their 
reflection  into  themselves  through  which  they  acquire  an actual 
spiritual  being  and  what  their  Spirit is  comes  to  view  But 
just as  their first  immediate determinatton is distinctfrom the relacid
tion  of Spirit  to  them  so  also  will  the  third  moment  their 
own  proper  Spirit  be  distinct  from  the  second  First  of all 
their  second  initself  which stems  from  the  relation  of Spirit 
to  them  must  of  course  turn  out  to  be  different  from 
the  immediate  initself  for  this  mediation  of Spirit  rather  acts 
on the immedate determiQateness and makes it into something 
else 

  It follows  then  that  the  consciousness  that  is  in and 

fdr itselfdoesfind in the state power its simple essence and subcid
sistence in general but not its individuality as such it does find 
there  its  intrinsic  being  but not what it explicitly  is Jor  itself 
Ratheritfinds that the state power disowns action qua indivicid
dual  action  and  subdues  it into  obedience  The  individual 
therefore  faced  with  this  power  rcflects  himself into  himself 
it is  for  him  an  oppressor  and  the  Bad  for  instead  of being 
of like nature to himself its nature is  essentially different from 
that of individuality Wealth on the other hand is  the Good 
it leads  to  the  general enjoyment  is  there  to  be  made  use  of 
and  procures for everyone  the  consciousness  of his  particular 
self It is implicitly universal beneficence if it refuses a particular 
benefi t andcloes nt choose to satisfy every need this is accidencid
tal and does not detract from its universal and necessary nature 
of imparting itself to  all  and being a  universal provider 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

  These two judgements give  the  thoughts  of Good and 
Bad  a  content which is  the  opposite of what  they  had for  us 
But selfconsciousness was at first only incompletely related  to 
its objects viz  only according to the criterion of beingfarself 
Oonsciousness has eq uall y however an intrinsic nature of its own 
and must likewise make this aspect a  criterion and only when 
it has done this is  the spiritual judgement complete According 
to  this  aspect  the state  power expresses  its  essence  this  power 
is in part the established law and in part government and comcid
mand  which  regulates  the  particular  activities  within  the 
action of the whole  The one is  the simple Substance itself  the 
other is its action which animates and sustains itself and everycid
one  The individual thus finds  therein  his  ground and essence 
expressed organized and manifested  On the other hand  the 
individual through the enjoyment of wealth gains  no expericid
ence of his universal nature hut only getsatransitoryconsdou
ness  and ettjoyment of himstlf qua  single and independent incid
dividual and of the disparity between himself and his essence  
The IN otions of Good and Bad thus Tcceivehereacon tent w hieh 
is  the opposite of what  they had before 

  Each of these two ways of judging finds  a  likeness and 
a disparity in thefirst caseCOllSciOltSness judges thetatepower 
to be essentially different from it and the enjoyment of wealth 
to accord with its own nature while in the second case itjudgts 
the state power to Qcord  with its  nature and  the  enjoyment 
of wealth to beessentiaJly different from it We have before us 
a  twofold finding oflikenessanda twofold finding of qisparity 
an antithetical relation between the  two real essentialities  We 
must ourselves judge  these different judgements and  apply  to 
thtm the criterion set up According to this the conscious rela  
tionwhich finds likeness is the Good that whiehfinds disparity 
is the Bad and these two forms of the relation we are henceforth 
to  hold  fast  as  diverse  shapes  of consciousness  By  forming 
diverse  relationships  consciousness  itself comes  to  be  detercid
mined as  diverse as  being good or had not because it had for 
its  principle  either being  foritself or  pure  beinginitself  for 
both areequallyessentialrnoments In the twofold Judging eon  
sidered above the principles were thought of as  separate and 
therefore con tained merely abstract ways of judging Actual concid
sciousness  has  within  it  both  principles  and  the  distinction 

CULTURE 

between them falls solely within its own essence  viz  in the relacid
tion  of itself to  the  actual 

  There are  two  antithetical forms  of this  relation  one 
is a relationship to the state power and wealth as  to something 
ofike nature to itself the other as  to something disparate from 
it  The consciousness  which finds  them of like  nature  to  itself 
is noble  It sees in public authority what is  in accord with itself 
sees  in it its  own simple essence  and  the factual  evidence  of it 
and in the service of that authority its attitude towards it is  one 
of actual obedience nd respect Similarly in the case of wealth 
it sees  that  this  procures  for  it awareness  of its  other essential 
side the consciousness ofheingjor itself it therefore looks upon 
wealth likewise as essential in relation to itself and acknowledges 
the source of its enjoyment as a  benefactor to whom it lies under 
an  obligation 

  The consciousness  which adopts  the  other  relation  is 
on the contrary ignohle  It dings  to  the disparity between  the 
two essentialities  thus sees  in  the sovereign power a fetter and 
a  su ppres s ion of its  own heingforself  and  therefore hates   the 
ruler obeys only with a secret malice and is always on the point 
of revolt  ltsees  too  in  wealth  by  which  it  attains  to  the 
enjoyment of its ownselfcentred  existence  only the disparity 
with its permanent essence since through wealth it becomes concid
sciousofitselfmerely as an isolated individual  conscious  only 
ora transitory enjoyment  loving yet hating wealth  and with 
the  passing of the enjoyment  of something  that  is  essentially 
evanescent  it regards  its  relation  to  the  rich  as  also  having 
vanished 

  Now  these  relations  express  in  the first  instance  the 
judgement  the determination of what these two  essential  reai 
ties are as objects for consciousness not as  yet what they  are in 
and  for  themseIves  The reflection  which  is  presented  in  the 
judgement is  partly an  affirmation  of the  one  as  of the  other 
only jor us  and is  therefore  an  equal  annulling of both  it is 
not yet  the  reflection  of themfor  consciousness  itself  Partly 
at first  they simply are  essences  they have not become  such nor 
do they possess selfconsciousness that for which they are is Dot 
that which  animates  them  they  are  predicates which are not 
yet themselves subject On account of this separation the whole 
of the spiritual judgement falls  apart into two consciousnesses 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
each of which  is  subject  to  a  onesided  determination  Now 
just as at first the indiJIerence  of the  two sides of the alienationcid
one of which was  the initselfofpure consciousness viz  the specid
cific thoughts of Good and Bad  the other their existence  as  state 
power and wealthwas raised  into a  relation  between  them 
into a judgement  so  must  this  external  relation  be  raised  to 
an inner unity or to a relation of thought to actuality and the 
Spirit ofboth forms ofthejudgement must make its appearance 
This  happens  when  the judgement  becomes  a  syllogism  ie 
becomes the mediating process in which  the  necessity  and the 
middle  term of both sides  of the judgement come to view 

  The noble consciousness thus finds  itself  in  the judgecid

ment confronting the state power in such a way that the latter 
is  indeed not yet  a  self  but only  the universal  substance  it 
is  however conscious of being the essence of that substance its 
end  and  absolute  content  Being  so  poitively  related  to  it 
it adopts a  negative attitude  to  its  own ends  to its  particularcid
content and existence and lets them vanish This consciousness 
is the heroism of service  the virtue which sacrifices the single incid
dividual to the universal therehybringing this into existence 
the  person  one  who  voluntarily  renounces  possessions  and 
enjoyment and acts and is effective in the interests of the ruling 
power 

  Through this process the universal becomes united with 
exis tence in general just as  the merely existent consciousness 
through this  renunciation develops into an  essential  existence 
That from which  this  consciousness  alienates  itself in serving 
the  universal  is  the consciousness  that  is  immersed  in mere 
existence  but the being that is  alienated from  itself is  the  incid
itself  Through this development therefore it wins selfrespect 
and the respect of others The state power however which was 
at  first  only  the  universal  in  thovght  the  initsef  becomes 
through this very process the universal in existence actual power 
This it actually is  only  in  the  aetua  obedience  which  it gets 
through  self  consdousnes judging  the  state  power  to  be  the 
essence and through the free sacrifice of selfconsciousness to it 
This action which unites  the essence with the self produces the 
twofold actuality the self that has a  true  actuality and the state 
power as  the True which  is  acknowledged  as  such 

  Through this alienation however the state power is not 

CULTURE 

a selfconsciousness  that knows  itself as  state power  It is  only 
its law or its initself that has authority it has as yet no particular 
will  For the selfconsciousness  that serves the state power has 
not as yet renounced its  own  pure self and made  it the  active 
principle  of the state  power  it has  only given  that  power its 
mere being has only sacrificed its outer existence  to it not its  incid
trinsic  being  This  selfconsciousness is  deemed  to  be  in  concid
formity with the essence and is acknowledged on account ofwhat 
it intrinsically is  In it the others find  their own essence exemplicid
fied  but not  their  own  beingfor  selffind  their  thought  or 
pure  consciousness  fulfilled  but  not  their  individuality  It 
therefore possesses authority in their thoughts  and enjoys honour 
I t is  the haughty vassal who is active on behalf of the state power 
in so far as the latter is not a  personal will but an essential will 
the vassal who knows himself to be esteemed only in that honour 
only  in  the  essential  representation of him  in  general  opinion 
not in  the  gratitude  shown  to  him  by  an individuality for  he 
has not helped this individuality to gratify his beingforselj  Mis 
languagewere he tos tand lin relation to the state power which 
has  not yet  come  into  being  would  take  the  form  ofcfunsel 
imparted for  the general good 

  State power  therefore  still  lacks  a  will with which  to 
oppose counsel and the power to decide which of the different 
opinions is  best for the general good  It is  not yet a government 
and therefore not yet in truth an actual state power The beingcid
forself  the will  whichas will  is  not sacrificed  is  the inner 
separated Spirit of the  various  classes  and  estates  and  this 
in spite of its  chatter about the generalgood  reserves  to itself 
what suits its own best interest  and is inclined to make this chatcid
ter about the general good a substitute for action The sacrifice 
of existence which happen in the service of the state is indeed 
complete when it has gone  as  far as  death but the  hazard of 
death which the individual survives leaves him with a  definite 
existence and hence wi tha particular selfinterest and this  makes 
his counsel about what is  bestJor the general good ambiguous 
and open  to  suspicion  It  means  that  he  has  in  fact  reserved 
his own opinion and his own particular will in face of the power 
of the state  His conduct therefore conflicts with the interests 
of the state  and  is  characteristic  of the  ignoble  consciousness 
which is  always  on  the  point of revolt 

 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

  This  contradiction  which  beingforself  must  resolve 
that  of the  disparity  between  its  beingJorself  and  the  state 
power is  at the same time present in the following form  That 
renunciation of existence when it is  complete as it is  in death 
is simply a renunciation it does not return into consciousness 
consciousness does  not survive  the  renunciation  is  not  in  and 
for itself  but merely passes over into its  unreconciled opposite 
Consequently the true sacrifice of be ingforseif is solely that in 
which it surrenders itself as  completely as  in death yet in  this 
renunciationnoless preserves itself It thereby becomes in actu m 
ality what it is in itself becomes the identical unity of itself and 
of its opposed self  The separated inner Spirit  the self as  such 
having come forward  and  renounced itself  the state power is 
at the same time  raised  to  the  position  of having a  self of its 
own Without this renunciation of self  the deeds of honour the 
deeds of the noble consciousness and the counsels based on its 
insight would retain  the  ambiguity  possessed  by  that  private 
reserve  of particular intention and selfmwill 

  But this alienation takes place solely in language  which 
here appears in its  characteristic significance  In  the  world of 
ethical order in  law and command and in the actual world in 
counsel  only language has  the  essence for its  content and is  the 
form of that content  but here it has  for  its  content  the  form 
itself the form which language itself is  and is  authoritative as 
language  It is the power of speech  as that which performs what 
has  to  be  performed  For it is  the real  existence  of the pure self 
as  self in  spcech selfconsciousness  qua  independent separateincid
dividuality comes as such into existeoccso that it existsfor others 
Otherwise the this pure  I is  nonexistent is  not there  in 
evero  other expression it is  immersed in a  reality and is  ina 
shape from which it can withdraw itselfitis reflected backinto 
itselffrom its  action  as  well  as  from  its  physiognomic exprescid
sion and dissociates itself from such an imperfect existence in 
which there is  always  at once  too  Oluch  as  too little letting it 
remflin  lifeless  behind  Language  however  contains  it  in  its 
purity it alone expresses the  the I itself This real exis tence 
of the  I is  qua  real existence  an  objectivity  which  has  in  it 
the  true  nature  of the  The  is  this  particular  Ibut 
equally the universal I  its manifesting is also at once the extercid
nalization  and vanishing of this  particular I and  as  a  result 

CULTURE 

the  I remains  in  its  universality  The  I  that  utters  itself is 
heard or perceived  it is  an infection in which it has immediately 
passed into unity with those for whom it is  a real existence and 
is  a  universal  selfaconsciousness  That  it  is  perceived  or  heard 
means that its real existence dies  away  this its  otherness has  been 
taken  back into  itself  and its  real  existence  is  just  this  that 
as a selfconscious Now as a real existence it is not a  real existcid
Fnce  and  through  this  vanishing  it  is  a  real  existence  This 
vanishing is  thus itselfat once its abiding it is  its own knowing 
of itself and its knowing itselfas a self that has  passed over into 
another self that has  been  perceived  and is  universal 

  Spirit obtains this actuality here because the extremes 
of which it is  the  unity  are  also  directly  determined  as  being 
actualities on their own account Their unity is  broken up into 
two  rigid  unyielding sides  each of which  is  for  the  other an 
actual object excluded from it Conseq uendy the unity appears 
as  a  middle  term  which  is  excluded  and  distinct  from  the 
separated actuaLexistence of the sides  it has  therefore  itself 
an  actual  objective  existence  distinct  from  its  sides  and  has 
reality jor them  ie is something that exists  The spiritual sub  
stance enters as such into existence only when it has gained for 
its  two  sides  self  consciousnesses  which know  this  pure  self as 
an actual existence  having  immediate  validity  and in  knowing 
this are also immediately aware that they are such actual exist 
ences  only  through  the  mtdation  of  their  selfalienation 
Through that pure self  the  mOments  of substance  are  so  far 
purified  as  to  be  the  selfknowing  category  and  thus  to  be 
moments of Spirit  through this mediation Spirit comes to exist 
qua Spirit as a realityIt is thus the middle term which presupcid
poses  those  extremes  and  is  crea ted  by  their  eistenceb ut 
equally  it is  the  spiritual  whole  issuing  forth  between  them 
which sunders itselfintothem and only by means of this contact 
creates eachinto the whole in  terms  of its  own  principe The 
fact  that  both  extremes  are  already  implicitly  reduced  to 
moments and setapart produces their unity and this is the procid
cess which brings both into a  unity interchanges their determicid
nations  and  unites  them in each  extreme  This  mediation  thus 
posits  the  Notion  of each  of the  two  extremes in its  actuality 
or makes  what each is  in  itself into its  Spirit 

   The  two  extremes  the  state  power  and  the  noble 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

 
consciousness are split up by the latter the state power into the 
abstract  universal  which  is  obeyed  and  into  the  selfcentred 
will which however does not yet conform to the universal and 
the noble consciousness into the obedience rendered by the excid
istence which is  not selfcentred or the intrinsic  being  of selfrecid
spect and  honour  and into  the  still  unsurrendered  beingfor  
self  the  will  that  still  reserves  its  independence  The  two 
moments into which both sides are purified and which  therecid
fore  are moments of language are the abstract  universal  called 
the general good  and the pure  self which in serving the state 
renounced its own many and various interests Both are essenticid
ally  the  same for  pure self is just the  abstract  universal  and 
consequently their unity is expressed as  their middle term  But 
theselfisatfirst actual only in consciousness in the one extreme 
while  the initself is  actual  only  in  the  s ta te  power  the  other 
extreme What consciousness lacks is  the actual  transference  to 
itofthestatepower not merely in the form of honour and what 
is  lacking in the state  power is  that it should  be obeyed  not 
merely as  the socaled  general  good  but as  will  Of  that it 
should endow  the  self with  the  power of decision  The  unity 
of the  Notion  in  whichthe state  power still  stands  and  into 
which consciousness  has  been purified  becomes actual  in  this 
process of mediation  thesimple existence of which as middle  term 
is  language  Howeyer  the sides  of the  unity are not yet selves 
which exist as selves for thestae power has yet to be energized 
into a self  This language is  therefore  Itot yet Spirit that com 
pletely knows  and expresses itself 

 I  I  The noble consciousness being the extreme which is the 
self appears as  the source of the language  by which  the sides 
of the relation are shaped into animated wholes  The heroism 
ofsilentservice becomes the heroism of flattery  This vocal recid
flection of service constitutes the spiritualselfseparating middle 
term and reflects  back into itself not only its  own extreme but 
also reflects backinto this self the extreme of universal  power 
making that power which is at first only implicit into a power 
that is explicit with an existence of its own  makes it into a self  
consciousindividuaity The result is thattheSpirit of this power 
is  now an  unlimited monarch  unlimited  because  the  language of 
flattery  raises  this  power  into  its  purified  universality  this 
moment being the  product of language of an  existence  which 

CULTURE 

has  been  purified  into  Spirit  is  a  purified  selfidentity  a 
monarch  for  such  language  likewise  raises  individuality  to  its 
extreme point what the noble consciousness divests itself of as 
regards  this aspect of the simple spiritual unity is  the  pure  incid
trinsic being of its thinking its very Expressed more definitely 
it raises  the individuality which otherwise is  only a  presulned 
existence  into  the  existence  of its  pure  form  by  giving  the 
monarch his  own proper name  for it is in the name alone  that 
the difference of the individual from everyone else is not presumed 
but is  made actual  by all  In the name  the  individual counts  as 
a pure individual no longer only in his  own consciousness  but 
in  the  consciousness  of  everyone  By  his  name  then  the 
monarch is  absolutely separated off from  everyone else exclucid
sive and solitary as monarch he is  a  unique atom that cannot 
impart any of its  essential nature  This name is  thus  the refleccid
tionintoself or the actuality  which the  universal  power has  in 
its owrz self  through the nme the power is  the monarch  Concid
versely he  this  particular individual  thereby knows  himself 
this individual to be the universal power knows that thenobles 
not only  are  ready and  prepared for  the  service  of the  state 
power but that they group themselves round the throne as  an 
ornamental setting  and that they are continually telling him who 
sits  on it what he  is 

  The language  of their  praise  is  in  this  way  the  Spirit 
that in the state power itself uni tes the two extremes It reflects the 
abstract power into itself and gives t the moment of the other 
extreme the beingforselfthatwills and decides and by so doing 
gives it a  selfconscious existence  or otherwise  expressed  this 
individual actual selfconsciousness attains to the certain  knowcid
ledge of itself as  the power of the s ta te  I t is  the point of the self 
into which the many points or selves  through renouncing their 
own inner certainty are fused into one Since however this Spirit 
proper  of state  power  consists  in  its  obtaining  actuality  and 
nourishment from  the  sacrifice  of action and  thought  by  the 
noble consciousness it is  an independence that is selfalienated  the 
noble consciousness  the extreme of heingJorself  receives back 
the other extreme  that of actual  universality  in  return for  the 
universality of thought which it relinquished the power of the 
state has passed to  the noble consciousness  In it  that power is 
first  made  truly  effective  in  the  beingforself  of  the  noble 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
consciousness it ceases to be the inert entity which it appeared to 
be  as  the  extreme of abstract  beinginitself  Considered  as  it 
is in itself state power that is reflected into itself or has become 
Spirit simply means that it has  become a  moment of selfconcid
sciousness ie it exists only as superseded  Consequently it is now 
essence in the form of something the Spirit of which is  that it 
is to be sacrified and surrendered ie it exists as wealth It does 
indeed at the same time have a continuing existence as a reality 
visavis weal th into which it is ever changing in accordance with 
its  Notion  but it is  a  reality whose  Notion is just this  process 
of passing overby way of the service  and  honour done  to it 
and from which it derives its  existenceinto its  opposite  into 
the  relinquishment of power  Thus  the  peculiar self that is  its 
will knows that through the debasement of the noble consciouscid
neSs  it has  become  a  universality  that  renounces  itself  has 
become  a  completely  separate  and  contingent  individuality 
which  is  at  the  mercy  of every  more  powerful  will  What 
remains to it of universally  acknowledged and incommunicable 
independence is the empty name 

S   While therefore the noble consciousness hehaves as  if 
it wereconjorming to the universal  power  the truth about it is 
rather that in its  service it  retains  its  own  beingforself  and 
that in  the genuine renunciation of its  personality it actually 
sets aside and rends in pieces the universal Substance Its Spirit 
is  a  completely disparate relationship  on  the one hand ioits 
position of honour it retains its  own  will on  the  other  hand 
it gives up its will butin so doing it in part alienates itself from 
its own inner nature and becomes utterly at variance with itself 
and in part subjects to itself the universal substance and makes 
it completely at variance with itself  It is  dear that as  a result 
the specific character which it was judged to have in comparicid
son  with  what was  called  the  ignoble  consciousness  has  discid
appeared and with it theJatter too  The ignoble consciousness 
has  achieved  its  purpose  viz  to  bring  the  universal  power 
under the  con trol  of beingfarself 

  Selfconsciousness  thus  enriched  by 

the  universal 
power exists as universal beneficence oris wealth which is itself 
in turn an object for consciousness  For although wealth is for 
consciousness  the deposed universal  the latter has not yet by 
this  first  subjection  returned  absolutely into  the  self  The  self 

CULTURE 

has not yet for object itself qua  self  but  the subordinated  unicid
versal essence  Since this object has only just come into being 
consciousness has formed an immediate relation with it and thus 
has  not  yet  exhibited  its  disparity  with  it  we  have  here  the 
noble consciousness which preserves its beingfarself in the unicid
versal  which  has  become  unessential  and  therefore  acknowcid
ledges  the object and is  grateful  to  the  benefactor 

S I   Wealth already contains within it the moment of beingcid
forself  It is  not  the selfless  universal  of state  power  or  the 
nalve  inorganic nature  of Spirit it is  s tate  power which wills 
to  hold its  own against  those  who would take  possession  of it 
for their own enjoyment But since wealth has merely the form 
of essence  this onesided beingforself which has  no intrinsic 
being of its  own  but  is  rather  the  cancelling  of it  is  in  its 
enjoyment theessenceless return of the individual into himself 
It therefore itself requires  to  be ensouled  and the  movement 
of its reflection consists inlhis that wealth which is only for itself 
develops an intrinsicheing ofles own  that instead ofheing a cancid
celled essence  it develops an essential  being  It  thus  receives 
withinitselfa Spiritofitsown Since the form of this movement 
has already been setforth in detail it issufficienthere tocharaccid
terize its  content 

   The noble consciousness then is not related here to the 
object as  an essence in general on the contrary what is  alien 
to it is  its  ownbeingforself  ItJinds  confronting it its own  but 
alienated selfas such in the shape of an objective fixed reality 
which  it has  to  receive  from  another fixed  beingforself  Its 
object is a beingfarself ie its own beingfarself but because 
itis an object it is  at the Same time  ipso facto  an alien  reality 
which  has its  own  beingfor  selfwhich has  a  will  of its  own 
ie it seesselfin the power ofan alien willon which it is depencid
dent for  possession of its  own self 

 I   Selfconsciousness  can  make  abstraction  from  every 
particular aspect and for  that reason even when it is  tied  to 
one of them it retains  the  recognition  and  intrinsic  validity  of 
itselfas an independent being  Here  however  as  regards the 
aspect of that pure actuality  which is  its  very own  viz  its  own 
 it finds  that it is  outside  of itself and  belongs  to  another 
finds  its  personality  as  such  dependent  on  the  contingent  percid
sonality of another on the accident ofa moment on a caprice

Wealth thus shares its dejection with the recipient but in place 
of rebellion appears arrogance For in one respect it knows  as 
well  as  the  recipient  that heingforself is  a  contingent  Thing 
but it is itself this contingency in the power of which personality 
stands  In this arrogance which fancies  it has  by the gift of a 
meal acquired the self of anothers and  thereby gained for 
itself the submission  of that others inmost being  it overlooks 
the inner rebellion  of the other it overlooks  the  fact that all 
res train ts  have  been cast off  overlooks  this  s ta te  of sheer  discid

become divided against itself all identity all existence is  discid
rupted and in which the sentimentand viewpoint of the benecid

  Just as  sef  conscioUSless  had  its  own  language  with 
state powef inothr words just as  Spirit emerged as  actively 
mediating between these extremes so also has sef  consciousness 
its ownJanguage in dealing with wealth but still more so when

significance and  thereby gains  possession  of it  is  likewise  the 
language offla ttery hu t ofhase flattery for what it pronounces 
to be an essence  it knows to he expendable to be without any 
intrinsic  being  The language of flattery  however  as  we  have 
already observed is Spirit that is  still onesided  For although 
its  moments are indeed the self which  has  been  refined by the 
discipline of service into a  pure existence and the intrinsic being 
of power yet the pure Notion in which the simple unitary self 
and  the initselj  the former a  pure  I and  the latter this  pure 
essence  or thought  are  the  samethis unity  of the  two  sides

an intrinsic  heing in contrast to  the self  that is  the  object  is  not 
for  consciousness  at the  same  time  consciousnesss  own  self as 
such The language of this disrupted consciousness is  however 
the  perfect language  and  the  authentic  existent  Spirit  of this 
entire  world  of culture  This  self  consciousness  which  rebels 
against this  rejection of itself is  eo  ipso  absolutely selfidentical 
in its  absolute disruption the pure mediation of pure selfconcid
sciousness with itself  It is  the sameness  of the  identical judgecid
ment in which one and the same personality is both subject and 
predicate But this identical judgement is  at the same time  the 
infinite judgement for this personality is absolutely dirempted 
and subject  and  predicate  are  utterly  indifferent  immediate 
beings which have nothing to do with one another which have 
no necessary unity so much so that each is  the power of a separcid
ate  independent  personality  The  beingforself of this  COncid

the content is  the same selfintheform of an absolute antithesis 
and a  completely indifferent existence orits own  Here then 
we  have  the Spirit of this  real world of culture Spirit  that is 
conscious  of its elf in its  truth  and in its  Notion 

 I  ltis this absolute and universalinversion and alienation 
of the  actual world and of thought  itls pure  culture  What  is 
learnt in  this  world is  that  neither  the  actuality  of power and 
wealth nor their specific  Notions  good and bad or the concid
sciousness  ofgood and bad  the noble and  the  ignoble concid
sciousness  possess  truth on  the  contrary  all  these  moments 
become inverted one changing into the other and each is  the 
opposite of itself  The  universal power  which is  the  Substance 
when it acquires a spititualnature of its  own through the princid
ciple  of individuality  receives  itsownself merely  asa name 
and  though it is  the  actuality  of power  is  really  the  powerless 
being that sacrifices  its  own self  But this  expendable  selflss 
being or the self that has  become a Thing is  rather the return 
of that heinginto itself it is  beingforself that is  explicitly for 
itself  the concrete existence of Spirit  The thoughts of these  two 
essences ofgood and bad are similarly inverted in this move

CULTURE 

ment what is characterized as good is bad and vice versa The 
consciousness  of each  of these  moments  the  consciousnesses 
judged as  noble  and ignoble  are  rather in  their  truth just  as 
much the reverse of what these characterizations are supposed 
to  be  the  noble consciousness  is  ignoble  and  repudiated just 
as the repudiated consciousness changes round into the nobility 
which characterizes the most highly developed freedom of selfcid
consciousness  From  a  formal  standpoint  everything  is  ot  
wardly  the  reverse  of what it  is  for  itself  and  again  it  is  not 
in  truth what it is  for  itself  but something else  than  it wants 
to be being  forselfis rather the loss of itself and its selfaliena  
tion rather the preservation of itself  What we  have here  then 
is  that  all  the  moments  execute  a  universal  justice  on one 
another  each just as  much  alienates  its  own  self  as  it forms 
itselfinto its  opposite  and in  this  way  inverts  it  Tnle  Spirit 
however is just this  unity of the absolutely separate moments 
and indeed  it is just through  the  free  actuality  of these  selfcid
less extremes that as  their middle term it achieves  a concrete 
existence  It exists in the universal talk and destructive judge  
ment which strips of their significance all those moments which 
are supposed to count as the true being and as actual members 
of the whole and is  equally this  nihilistic game which it plays 
with itself  This judging and talking is  therefore  what is  true 
and invincible while it overpowers everything it is  solely with 
this  alone  that one  has  truly to  do  with  in  this  actual  world 
In  this  world  the  Spirit  of each  part  finds  expression  or is

individual takes each momentto bean abiding essentiality and

  The content of what Spirit says about itself is  thus  the 
perversion of every Notion and reality the universal deception 
of itself and others and the shamelessness which gives utterance

no more than taciturn for to the latter it can say nothing that 
it does  not already know  and say  If it gets  beyond speaking 
in monosyllables it says  therefore  the same thing that is  said 
by the  educated mind  but in  doing so  also  commits  the folly 
of imagining it is saying something new and different  Its very 
words shameful ignoble are already this folly for  the  other

all that is  unequivocal because what is  selfidenticalis only an 
abstraction but in its actual existence is in its own self a pervercid
sion The plain mind on the other hand takes under its proteccid

its utterance in the only way here possiblethat is  to say  the

it imagined it was  contradicting what was  said  has  in doing 
so  merely condensed into a  trivial form  the content of Spirits 
utterance  in  making  the  opposite  of the  noble  and  good  into 
the condition and necessity of the noble and good it thoughtlessly 
supposes  itself to  be  saying something else  than  that  what  is 
called noble  and  good is  in its  essence  the  reverse  of itself  or 
that  conversely  the  bad is  the  excellent 

  If  the  simple  consciousness  compensates  for 

this 
dull  uninspired  thought  by  the  actuality  of  the  excellent  by 
adducing an example of the latter either in the form of a fictitious 
case  or  a  true story  thus  showing  that it is  no  empty  name 
but  actually  exists  the  universal  actuality  of  the  perverted 
action stands opposed to  the whole of the real world in which 
the  said  example  constitutes  something  quite  single  and 
separate an espece  a  mere sort of thing and to  represent the 
existence  of  the  good  and  noble  as  an  isolated  anecdote 
whether fictitious  or  true  is  the  most  disparaging  thing  that 
can be said  ahoutit  Finaly should the  plain  mind  demand 
the  dissolution  of this  whole  world  of  perversion  it  cannot 
demand of the indiVcidual that he remove himself from it for even 
Diogenes  in  his  tuh  is  conditioned  by  it  and  to  make  this 
demand  of the individual is just what is  reckoned  to  be  bad 
viz  to care for himself qua individual But if the demand for  this 
removalisdirected to the universal individuality it cannot mean 
thatReasonshould give up again the spiritually developed concid
sciousness  it  has  acquired  should  submerge  the  widespread 
wealth of its  moments  again  jn  the simplicity  of the  natural 
heart and relapse into the wilderness of the nearly animal concid
sciousness  which  is  also  called  Nature  or  innocence  On  the 
contrary the demand for this dissolution can only be directed 
to  the Spirit of culture itself  in  order  that it return  out  of its 
confusion  to itself as  Spirit and win for itself a still higher concid
sciousness 

  But in  point  of fact  Spirit  has  already  accomplished 

this  in  principle  The  consciousness  tha t  is  a ware  of its  discid
ruption and openly declares it  derides existence and  the  unicid
versal  confusion  and derides  its  own  self as  well  it is  at the 
same  time  the fading  but still  audible sound of all  this  concid
fusion  This  vanity  of all  reality  and  every  definite  Notion 
vanity which knows  itself to  be  such  is  the  double  reflection 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

 
of the real world into  itself  once  in  this  particular  self of concid
sciousness  qua  particular and again in  the  pure  universality  of 
consciousness  or in  thought  In  the first  case  Spirit  that  has 
come to itselfhas directed its gaze to  the world of actuality and 
still has  there  its  purpose  and immediate content  but in  the 
other case its gaze is in part turned only inward and negatively 
against it and in part is  turned away from  that world towards 
heaven  and its  object is  the  beyond of this  world 

  In that aspect of the return into the self  the  vanity of 
all  things  is  its  own  vanity it is  itself vain  It is  the self  centred 
self that knows not only how to pass judgement on and chatter 
about everything but how to give witty expression  to  the concid
tradiction thatis present in the solid elements of the actual world 
as  also in the fixed  determinations posited by judgement and 
this  contradiction  is  their  truth  Looked  at from  the  point  of 
view  of form  it knows  everything to  be  selfalienated  beingcid
forself is  separated from  beinginitself  what  is  meant  and 
purpose are separated from  tru th  and from  both  again  the 
beingforanother the ostensible meaning from  the real meancid
ing from the true thing and intention  Thus it knows  how to 
give correctexpression to each moment in relation to itsoppocid
site  in  general  how  to  express  accurately  the  perversion  of 
everything it knows better than each what each is  no matter 
what its specific nature is  Since it knows  the substantial from 
the side  of the  disunion and conflict whkh are  united  within 
the  substantial  itself  but not  from  the  side  of this  unioo  it 
understands verywell how to pass judgement on it but has lost 
the ability to comprehend it  This vanity at the same time  needs 
the vanity of all things in order to get from them the conscious  
ness of self it therefore creates this vanity itself and is  the soul 
that supports it  Power and wealth are the supreme ends of its 
exertions  it knows  that  through  renunciation  and  sacrifice  it 
forms itselfinto the universal attains to the possession of it and 
in this  possession is  niversaUy recognized and accepted state 
power and wealth are the realand acknowledged powers How  
ever this recognition and acceptance is itself vain and jus t by 
taking possession of power and wealth itknows them to be withcid
out a self of their own  knows  rather that it is  the  power over 
them while  they are vain  things  The  fact  that  in  possessing 
them it is  itself apart from  and  beyond  them  is  exhibited  in 

CULTURE 

 
its  witty  talk which  is  therefore  its  supreme  interest and  the 
truth of the whole relationship In such talk this particular self 
qua this pure self determined neither by reality nor by thought 
develops  into  a  spiritual  self that  is  of truly  universal  worth 
It is the selfdisruptive nature of all relationships and the  concid
scious  disruption  of  them  but  only  as  selfconsciousness  in 
revolt is it aware of its own disrupted state and in thus knowing 
it has immediately risen  above  it  In  that vanity  all  content 
is  turned  into  something  negative  which  can  no  longer  be 
grasped as  having a  positive significance  The  positive  object 
is  merely  the pure  P  itself  and  the  disrupted  consciousness  in 
itself  this  pure  selfidentity  of  selfconsciousness  that  has 
returned  to  itself 

b  Faith  and pure  insight 

  The  Spirit  of self  alienation  has  its  existence  in  the 
world  of culture  But since  this  whole  has  become  alienated 
from  itself  there stands  beyond  that world  the  unreal  world 
of pure  consciousness  or of thought  Its  content  is  in  the  form  of 
pure thought and thought is its absolute element  Since  how 
ever  thoughtis  in  the  first  instance  only  the element  of this 
world consciousness only has  these thoughts  but as yet it loes 
not think  them or is  unaware that they are thoughts they exist 
forconsciollsness in the form of picturethoughts  For it steps  out 
of its actual world into pure consciousness yet is itselfgenerally 
still in  the sphere of the actual world and its  determinateness 
The disrupted  consciousness  is  only in  itself  or implicitly  the 
selfidentity of pure consciousness a fact that is known to us  but 
not to  itself  Thus it is  only the immediate elevation of itself  an 
elevation it  has  not yet accomplished  within itself  and it still 
has within it its  opposite  principle  by which it is  conditioned 
without  having  become  master  of it  through  the  movement 
ofmeciiation  Consequenty  the essence  of its  thought has for 
it the value of essence  not  merely  in  the  form  of the  abstract 
initself  but in  the  form  of a  common  actuality  of an actuality 
that has merely been raised into another element without hlvcid
ing lost  therein the specific character of an actuality that does 
not exist merely in thought I t is essential to  distinguish it from 
the inMitselfwhich is the essence of the Stoic consCiousness What 
counted  for  the  latter  was  merely  the form  of thought  as  such 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
which  besides  has  any  alien  content  taken  from  the  actual 
world Whatcoun ts however for the consciousness we are dealcid
ingwith is not theform of thought  This too is essentially distinct 
from the initself of the virtuous consciousness for which lssence 
though  it stands  in  a  relationship  to  the  actual  world  and  is 
the essence of the actual world itself yet is initiallya nonactual 
essence In the consciousness under discussion essence although 
lying beyond the actual world none the less counts as an actual 
essence  In the same way what is  intrinsically right and  good 
in the  sphere  of legislative  Reason  and  the  universal  that is 
adopted by consciousness in testing laws these also do not pos 
sess  the  character of actuality  Therefore whlIe  pure  thought 
fell within the world of culture itself as an aspect of the alienacid
tion  viz  as  the  standard  for  judging  Good  and  Bad  in  the 
abstract  through  having  passed  through  the  process  of  the 
whole  it has  become enriched with  the  moment  of actuality 
and  thereby with  content  Bt  this  actuality  of the  essence  is 
at the same  time only an actuality of pure  not of actual  concid
sciousness although it is  raised into the element of thought it 
does  not yet eount as  a  thought for  this  actual consciousness 
rather it lies  for  the  latter  beyond  its own  ac tuality  for  it  is 
the flight from  this  actuality 

  Religiortfor it is obviously religion  that we are speakcid

ing  aboutin theorm in which  it appears  here  as  the  faith 
belonging to  the world of culture  does  not yet appear as  it is 
in and for itself We have alreadyseenit in other characteristic 
forms  viz  as  the  Unhappy  Consciousness  as  a  shape  of the 
insubstantial process ofconsciousness itself  It made its appearcid
ance too  in the ethical Substance as  faith  in  the  underworld 
though consciousness of the departed spirit is strictly speaking 
notfaith not essence posited in the element of pure consciouscid
ness beyond the actual world but has itself an immediate precid
sence its elementis the family  Here however religion in part 
has proceeded from  the Substance  and is  the pure consciousness 
ofit in part this pure consciousness is alienated from its actual 
consciousness  the  essence  from  its  existence  True  it is  thus  no 
longer the insubstantial process of consciousness but it still has 
the characteristic of an antithesis  to actuality as  this actuality 
in general and of an antithesis  to selfconsciousness in particucid
lar  I t is  therefore essentially  merely  a  belief 

CULTURE 

  This  pure  consciousness  of absolute  Being is  an  alienated 
consciousness We have now to look more closely at the specific 
nature of that of which it is  the  other and we  must consider 
it only in connection with this other To begin with this  pure 
consciousness  seems  to  have  over  against  it  only  the  world  of 
actuality but since it is  the flight from this world and therefore 
has the character of an antithesis to it it bears this world within 
itself  pure consciousness  is  therefore  in its  own  self alienated 
from  itself  and faith  constitutes only one  aspect  of it  At  the 
same time the other aspect has already come to view  Pure concid
sciousnes namely is  reflection out of the world of culture in 
such  a  way  that  the  Substance  of that  world  and  also  the 
masses or groups into which it is  articulated are shown to  be 
what  they  are  in  themselves  spiritual  essentialities  absolutely 
restless processes or determinations which are directly cancelled 
in  their opposite  Their essence  simple  consciousness  is  thus 
the simplicity of absolute difference which isat once no difference 
Consequently it is pure beingJorself  not as  this single  self but 
as the immanently universal self in the form of a restless  process 
which attacks and pervades  the  passive  essence of the  matter 
in  hand  In it is  thus  to  be  found  the  certainty  that at once 
knows  itself to be the truth pure thought as  the ahsolute  Notum 
in the might of its negativity which eliminates everything objeccid
tive  that  supposedly  stands  over  against  consciousness  and 
makes it into a being which has its origin in consciousness This 
pure  consciousness  is  at  the  same  time  equally  simple  just 
because its difference is no difference But as this form of simple 
reflectionintoself  it  is  the  element of faith  in  which  Spirit 
has  the  determinateness  of positive  universality  of beinginitself 
in contrast  to  that  beingforself of selfconsciousness  Forced 
hack into itself out of the essenceless  merely dissolving  world 
Spirit in  accordance with its  truth  is  in an  undivided  unity 
at once the absolute movement and negativity of its process of manicid
festation as well as its inwardly satisfied essence and its  positive 
repose  But  coming  generally  under  the  determinateness  of 
alienation  these  two  moments fall  apart into  a  dual consciouscid
ness  The former  is  pure  insight  as  the  spiritual  process  which 
focuses itself in selfconsciousness a process which is confronted 
by consciousness of what is  positive  the form  of objectivity or 
of  picturethinking  and  which  turns  against  it  but  pure 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

insights own object is only the pure  The simple consciousness 
of the  positive  or of tranquil selfidentity on  the other hand 
has for its object the inner essence  qua essence  Pure insight has 
therefore  in  the  first  instance  no  content of its  own  because 
it is  negative  beingforself  to  faith  on  the other  hand  there 
belongs a  content but without insight  If the former  does  not 
step outside selfconsciousness  the latter certainly has  its concid
tent  in  the  element  of pure selfconsciousness  but in  thought 
not  in  Notions  in  pure  consciousness  not  in  pure  selfconsciousness 
Hence faith is certainly pure consciousness of essence ie of the 
simple  inner  being  and  thus  is  thoughtthe  cardinal factor  in 
the nature of faith which is  usually overlooked The immediacy 
of the  presence of essence in it is  due to  the fact  that its  object 
is  essence  ie  pure  thought  This  immediacy  however  so  far  as 
thoughtenters into consciousness or pure consciousness enters into 
selfconsciousness acq uires the significance of an objective being 
which lies  beyond  the  consciousness  of the self  It is  through 
this  significance  which  the  immediacy  and  simplicity  of pure 
thoughtohtains in consciousness  that the essence  of faith  is  no 
longer a pure thought but is reduced to the J evel of something 
imagined and becomes a supersensihle world which is  essenti  
ally an ther in relation to selfconsciousness  In pure insight 
on the other hand thetransitionofpure thought in to consciouscid
ness has the opposite determination  objectivityhas the significid
cance of a merely negative content a content which is  reduced 
to a  moment and returns into the self  that is  to say  only the 
selfis really the object of the self or the object only has truth so 
far  as  it has  the form  of the self 

  Just as faith and pure insight belong in common to  the 
element of pure consciousness so also are they in cornmon the 
return  from  the  actual  world  of culture  Oonsequently  they 
present themselves according to  three aspects  First each is an 
intrinsic  being  on  its  own  account  apart  from  all  relationships 
second each stands in relationship with the actual world in an 
antithesis  to  pure  consciousness  and  third  each  is  related 
within pure consciousness  to  the other 

 I  In  the  consciousness  of the heliever  the  aspect  of being 

in andjor itselfis its absolute object whose content and determicid
nation we already know  For according to  the Notion of faith 
it is nothing else butthe actual world raised into the universalit 

CULTURE 

of pure consciousness The articulation of this world  therefore 
constitutes  the  organization of the world of faith  except  that 
in the latter the parts do not alienate themselves in their spiri 
tualization but are Beings  each with an existence of its  own 
Spirits  which  have  returned  into  themselves  and  abide  with 
themselves  The  movement  of  their  transition  into  one 
another  is  therefore  only for  us  an  aliena tion  of the  specific 
character in which they exist in their distinctiveness and is only 
for us a  necessary series for faith  however  their difference  is  a 
tranquil  diversity and  their movement a  real  happening 

  To name them briefly according to  the external deter 
mination  of their  form  just as  in  the  world  of culture  state 
power or the Good was primary so  here  too  the first  is  the 
Absolute  Being  Spirit  that  is  in  and for  itself in  so  far  as  it is 
the  simple  eternal  substance  But  in  the  actualization  of  its 
Notion in  being Spirit  it passes  over into beingforanother  its 
selfidentity becomes an actual  selfsacrificing absolute Being it 
becomes a self buta mortal perishable self  Consequently the 
third  moment  is  the  return  of this  alienated  self and  of the 
humiliated substance into their originalsimplicity only in this 
way is  substance represented  as  Spirit 

  These distinct Beings when brought hack to themselves 
by thought out of the flux  of the actual world are immutable 
eternal Spirits whose being lies in thinking the unity which they 
constitute Removed thus from selfconsciousness  these Beings 
are nevertheless actively present in it for if the absolute Being 
were  to  remain  unmoved  in  the  form  of the first  simple  subcid
stance  it would  remain  alien  to  selfconsciousness  But  the 
externalization of this  substance  and  then its  Spirit  involves 
themomen t of actuali ty and thereby makes itself a  participant 
in  the selfconsciousness of the  believer  or  the  believing  concid
sciousness  belongs  to  the actual world 

  According  to  this  second  relationship  the  believing 
consciousness partly has its actuality in the real world of culture 
and constitutes the Spirit and the existence of that world which 
we  have  already  considered  partly  however  the  believing 
consciousness  confronts  this  its  own  actuality  as  something 
worthless and is  the process of overcoming it This process does 
not  consist  in  the  believing  consciousness  making  brilliant 
remarks aboutthe perversion of its real world for it is the simple 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

naive  consciousness  which  reckons  such  brilliance  as  vanity 
since it still has the real world for its  purpose On the contrary 
contrasted with the tranquil realm of its thought the real world 
is  a  soulless  existence  which  therefore  has  to  be  overcome  in 
an external  manner  This  obedience  of service  and  praise  by 
setting  aside  senseknowledge  and  action  produces  the  concid
sciousness  of unity  with  the  absolute  Being  though  not  as  a 
unity  that is  actually  perceived on  the  contrary  this  service 
is only the perpetual process of producing that unity a  process 
which  does  not completely attain its  goal in  the  present  The 
religious community it is true does so for it is  universal selfcid
consciousness  hut  for  the  individual  selfconsciousness  the 
realm of pure though t necessaril y remains a beyond of its actual 
world or since  this  beyond through the ex ternalization of the 
eternal Being has entered the actual world the actuality is  an 
uncornprehendeci  sensuous  actuality  But one  Sensuous  actucid
ality remains indifferent to the other and the beyond has only 
received the further character of remoteness in space and time 
The Notion however  the  actuaHty  of Spirit present  to  itself 
remains in the consciousness ofthebeliever the inner being which 
is  everything and  which  acts  but does  not  itself come  forth 
  In pure Insight  however the N olion is alone the actual 
and this third aspect of Faith that of being an object for  pure 
Insight is really the true relation in which Faith here appears 
Pure Insight itself like Faith is  to be considered partly in and 
for  itself  and  partly in its  relationship  to  the  actual  world  so 
far as  this  is  still present in a  positive form  viz  as  a  vain  concid
sciousness and lastly in that relation to faith mentioned above 
  We have seen what pure insight is in  and for itself  As 
faith  is  the tranquil pure consciousness  of Spirit as  essence  so  is 
pure insight the selfconsciousness of Spirit as essence it therecid
fore knows essence not as essence  but as  absolute self  It therecid
fore seeks toaholish every kind of independence other than that 
of selfconsciousness  whether it  be  the  independence of what 
is  actual or of what possesses intrinsic  being and  to  give  it  the 
form of Notion  Pureinsight is not only the certainty of selfconcid
scious  Reason that it is  all  truth it knows  that it is 

  However in the form in which the Notion of pure incid
sight first  makes  its  appearance  it is  not yet realized  Accordcid
ingly  its  consciousness still  appears  as  contingent  as  single  and 

CULTURE 

separate  and  its  essence  appears  for  it  in  the  form  of an  end 
which it has to realize It has to begin with the intention of makcid
ing pure insight universal ie  of making everything that is  actual 
into a Notion and into one and  the same Notion in every selfcid
consciousness  The intention is pure  for  it  has  pure insight for 
its  content  and  this  insight  is  likewise pure  for  its  content  is 
solely  the absolute Notion which meets with no  opposition in 
an object nor is  it restricted in its  own self  In the unrestricted 
Notion there are directly found the two aspects that everything 
objective has  only the significance of beingjorselj  of selfconcid
sciousness and that this has  the significance of a  universal  that 
pure insight is  to become the property of every selfconsciouscid
ness  This second aspect of the intention is  a  result of culture 
in so  far  as  in  this  culture  the  difference  of objective  Spirit 
the parts and the determinations which its judgement imposed 
on the orld as well as the differences which appear as natural 
predispositions  have  all  been  upset  Genius  talent  special 
capacities generally belong to  the world of actuality in so  far 
as this world still contains the aspect of being a spiritual animal 
kingdom in which individuals amid confusion and mutual viocid
lence chea Land struggle over the essence of the actual world 
These differences his tru have no place in this world as honest 
especes  individ uality neither is contented with the unreal matcid
ter  in  hand  itself  nor  has  it  a  particular  content  and  ends 
of its own On the contrary it counts merely as something unicid
versally acknowledged viz  as  an educated individuality and 
the difference is red uced toone of less or more energy a quantitacid
tive  difference  Le  a  nonessential  difference  This  last  difcid
ference however has been effaced by the fact that in the comcid
pletely  disrupted  state  of  consciousness  difference  changed 
round  into  an absolutely  qualitative  difference  There  what 
isfor the an other is only the I itself In this infinite judgecid
ment all  onesidedness  and  peculiarity  of the  original  beingcid
for  self has  been eradicated  the self knows  itself qua  pure self 
to be its own object and this absolute identity of the two sides 
is  the element  of pure insight  Pure insight  is  therefore  the 
simple immanently differentiated essence  and equally the unicid
versal work or achievement and a  universal  possession In  this 
simple spiritual substance self  consciousness gives itselfand precid
serves for itself in every object the consciousness of this its own 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

particular  being  or  of  its  own  action  just  as  conversely  the 
individuality  of selfconsciousness is  therein  selfidentical  and 
universal  This pure insight is  thus the Spirit that calls to every 
consciousness  be jor yourselves  what  you  all are  in  yourselvescid
reasonable 

II  THE  ENLIGHTENMENT 

  The peculiar object against which  pure insight directs 
the power of the Notion is faith  which is  the form of pure con 
sciousness  confronting it in the same  element  But it also  has 
a  relation  to  the  actual  world  for  like  fai th  it  is  the  return 
from  the  actual world into pure consciousness  We have first 
of aU  to  see  the  nature of its  activity as  it is  directed  against 
the impure intentions and perverse insights of the actual world 
  We have already mentioned the tranquil consciousness 
that stands opposed to  this  turmoil which having once settled 
down starts  up all  over  again  it constitutes  the  side  of pure 
inightand intention This tranquil consciousness  however as 
wesgw has no special insight into the world of cuI tun this latter 
has itseLratherthe mostpainfulfeelingiand  the  truest insight 
about itself  the feeling that all its defences have hroken down 
that every part of its being has heen  tortured on  the rack  and 
every  bone  broken it is  also the language of this  feeling  and 
the brilliant talk which pronounces judgement on every aspect 
of its  condition  Here  therefore  pure  insight  can  have  no 
activity and  content  of Its  own  and  thus  can  only  behave as 
the formal  and faithful  pprkension of its own  hrilliant insight 
into the worldandofits own peculiar language Since this  lan

CULTURE 

  
  The relation of pure insight to the naive  consciousness 
of absolute Being now has a  twofold aspect  On the one hand 
pure insight is itself the same as that consciousness On the other 
hand this naive consciousness gives complete liberty to absolute 
Being as well as to its parts in the simple element of its thought 
and  allows  them  to  subsist  there  and  to  be  valid  only  as  its 
implicit  being  and  hence  to  be  objectively  valid  but  in  this 
implicit being it renounces its  own  beingforself  In so  far  as 
according to the first aspect this faith is for pure insight in  itself 
pure selfconsciousness  and has only  to become  this  explicitly 
for  itself  pure  insighthas  in  this  Notion of selfconsciousness 
the element in which  instead  of false  insight  it realizes  itself 
  Since from this aspect both are essentially the same and 
the relation of pure insight takes place through and in the same 
element the communication between them is  direct and  their 
giving  and  receiving is  an  unimpeded  flow  of each  into  the 
other  Whatever wedges  of any sort may  be  driven  into  concid
sciousness it is in  itself this simplicity in which everything is discid
solved  forgotten  and  unbiased  and  which  therefore  is  absocid
lutely receptive  to  the  Notion  It is  on  this  account  that  the 
communication of pure insight is comparable to a silent expancid
sion or to the dijJusion say of a perfume in the unresisting atmocid
sphere It is a  penetrating infection which does not make itself 
noticeable beforehand as something opposed to the indifferent 
elementinto which it insinuates itself  and therefore cannot be 
warded off  Only when  the infection  has  become  widespread 
is  that  consciousness  which  unheedingly  yielded  to  its  influcid
ence aware oit For though the nature of what consciousness 
received  into  itself was  simple  and  homogeneous  with  it  yet 
it was  also  the simplicity  of an  introreflected  negativity  which 
subsequently  also  develops  in  keeping  with  its  nature  into 
something opposed to it and thereby reminds  consciousness of 
its  previous state  This  simplicity  is  the  Notion  which  is  the 
simple  knowing  that  knows  itself and  also  its  opposite  but 
knows this opposite to be reduced to a  moment within it  Concid
sequently when consciousness does  become aware of pure incid
sight  the latter is  already widespread  the struggle against  it 
betrays the fact that infection has occurred  The struggle is  too 
late and  every  remedy  adopted  only  aggravates  the  disease 
for it has laid hold of the marrow of spiritual life viz  the Notion 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

  
of consciousness  or  the  pure  essence  itself  of consciousness 
Therefore too  there is  no power in consciousness which could 
overcome the disease Because this is present in the essence itself 
its  manifestations  while still  isolated  can  be  suppressed  and 
the superficial symptoms smothered  This  is  greatly  to  its  ad 
vantage for it does  not now  squander its  power or show  itself 
unworthy of its  real nature  which  is  the  case  when  it  breaks 
out in symptoms and single eruptions antagonistic  to  the con  
ten t of fai th and to its connection with  the reality of the world 
outside of it Rather being now an invisible and imperceptible 
Spirit it infiltrates  the  noble  parts  through and  through  and 
soon has taken complete possession of all the vitals and members 
of the unconscious idol then one fine morning it gives its com 
rade a shove witH  the elbow and bang  crash  the idol lies  on 
the floor  On  one  fine  morning  whose  noon  is  bloodless  if 
the  infection  has  penetrated  to  every  organ  of spiritual  life 
Memory alone then still preserves the dead form of the Spirits 
previous shape as  a  vanished history vanished one knows  not 
how And the new serpent of wisdom raised on high for  adoracid
tion  has  in  this  way  painlessly  cast  merely  a  withered skin 

  But  this  silentceaseless  weaving  of the  Spirit  in  the 
simple inwardness of its substance Spirit concealing its  action 
from  itself  is  only one side of the  realization  of pure  insight 
Its  diffusion  consists  not  merely  in  the  fact  that  like  goes 
together with like nor is  its actualization merely an expansion 
in which  there is  no antithesis  On  the  contrary the action  of 
the negative essence is  no less  essentially  a  developed  selfdifcid
ferenting  movement which  being  a  conscious  act  must  give 
its  moments a  definite manifest existence  and  must appear on 
the scene as a sheer uproar and a  violent struggle with its anti 
thesis 

  W e have  therefore  to see  how pure  insight  and  intention 
behaves in its negave attitude to that other which it finds con 
fron ting it Pure insigh t and in ten tion which takes up a nega tive 
attitude  can  only  besince  its  Notion  is  all  essentiality  and 
there is nothing outside of itthe negative of itself  As  insight 
therefore it becomes the negative of pure insight becomes uncid
truth and unreason and as  intention it becomes the negative 
of pure intention becomes a  lie and insincerity of purpose 
 Diderots  Nlphew  of Rameau 

CULTURE 

 

  It entangles itself in  this contradiction through engagcid
ing in dispute and imagines  that what it is  attacking is  Somecid
thing other  than itself  I t only  imagines  this  for  its  essence  as 
absolute  negativity  implies  that  it  contains  that  otherness 
within  itself  The  absolute  Notion  is  the  category  in  that 
Notion  knowing  and  the  object  known  are  the  same  Concid
sequently what pure insight pronounces  to  be its  other  what 
it asserts to be an error or a lie  can be nothing else but its own 
self it can condemn only what it is  itself  What is  not rational 
has no truth or what is not grasped conceptually is  not  When 
therefore Reason speaks of something other than itself it speaks 
in  fact  only of itself  so  doing  it does  not go  outside  of itself 
This struggle with its antithesis  therefore also  has  the significid
cance of being the actualization  of insight  For this  consists pre m 
cisely in the process of developing the moments and taking them 
back into  itself  One part of this  process  isthe  differentiation 
in  which intellectual insight confronts its  own self as  object  so 
long as  it persists in  this relationship it is  alienated from itself 
As pure insight itisdevoid dfaB content the process of its realiza 
don consists in its makingitselJ i ts con ten t for nothing else can 
become  its  content  because  it  is  the  seW conscious ness  of the 
category But since in confronting the content pure insight at 
first knows itonlyas a content and not yet as  its own self it does 
not recognize itselfin it  Complete insight is therefore attained 
when  the  content which  to  begin with was  objective  to  it  is 
recognized as  its own  Its result however will thus  be neither 
the  re  establishment  of  the  errors  it  struggles  against  nor 
merely its original Notion but an insight which recognizes  the 
absolute negation of itself to be its own actual existence  to  be 
its own sefor an insight whose Notion recognizes its own self 
This nature of the struggle of the Enlightenment with errors 
that offighting itselfin them and of condemning in them what 
it itself asserts is explicitfor us  or what Enightenmen and its 
struggle is in itself  It is  the first aspect of this struggle however 
the  defilement of Enlightenment through the  adoption  by  its 
selfidentical purity of a  negative attitude  that is  an  object for 
faith which therefore comes to know it as falsehood  unreason 
and  as  illintentioned just as  Enlightenment  regardsfaith  as 
error and prejudice As  regards its content it is  in  the first  incid
stance an empty insight whose content appears to it to be some

 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

thing other than itself conseq uently itjindsit given in the shape 
of a  content which is  not yet its  own  as  something that exists 
quite independently of it finds  it given  in faith 

  The  way  therefore  in  which  Enlightenment  appre 
hends its object in the first instance and generally is  that it takes 
it as pure insight  and not recognizing itself therein  declares  it 
to  be  error  In  insight  as  such  consciousness  apprehends  an 
object in such a  way  that it becomes  the essence  of consciouscid
ness  or becomes an object which  consciousness  permeates  in 
which  consciousness  preserves  itself  abides  with  itself  and 
remains  present to itself  and since  it is  thus  the  movement of 
the object brings it into existence It is just this that Enlighten 
ment rightly  declares  faith  to  be  when  it says  that  what  is 
for faith the absolute Being is a Being of iti  own consciousness 
is its own thought something that is a creation of consciousness 
itself  Thus what  Enlightenment  declares  to  be  an  error and 
a  fiction  is  the  very  same  thing  as  Enlightenment  itself is 
Enlightenment that wants to  teach faith  the new wisdom does 
not teU  it  anything new  for  its  object is  also  for  it just  this 
viz  a  pure esence  of its  own  cOQsciqusness  so  that this  concid
sciousness  does  not  take  itself to  be  lost  and  negated  in  that 
object  but rather puts  its  trust in it  ie  it  finds  itself as  this 
particular consciousness or as  selfconsciousness precisely in  the 
object  Whomsoever I  trust  his  certainty  oj himself ii  for  me  the 
certainty  oj myself  I  recognize  in  him  my  own  being  forself 
know  that he acknowledges  it  and  that  it is  for  him  purpose 
and essence Trust however is faith because the consciousness 
of the believer is  directly  rellted to its object and is  thus  also  in 
tuitively aware  that it  is  one  with  it and  in  it  Further  since 
what is  object or me is  that in which I recognize myself  I  am 
for myselfat the same time in that oQject in the form of another 
selfconsciousness  ie  one  which  has  become  in  that  object 
aHenated from its particular individuality viz from its  natural 
and contingent existence but which partly remains therein sef 
consciousness partly in that object IS an essential consciousness 
just as  pure insight is  The Notion of pure insight implies not 
merely  that consciousness  recognizes itself in  the  object  of its 
insight and is  immediately  present in it without first  leaving the 
element of though t and returning into itself it also implies that 
consciousness is aware of itself as being also the mediating move

CULTURE 

 

ment  aware  of itself as  being  the  activity  of producing  the 
object  This unity of itself as  unity of self and object is  thereby 
explicit for it in  thought  Faith  too  is just this  consciousness 
a bedience  and  action  form  a  necessary  momen t  through 
which  the  certainty  that absolute  Being is  comes  about  This 
action of faith  does  not  indeed  make  it appear  as  if absolute 
Being itself is  produced  by it  But the absolute  Being of faith 
is  essentially  not  the  abstract  essence  that would  exist  beyond 
the consciousness of the believer on the contrary it is  the Spirit 
of the  religious  community the unity of the abs tract essence 
and selfconsciousness That it be the Spirit of the community 
this  requires  as  a  necessary  moment  the  action  of the  comcid
munity It is  this  Spirit only  by  being produced by consciousness 
or rather it does not exist as the Spirit of the community without 
havingbeen produced by consciousness  For essential as  is  the 
producing of it  this  is  equally essentially not the sole  ground 
of absolute Being but only a  moment Absolute Being is  at the 
same  time in and for  itself 

  On the other side  the Notion of pure insight is  somecid

thing other to itself than its own object for it is just this negative 
determination thatconstitutes the object Thus from the other 
side  it also  declares  the essence of faith  to  be somethirig alien 
to consciousness  to be not its  essence  but a  changeling foisted 
on it But here Enlightenment is  foolish faith  regards it as  not 
knowing what it is  saying  and as  not  understanding  the  real 
facts  when it talksahout priestly deception and deluding  the 
people It talks aboutthisasifbysome hocuspocus of conjuring 
priests consciousness had been palmed off with something absocid
lutely alien andolher  to it in  place of its own essence  and at 
the same time it says  that this  is  an  essence  of consciousness 
that consciousness believes in it puts its trust in it  and seeks  to 
make  it  favourably  disposed  towards  itself  ie  consciousness 
beholds in it its pure  essence just as much as  its  own single  and 
universal  individuality  and  through  this  action  produces  this 
unity of itself with its  essence  Thus what it asserts  to  be alien 
to  consciousness  it directly declares  to  be  the  inmost  nature  of 
consciousness itself How then can it possibly talk about deception 
and delusion Since in the same voice it asserts the veryoppocid
site of what it maintains regarding faith  it really reveals  itself 
to  faith  as  the conscious  lie  How  are  delusion  and  deception 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
to  take  place where consciousness  in  its  truth  has  directly the 
certainty of itself where in its object it possesses  its own self since 
it just as  much  finds  as  produces  itself in  it  The  distinction 
no longer exists even in words If the general question has been 
propounded whether it is  permissible  fa delude a  people the 
answer would in fact have to  be that the question is  pointless 
because it is impossible to deceive a people in this matter Brass 
instead of gold counterfeit instead of genuine moneymay well 
be  passed  off in  isolated  cases  many  may  be  persuaded  to 
believe that a battle lost was a  battle won and other lies about 
things of sense and isolated happenings may be made credible 
for a time but in the knowledge of that essential being in which 
consciousness  has  the  immediate certainty  of itself  the  idea  of 
delusion  is  quite out of the question 

  Let us see further how faith experieuGes  the Enlighten M 
ment  in  the  diJIerent  moments  of  its  own  consciousness  to 
which  the  view  mentioned  above  referred  to  only  generally

CULTURE 

 
of faith  It condemns  this  picturethought  and  in  it its  own 
object But in apprehending the object of faith as insights own 
object it already does  faith  a  wrong  For it is  saying  that the 
absolute Being offaith is a piece of stone a  block or wood which 
has eyes and sees not or again a  piece of dough which having 
come  from  the  field  is  transformed  by  man  and  returned  to 
earth again  or  in  whatever  other  ways  faith  anthropomorcid
phizes  absolute  Being  making  it  into  an  object  that  it  can 
represen t  to  itself 

  Enlightenment which  professes  to  be  pure  here  concid

verts  what  is  for  Spirit  eternal  life  and  Holy  Spirit  into  an 
actual perishable thing  and defiles it with sensecertaintys view 
of it  a  viewpoint  which  is  essentially  trivial  and  definitely 
absent from faith in its worship so that Enlightenment is  comcid
pletely in  the wrong when it imputes  this  view  to faith  What 
faith  reveres  it certainly does  not regard  as stone or wood  or 
dough  nor  any  other  kind  of  temporal  sensuous  thing  If 
Enlightenment has a  mind to say that all  the same  its  object 
is  also  this or even that it is  essentially and in truth  this  then 
firs tly fai th is eq ually well aware of that also which however 
lies  ou tside  of its  worship  secondly  however  faith  does  not 
regard such  things  as  stones  etc  as  possessing  intrinsic  being 
on the contrary what has jntrinsic being for faith  is  solely  the 
esential being of pure  though t 

  The second moment is the relation offaith to this absocid
lute Being as a consciousness that knows it For faith asa think  
ing  pure consciousness  this  Being is  immediately  present  but 
pure consciousness isjut as much a mediated relation of certainty 
to  truth  a  relation  w hieh  constitutes  th ground  of faithF Df 
Enlightenment this ground becomes equally a fortuitous knowcid
ledgifortuitous events But the ground of knowledge is  the concid
scious  universal  and  in  its  truth  is  absolute  Spirit  which  in 
abstract pure  consciousness  or  in  thought as  such  is  merely 
a bsoluteBeing but qua  selfconsciousness is knowledge of itself 
Pure insight characterizes  this  conscious  universal  the  simple 
selfoknowing Spiriteq ually as a negative of selfconsciousness  It 
is  true that pure insight is itself pure  mediated  ie  selfmediated 
thought is  a  pure knowing but since it is  a pure  insight  a pure 
knowing  that does  not as  yet know itself  Le  is  not aware  that 
it is  this  pure  mediating  movement  the  mediation seems  to

B 
insight as does everything that is itselfinsight to be an other 
In its  realization  therefore  it develops  this  moment which is 
essential  to  it  but this moment seems  to  it to  belong  to  faith 
and to have the character of something external to pure insight 
to  be a  fortuitous  knowledge  of narratives of real events  real 
in  the  ordinary  sense  of the  word  Here  therefore  it  falsely 
charges religious beliefwith basing its certainty on some particucid
lar historical evidences which  considered as  historical evidences 
would  certainly  not  guarantee  the  degree  of certainty  about 
their  content  which  is  given  by  newspaper  accounts  of any 
happeningfurther  that its  certainty rests  on  the  accidental 
preservalionofthese evidences on the one hand the preservation 
by  means of paper  and  on  the other  hand  by  the  skill  and 
honestyoftheir transference from one piece of paper to another 
and lastly  on  the  correct  interpretation  of the  meaning of dead 
words and letters  In  fact  however  it does  not occur to faith 
to fasten its certainty to such evidences and such fortuitous circid
cumstances  Faith in  its certainty is  an  unsophisticated  rela  
tionship to its absolute object a pure knowing of it which does 
not mix  up letters  paper  and copyists  in its  consciousness  of 
absolute  Being and does  not bring itself into  relation  with it 
by means of things of that kind On the contrary thisconsclouscid
ness  is  the selfmediating ground of its  knowledge  it is  Spirit 
itself which bears witness  to  itself both in the inwardness of the 
individual  consciousness  and  through  the  universal  presence  in 
everyone  of faith  in it  If faith  wants  to  appeal  to  historical 
evidences in order to  get  that kind  of foundation  or  at least 
confirmation  of its  content  that Enlightenment  talks  about 
and seriously  thinks  and acts  as  if that were  a  matter  of im  
portance  then  it  has  already  let  itself be  corrupted  by  the 
Enlightenment  and  its  efforts  to  establish  and  consolidate 
itself in such a  way are  merely evidence it gives of its  corrupcid
tion  by  the  Enlightenment 

  There still remains the third side  the  reLaonto  absolute 
Being of consciousness as action  This action is  the settingaside  of 
the  particularity of the individual or of the  natural  mode of 
its  being  forself  whence  proceeds its  certainty  of being  pure 
selfconsciousness of being  in accordance  with  its  action  ie 
as an independent inpividual one with absolute Being  Since in 
action purposiveness and End are distinguished and pure insight 

CULTURE 

 
in relation to  this  action  equally adopts  a  negative  attitude  and 
as in the other moments denies its own self  it must as  regards 
purposiveness exhibit itself as lacking in in telligence since insigh t 
united  with  intention  ie  the  harmony  of End  and  Means 
appears to  it as  an other or rather as  the opposite of insight 
as  regards  the  Enn  itself  however  it  has  to  make  badness 
enjoyment and possession its  End and so prove itself to  be the 
impurest kind of intention since pure intention qua  other is 
equally  impure intention 

  Accordingly  we  see  that  as  regards  purposzveness 
Enlightenment finds it foolish  when  the  believer gives  himself 
the superior consciousness  of not being in bondage to natural 
enjoyment  and  pleasure  by  actually  denying  himself  natural 
enjoyment and pleasure and demonstrating by his actions that his 
contempt for them is no lie but is genuine Similarly Enlighten 
ment  finds  it foolish  that  the  individual  absolves  itself of its 
quality of being absolutely individual excluding all others and 
of possessing property ofits own by itself giving up its property 
for  thereby it shows  in  truth  that it is  not in  earnest with  this 
isolation  of itself  hut is  raised  above  the  natural  necessity  of 
isolating  itself  and  in  this  bsolute isolation  of beingforself 
denying that others are the same as itself  Pure insight finds both 
to be of no purpose as well  as  wrong  the  purpose of showing 
oneself to  be  free  of pleasure  and  possession  is  not served  by 
denying oneself pleasure and giving away a  possession  in the 
opposite case therefore it will declare the man a  fool  who in 
order to eat has recourse to actually eating  Insight also finds 
it  wrong  to  deny  oneself a  meal  and  to  give  away  butter and 
eggs not for  money nor money for butter and eggs but simply 
to give them away without receiving anything in return it de  
dares  a  meal  or  the possession  of things  of that sort  to  he  an 
End in itself and hence in fact declares itself to be a very impure 
intention which treats such enjoyment and possession assome 
thing wholly essential Again it also affirms as a  pure intention 
the necessity  of rising above  natural existence  above acquisicid
tiveness  about the  means  of existence  only  it finds  it foolish 
and wrong that this elevation should be demonstrated by  deeds 
in other words  this pure insight is in truth a deception which 
feigns  and demands an  inner  elevation  but declares  that it is 
superfluous foolish  and even  wrong to  be  in  earnest  about it 

C  RB  SPIRIT 

to  put this  elevation into actual practice  and demonstrate  zts  truth 
Pure insight thus denies itselfboth as  pure insightfor it denies 
directly purposive actionand as pure intentionfor it denies 
the intention of proving itself freed from the Ends of a separate 
individual  existence 

  It is  thus  that Enlightenment lets  itself be  understood 
by faith It presents itselfin this bad light because just by being 
in relation to an other it gives itselfa negative reality or exhibits 
itself as the opposi te ofi tself but pure insigh t and inten tion m us t 
enter into this  relationship  for  it  is  their  realization  This  at 
first  appeared  as  a  negative  reality  Perhaps  its  Positive  reality 
is  better constituted  Let  us  see  how  things  stand with  this  If 
all prejudice and superstition have been banished the question 
arises  What  next  What  is  the  truth  Enlightenment  has  propagated 
in  their stead  It has already declared  that this  positive  content 
is  in its  extirpation of error  for  that alienation  of itself is  Just 
as  much its  positive reality  In its approach to what for  faith 
is absol uteS piri t i tin terprets an y determinateness i tdiscovers there 
as wood stoneetc as particular realthings Since in this way 
it  grasps  in  generalevery  determinateness  ie  all  content  and 
filling as somethingfinite asa human entity and mere  idea absocid
lute Being becomes for it a  vacuum  to which no determinations 
no predicates can be attributed  Theattrihution of predicates 
to such a vacuum would be in itselfreplehensible and it is just 
in such a union that the monstrosities ofsuperstition have been 
produced Reasonpure insightis certainly not empty itself since 
the negative of its elf isJor it and is its content on the contrary 
it is  rich  but rich only in particularity and limitations  To let 
nothing of that sort appertain to absolute Being or be attributed 
to it this is  the prudent behaviour of Reason  of pure insight 
which knows how to put itselfand its finite riches in their proper 
place and how to deal with  the Absolute in a  worthy manner 
  In  contrast  to  this  empty  Being  there  stands  as  the 
second  moment  of the  positive  truth  of Enlightenment  the 
singleness in general of consciousness and of all being a singleness 
excluded from  absolu te  Being and in  the form  of absolute heingcid
inandJor  itselj  Consciousness  which in its  very first  reality is 
sensecertainty and  mere  meaning  returns  here  to  this  from 
the whole course of its experience and is  again a  knowledge  of 
what is purely  negative  of itself  or of things  oj sense  ie  of things 

CULTURE 

  
which  immediately  and  indifferently  confront  its  beingJorselj 
Here however it is not an immediate  natural consciousness on 
the contrary it has become such for itself Whereas at first it was 
at  the  mercy of every sort of entanglement into  which  it was 
plunged by its  unfolding and now  has  been led  back by  pure 
insight to its  first shape it has experienced that shape as  result 
Being based on  the  nothingness  of all  the  other shapes  of con m 
sciousness and hence of everything beyond sensecertainty this 
sensecertainty is no longer mere meaning but rather absolute 
truth  This  nothingness  of everything  that  lies  beyond  sensecid
certainty is no doubt merely a negative proof of this  truth but 
it is not susceptible of any other For the positive truth of sense m 
certainty  is  in  its  own  self the  immediate  beingforself of the 
Notion itself qua object and that too in the form of othernesscid
the  positive  truth  that every  consciousness  is  absolutely  certain 
that it is  and that there are other real  things outside of it and 
that in its  natural  being it  like  these  things  is  in  and for  itself 
or absolute 

  Lastly the third moment of the truth of Enlightenment is 
the  relation  of the individual  being  to  absolute  Being  is  the 
relation  between  the first  two  moments  Insight  qua  pure incid
sight of what is  identical or unrestricted  also  goes  beyond  what  is 
not identical viz  beyond finite reality or beyond itselfas mere 
otherness  For  the  beyond  of this  otherness  it  has  the  vmd  to 
which therefore it relates the sensuous reality  In the determicid
nation of this relation  both of the  sides  do not enter as  content 
for  one  of them is  the  void  and it is  only  through  the  other 
the sensuo us  reality  that a  con ten t is  present  But the form  of 
the  relation  to  the  determination of which  the side of the  inM 
itself con tri b u tes can be a matter of choice for the form is somcM 
thing intrinsically negative  and therefore self  opposed  being as 
well as  nothing the inself as  well as  its opposite  or what is  the 
same  thing  the  relation  of the  actual  world  to  the  in aiself qua 
a beyond is as  much a negating as  a positing of that actual world 
Finite reality can  therefore  properly speaking  be  taken just 
as  one needs  The sensuous  is  therefore  now  related positively 
to the  Absolute as  to  the  initself  and sensuous reality is  itself 
an intrinsic  being  the Absolute  makes it  fosters  and  cherishes 
it  Then again it is  related to  the Absolute  as  an opposite  as 
to  its  own  nonbeing  in  this  relationship  it  is  not  anything  in 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
itself  but exists only for  an  other  Whereas  in  the preceding 
shape of consciousness the  Notions  of the antithesis were detercid
mined as Good and Bad in the case of pure insight on the other 
hand they become the purer abstractions  of beinginitself and 
being foran  ther 

  Both ways of viewing the positive and the negative relacid

tions  of the finite  to  the initself are  however  in fact  equally 
necessary  and everything is  thus  as  much  something  in  itself 
as it ifor an other  in other words everything is  useful  Every  
thing is  at the mercy of everything else  now lets  itself be used 
by  others and iior them  and  now  so  to  speak  stands  again 
on its  hind  legs  is  standoffish  towards  the other  is  for  itself 
and  uses  the  other  in its  turn  From  this  we  see  what is  the 
essence and what is  the place of man regarded as  a Thing that 
is  conscious  of this relation  As  he immediately is  as  a  natural 
consciousness per se  man is good  as an  individual he is  absolute 
and  all else  exists  for  him  and  moreover since  the  moments 
have for him qua selfconscious animal the significance of un icid
versalityeverything  exists  for  his  pleasure  and  delight  and  as 
one who has  come from  the hand of God  he walks  the earth 
as in a garden planted for him He must also have plucked the 
fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil He possesses 
in  this  an advantage which distinguishes  him  fromaH  other 
creatures for  it  happens  that  his  intrinsically good  nature is 
also  so  constituted  that an excess  of pleasure does it harm  or 
rather  his  individuality  has  also  its  beyond  within  it  can  go 
beyond itselfand destroy itself  To counter this  Reason is  for 
him a  useful instrument for keeping this excess within bounds 
or rather for preserving himself when he oversteps his limit for 
this  is  the  power of consciousness  Enjoyment  on  the part  of 
the  conscious  intrinsically  universal  being  must  not  itself be 
something determinate  as  regards  variety  and  duration  but 
universal  Measure or proportion has  therefore  the  function 
of preventing pleasure in its  variety  and duration from  being 
cut short ie  the function  of  measure is  immoderation Just 
as  everything  is  useful  to  man  so  man  is  useful  too  and  his 
vocation is  to make himselfa member of the group  of use  for 
the common good and serviceable to all  The extent to  which 
he  looks after his  own interests  must  also  be  matched  by  the 
extent to which he serves others  and so far as he serves others 

CULTURE 

 
so far is  he  taking care Df himself  one hand washes  the Dther 
But wherever he finds  himself  there  he is  in  his  right  place 
he  makes  use  Df Dthers  and is  himself made use  Df 

 I  Different things are useful  to  Dne  another in different 
ways but all things are mutually serviceable through their own 
nature viz through being related to the Absolute in two ways 
the  one  positive  whereby  they  exist  entirely  on  their  own 
account the other negative whereby they exist for others The 
relation  to absolute  Being  or religion  is  therefore  of all  useful 
things the supremely useful for it is  pure utility itself it is this 
enduring being of all things or their being  inandJorthemselves 
and it is  their downfall  or their beingJoranother 

  To faith of course this  positive outcOffle of Enlightencid
ment  is  as  much  an  abomination  as  its  negative  attitude  to  
wards  belief  This  enlightened  insight  into  absDlute  Being 
which sees nothing in it but just absolute Being  the Jtre  supreme 
or the voidthis intention to regard everything in its immediate 
existence  as  havingintrinsic  being  or  as  good  and  finally  to 
regard the relation of the individual conscious  being to absolute 
Being  religion  as  exhaustively  expressed  in  the  Notion  of 
utilityall this is for faith utterly detestable This wisdom  pecucid
liar  to  Enligh tenment  at  the  same  time  necessarily  seems  to 
faith  to  be  undiluted platitude  and  the  confession  of platitude 
because  it consists  of knowing  nDthing  of absolute  Being  Df 
what amounts to the same thing in knDwing this quite flat trucid
ism about it just that it is only absolute Being and on the other 
hand in knowing only what is  finite  and  morepver  knowing 
it as truth and thinking that this know ledge of the finite as true 
is  the highes t  knowledge  attainable 

  Faith  has  the  divine  right  the  right  of absolute  selfcid
identity  or  of  pure  thought  as  against  Enlightenment  and 
receives at its hands nothing but wrDng for Enlightenment discid
torts  all  the  moments Df faith  changing them into something 
different from what they are in it  But Enlightenment has only 
a  human  right  as  against  faith  and  for  the  support  of  its 
own truth for the wrong it commits is  the right to be nonidenti
cal  and  consists  in  perverting  and  altering  a  right  which 
helongs to the nature of selfconsciousness as  against simple essencid
tial being or thought  But since the right of Enlightenment is  the 
right of selfconsciousness  it  will  not  only  also  retain  its  own 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
right so that two equal rights of Spirit could be left confronting 
each other neither being capable of satisfying the other it will 
maintain  its  absolute  right  because  selfconsciousness  is  the 
negativity of the Notion a negativity which is  active  not only 
on  its  own  account  but which  also  takes  within  its  grasp  its 
opposite And because faith  itself is  a consciousness  it will  not 
be  able  to  deny  Enlightenment its  right 

  For Enlightenment does not employ principles peculiar 
to itself in its  attack on faith  but pdnciples which are implicit 
in faith itself  Enlightenment merely presents faith with its  own 
thoughts which faith  unconsciously lets  fall  apart  but which 
Enlightenment brings tagether it merely  reminds faith  when 
ane afits own modes is  present to  it af the athers which it also 
has but which it always forgets when the other one is  present 
Enlightenment shows  itself to faith  to  be  pure  insight  by  the 
fact  that  in  a  specific  moment  it sees  the  whole  brings  forcid
ward the other moment which is opposed to it and canverting 
one into the other brings to notice the negative essence af both 
thaughts the Notian To faith it seems  to be a perversion and 
a lie because it points out the otherness afits moments in doing 
so  it seems directly  to  make something else  out of them than 
they arein theirseparatenessbut this other is equally essential 
and in truth is present in the believing consciousness itself only 
this does not thinkabout it but puts it away somewhere  Concid
sequently it is  neither alien  to faith  nor can faith disavaw it 
  Enlightenment itself  however  which reminds faith of 
the appasite apect of its separated moments is just as little en
ightened abaut itself  It has  a  purely negative  attitude  to  faith 
so  far  as  it excludes  its  own  content from  its  purity and takes 
that content to be the negative of itself It therefore neither recogcid
nizes itself in this negative in the content af faith  nar for  this 
reasan does it bring the two  thaughts  together  the  one which 
it puts forward itself  and the one to  which it appases the first 
Since it does  not recognize  that what it candemns  in  faith  is 
directly its own thought it is  itself in  the antithesis of the  twa 
maments anly one of whichviz in every case the one oppased 
tofaithorit acknawledges but separates the ather fram the first 
just as  faith  does  Consequently Enlightenment does  not procid
duce the  unity af both as  their unity  ie  the  Notion  but the 
Nation comes  into  being for it af its  own  accard  in other wards 

CULTURE 

 

Enlightenmentfinds the Notion there merely as something given 
For in itself the realization of pure inigh t is just this  that in  
sight whose essence is  the Notion at first becomes for itself an 
absolute other and repudiates itselffor the  antithesis  of the 
Notion is  an absolute antithesisand then out of this otherness 
it comes  to  itself  or to its  Notion  But  Enlightenment is  onlycid
this  movement  it is  the still  unconscious  activity  of the  pure 
Notion  an  activity which  though it does  arrive  at its  object 
takes it to be an other and too does not know the nature of the 
Notion  viz  that  it  is  the  undifferentiated  which  absolutely 
sunders itself  As  against faith  then insight is  the might of the 
Notion in so  far  as  it is  the  movement and  the  relating of the 
moments lying asunder in its consciousness a relating in which 
their contradiction comes to light Herein lies the absolute right 
of the authority which insight exercises over faith but the reality 
on which it exercises  this authority lies just in the fact that the 
believing consciousness is  itself the Notion and therefore  itself 
acknowledges  the opposite   aspect  which insight  puts  before 
it  Insight thereforeretains its  right as  against faith  because it 
makes valid in aithwhat is  necessary  to  faith  itself and what 
faith  possesses in itself 

  At  first  Enlightenment  affirms  this  moment  of  the 

Notion that it is  an act of consciousness  opposing faith  it maincid
tains that the absolute Being offaith is  a Being of the  believers 
own  consciousness  qua  a  self  or  thatthis  absolute  Being  is  a 
product  of consciousness  To faith  its  absolute  Being  while  it 
is  possessed ofintrinsic being for  the believer is  also at the same 
time not like an alien thing which is just found in him no one 
knowing how and whence it came  On  the  contrary  the faith 
of the believer consistsjust in hisfinding himsefas this particular 
personal consclousnessin the absolute Being and his obedience 
and service consist in producing  through his own activity  that 
Being as his own  absolute Being  Enlightenment strictly speakcid
ing only reminds faith of this if faith  rounclly  asserts  that the 
initseIJofabsolute Being is beyond the activity of consciousness 
But while Enlightenment it is  true corrects  the onesidedness 
offaith by bringing to its notice the opposite moment of apt ion 
in contrast to beingand it is  being which faith is  alone thinking 
Ofhereand yetdoes not itself bring its own thoughts together 
it isolates the pure moment of action  and asserts  that the initself 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

of faith is  only  a  product  of consciousness  This  action  taken  in 
isolation and opposed to the initself  is  however  a  contingent 
action and qua  an activity of picturethinking is  a  creating of 
fictionspicturethoughts which possess no intrinsic being and 
this  is  how  Enlightenment  regards  the  content  of faith  But 
conversely pure insight equally says  the reverse  In maintaincid
ing the moment of utherness  which  the  Notion has  within  it  it 
pronounces  absolute  Being to  be  for  faith  something which 
in no way concerns  consciousness  lies  beyond it  is  alien  to it 
and unknown The case is similar with faith  On the one hand 
it puts its  trust in  absolute Being  and in  doing so  obtains  the 
certainty of itself on the other hand for  faith  absolute  Being 
is  unsearchable in  all  its  ways  and in  its  Being  unattainable 
  Further Enlightenmentmaintains against the believer 
a right which the latter himself concedes  when Enlightenment 
regards  the  object  of the  believers  veneration  as  stone  and 
wood  or else  as  something  fini te  and  an thropomorphic  For 
since this consciousness is  divided within itself  having a  beyond 
of the real world anda world that is  altogether  this  side  of the 
world beyond  thereis as  a  matter of fact  also present in  it this 
view of the thing of sense according to which it counts as a being 
that is  in lnd  for itself hut faith does not bring together these 
two thoughts of absolute Being which is  for it at one time pure 
essence  and at another time  an ordinary thing  of sense  Even its 
pure consciousness  is  affected  by  the  latter view  for  the  dif 
ferences  of the supers en sible world because this is  without the 
Notion are a series of independent shapes and their movement 
is  a  happening  ie  they  exist  only  in  picturethinkingand  have 
within  them  the marks  of sensuous  existence  Enlightenment 
on  its  side  equally isolates  the actual  world as  an entity forcid
saken  by  Spirit  isolates  deteuninateness  as  unmoved  finicid
tude as  if it were not even a  moment in the spiritual movement 
of essential  being  not  nothing  but  also  not  something  that 
absolutely  is  but something that is  evanescent 

  I t  is  clear that the  same is  the case  with  the ground  of 
knowledge Faith itself acknowledges a  contingent knowledge 
for i has a relationship to contingent things and absolute Being 
itself exists  for  faith  in  the  form  of a  pictorial  representation 
of a  common  reality  Consequently  the  believing consciouscid
ness too is  a certainty which does not possess  the truth within 

CULTURE 

 
itself and it confesses itself to be such an unessential consciouscid
ness  to  be  of this  world  and separated from  the  Spirit  that  is 
certain  of itself  and 
selfauthenticated  But  it  forgets  this 
moment in its immediate spiritual knowledge of absolute Being 
Enlightenment  however  which  reminds  it of this  in  its  turn 
thinks  only  of contingent  being  and  forgets  the  otherthinks 
only of the mediation which takes  place through an alien  third 
term not of the mediation in which the immediate is  itself the 
third term through which it mediates itself with the other viz 
with  its  own  self 

 Finally Enlightenment in its view of the action  of faith 

finds the rejection oenjoyment and possessions wrong and purcid
poseless  As  to  the  rejection being wrong  Enlightenment is  in 
agreement with faith on this point for faith itself acknowledges 
tuis reality of possessing holding on to and enjoying property 
In  holding  on  to  property  its  behaviour  is  all  the  more  selfcid
centred  and stubborn  and in its  enjoyment it is  all  the  more 
crudely selfabandoned since its religious act of giving up  possescid
sions and enjoyment falls on the far side of this  reality and purcid
chases  freedom  for  itself on thatside  This service  of sacrifice 
of natural impulses and enjoyments has  in fact  owing  to  this 
altithesis  no  truth  Retention  occurs  along  with  sacrifice  the 
latter is  merely a  symbol which  performs real sacrifice on only 
a small portion and is  therefore in point of fact only a sacrifice 
in  imagination 

  As  regards purposiveness  Enlightenment finds it inept to 
throwaway one  possession in order to  know and  to  prove that 
one  is  liberated  from  all  possessions  to  deny  oneself  one 
enjoyment in order to know and to prove  that one is  liberated 
from all enjoyment Faith itselfapprehends the absolute action 
as a universal action not only is  the action of its  absolute Being 
as its object a  universal action for faith but the individual concid
sciousness  too  has  to  show  that it  is  liberated  entirely  and 
generally from its sensual  nature  But throwing away a  single 
possession  or renouncing a  single enjoyment  is  notthis  unicid
versal  action  and since in  the  action  the  purpose which is  a 
universal purpose and the performance which is  a single percid
formancewould be bound to presen t themselves  to consciouscid
ness  as  essentially incompatible that action shows  itself to he 
one in which consciousness  has  no  part  and  thus  this  kind  of 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

action is  seen  to  be  really  too  naive  to  be  an  action  at  all  It 
is  too naive to fast  in order to prove  that one is  liberated from 
  the pleasures of the table too nalve  to  rid  the  body  of another 
pleasure as  Origen did  in order to show  that  that pleasure  is 
finished and done with The action itself proves to be an external 
and single operation but desire is  rooted inwardly  and is  a  unicid
versal  Its pleasure disappears neither with  the  instrument nor 
by abstention from  particular pleasures 

  But Enlightenment on its side  here  isolates  the  inward 
the unreal  as  opposed to reality just as  it held fast  to  the extercid
nality of the Thing as opposed to  the inwardness offaith in the 
latters contemplation and devotion It places the essential faccid
tor  in  the  intention  in  the  thought  and  thereby saves  itself the 
trouble  of actually  accomplishing  the  liberation from  natural 
aims  On the contrary this  inwardness is  itself the  formal  elecid
ment which  has  its  filling  in  the  natural  impulses  which  are 
justified  simply  by  the  fact  that  they  are  inward  that  they 
belong  to  universal  being  to  Nature 

  Enlightenment  then  holds  an  irresistible  authority 
over  faith  because  in  the  believers  own  consciousnessare 
found the very  momen tsw hich Enligh ten men thas established 
as  valid  Examining the effect of this  authority  more  closely 
its behaviour towards faith seems to rend asunder the  beautiful 
unity of trust and immediate certainty to pollute its spiritual concid
sciousness with mean thoughts of sensuous reality to destroy the 
soul which is composed and secure in its submission  by  the vanity 
of the  Understanding and of selfwill  and  selfafulfilment  But 
as  a  matter of fact  the  result  of the  Enlightenment  is  rather 
todD away with the thoughtless  or rather nonnotional separation 
which  is  presen tin faith  The  believing  consciousness  weighs 
and  measures  bya  twofold  standard  it  has  two  sorts  of 
eyes  two sorts  of ears speaks  with  two  voices  has duplicated 
all  ideas  without  comparing  the  twofold  meanings  In  other 
words  faith  lives  in  two sorts  of nonnotional  perceptions  the 
one the perceptions of the slumbering  consciousness  which lives 
purely in nonnotional thoughts  the other those  of the  waking 
consciousness  whichives  solely  in  the  world  of sense  and  in 
each  of  them  it  has  its  own  separate  housekeeping  The 
enlightenment  illuminates  that  heavenly  world  with  ideas 
beJongingto the world of sense  and pointsout this finitude which 

CULTURE 

 
faith  cannot deny  because it is  self  consciousness and hence  is 
the unity to which both kinds of ideas belong and in which they 
do not fall apart for  they belong to the same indivisible unitary 
self into  which faith  has  passed 

  As  a  result  faith  has  lost  the  content  which  filled  its 
element and collapses into  a state in  which  it  moves  listlessly 
to and fro  within itself  It has  been expelled from its kingdom 
or  this  kingdom  has  been  ransacked  since  the  waking  concid
sciousness has monopolized every distinction and expansion of 
it  and  has  vindicated  earths  ownership  of every  portion  of 
it and given them back to earth Yet faith is not on that account 
satisfied for  this  illumination has everywhere brought to  light 
only single separate  entities  so  that  what  speaks  to  Spirit  is 
only  a  reality without any substance  and a  finitude  forsaken 
by  Spirit  Since  faith  is  without  any  content  and  it  cannot 
remain in this void or since in going beyond the finite  which 
is  the sole  content it finds  only  the void  it is  a  sheer  yearning 
its  truth an empty beyond for  which a  fitting  content can no 
longer  be  found  for  everything is  bestowed  elsewhere  Faith 
has  in fact  become the same as  Enlightenment viz  the concid
sciousness of the relation ofwhat is in itseffinite to an Absolute 
without  predicates  an  Absoute  unknown  and  unknowable 
but there is  this difference the latter is satisfied Enlightenment 
but faith  is  unsatisfied  Enlightenment  However  we  shaH  see 
whether Enlightenment pan remain satisfied  that yearning of 
the troubled Spirit which  mourns  over  the loss  of its  spiritual 
world  lurks  in  the  background  Enlightenment  itself  bears 
within it this blemish of an unsatisfied yearning  as pure  object 
in its empty absolute Being as action and movement in going heyond 
its  individual self to  an  empty  and  unfulfilled  beyond  as  an 
object with  aeontent  in  the  lack  of seljhood  in  the  thing  that is 
useful  Enlightenment will  rid  itself of this  blemish  a  closer 
examination of the  positive  result which  is  its  truth will show 
that in that result the blemish is  in principle already removed 

b  The truth  oj Enlightenment 

  The listless  movement of Spirit which no longer creates 
a  distinction  within  itself has  thus  entered  into  its  own  self 
beyond  consciousness  which  on  the  other  hand  sees  itself 
clearly  The first  moment  of this  clarity  is  determined  in  its 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
necessity and condition by the fact that pure insight or insight 
that is implicitly Notion actualizes itself it does so when it posits 
otherness  or  determinateness  within  itself  In  this  way  it  is 
negative  pure  insight  ie  a  negation  of  the  Notion  this 
negation is  equally  pure and  thus  there  has  come  into  being 
the  pure  Thing 
the  absolute  Being  that  has  no  further 
determination  whatever  Characterized  more  precisely  pure 
insight  qua  absolute  Notion  is  a  distinguishing of differences 
which are no longer differences of abstractions or pure Notions 
which  are  no  longer  selfsupporting  but  are  supported  and 
distinguished only by the movementas a whole This distinguishing 
of what contains  no difference  consists  simply in  the fact  that 
the absolute  Notion  makes itself into its  object  and  posits  itself 
as  the  essence  over  against  that  movement  This  results  in  the 
essence  being  without  that  side  wherein  abstractions  or 
differences are held apart  and therefore becomes pure  thought in 
the  form  of  a  pure  Thing  This then  is  just  the  listless 
uncollsciousmovement to and fro within itselfofSpiritto which 
faith  was  reduced  when  it lost  a  content  that  contained  a 
difference  it  is  at the  same  time  that  movement  of pure  self 
consciousness  for  which  the  essence  is  supposed  to  he  the 
absolutely  alien  beyond  For  because 
consciousness moves about in pure Notions in differences  that 
are  not  differences  it  collapses  in  fact  into  the  unconscious 
movement  to  and fro  of Spirite  into  pure jeeling  or  pure 
thinghood  The selfalienated Notionfor the Notion here isstiH 
standing  at  the  stage  of  this  alienationdoes  not  however 
recognize this  identical essence of the two sidesthe movement 
of  selfconsciousness  and  of  its  absolute  Beingdoes  not 
recognize their identical essence which is in fact their substance 
and  enduring  being  Since  the  Notion  is  unconscious  of this 
unity  absolute  Being  has  value  for  it  only  in  the  form  of a 
beyond standing over against it while the consciousness making 
these  distinctiions  and in this  way having the initself outside 
of it  is  held  to  be  a  finite  consciousness 

this  pure  sefcid

  In  regard  to  that  absolute  Being  Enlightenment  is 
caught  up  in  the  same  internal  conflict  that  it  formerly 
experienced in connection with faith  and it divides  itself into 
two parties One party proves itself to be vic torious by breaking 
up into  two  parties for  in so  doing  it shows  that  it  contains 

CULTURE 

  
within itself the principle it is  attacking and thus has rid itself 
of the onesidedness in which it previously appeared The inter 
est which was divided between itself and  the other party now 
falls  entirely  within  itself  and  the  other  party  is  forgotten 
because  that  interest  finds  within  itself  the  antithesis  which 
occupies its attention At the same  time  however  it has  been 
raised into the higher victorious  element  in  which  it  exhibits 
itself in  a  clarified  form  So  that the schism that arises  in  one 
of the parties and seems to be a misfortune demonstrates rather 
that partys  good fortune 

  The  pure  essence  itself has  no  difference  in  it  con 
sequently  the way in which it does obtain a  difference is  that 
two such pure essences  exhibit themselves for consciousness or 
there is  a  twofold  consciousness  of the  essence  Pure  absolute 
Being is only in pure thought or rather it is pure thought itself 
and therefore utterly beyond the finite  beyond selfconsciousness 
and is only Being in a negative sense But in this  way it is just 
mere  being  the negative of selfconsciousness  As  the negative 
ofself  consciousnessit is  also related to it it is  an external  being 
which  related  to  selfconsciousness  within  which  differences 
and  determinationf  receives  within  it  the  differences  of 
being tasted seen etc  and the relationship is that of sensecercid
taintyand perception 

  Ifwestartfrom this sensuous being into which that nega 
tive beyond necessarily passes  but abstract from  these specific 
ways in which consciousness is  related to it then what remains 
is  pure mttr as  a listless aimless  movempt to  and fro  within 
itself  In this  connection it is  important to  bear in  mind  that 
pure mtier is merely w ha t is left over when weahstract from seeing 
feeling tasting etc ie it is not matter thatis seen tasted felt 
etc what is seen felt  tasted is  not matter  but colour a stone 
a  salt etc  Matter is  rather a pure  ahstraction  and so  what we 
are  presented  with  here  is  the  pure  essence  oj thought  or  pure 
thought itself as  the  Absolute  which  contains  no  differences 
is  indeterminate  and devoid  of predicates 

  One party of the  Enlightenment calls  absolute  Being 
that predicateless Absolute which exists in thought beyond the 
actual  consciousness  which  formed  the  startingpoint  the 
other calls it matter  If these were to he distinguished  as  Nature 
and  Spirit  or  God  then  the  unconscious  and  aimless  inner 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
movement to  and fro  would  lack  the wealth of developed  life 
which would  make it Nature  and the selfdifferentiated  COlla 
sciousness which would make it Spirit or God  The two  as  we 
saw  are absolutely the same Notion the difference lies  not in 
what they actually are  but simply and solely in the different 
startingpoints of the  two developments  and  in  the  fact  that 
each sticks to its own point in the movement of thought If they 
could disregard their own startingpoints they would meet and 
would  recognize  that  what  to  the  one  is  so  it pretends  an 
abomination and to  the  other  a  folly  is  the same thing  For 
to  the  one  absolute Being is  in its  pure thinking  or is  immecid
diately for  pure  consciousness  is  outside finite  consciousness 
the negative  beyond  of it  If it  would  reflect  firstly  that  the 
simple immediacy of thought is nothing else  but pure  being  and 
secondly that what is  negative for  consciousness is  at the same 
time  related  to  it  that  in  the  negative  judgement  the  is 
copula holds together as well as separates the terms it would 
come to see that this beyond characterized as something exist  
iug externally  stands in a  relation to consciousness and is  thus 
the same as  what is  caned pure  matter  the missing moment of 
presence would be gained The other Enlightenmentstarts from 
sensuous being then abstractsfrom the sensuous relationoftastcid
ing seeing etc and makes that being into a pure initself into 
an ahsolute mattef into what is neither felt nor tasted Thisheing 
has in this way become something simple without predicates 
the essence of pure consciousness  it is  the pure N otionas implicitly 
existent or pure  thought  within  itself  This insight does  not con  
sciously take the reverse step from what is what simply is to what 
is  thought which  is  the same as  what simply  is  does  not  take 
the step from the pure positive to the pure negative although 
after all the positive is pure solely through negation while the 
pure  negative  as  pure is  in its  own self seWidentical  and just 
for that reason positive Or again they have not arrived at the 
Notion  found  in  Descartess  metaphysics  that  being  and 
thought are  in  themselves  the same  they have  not arrived  at 
the thought that being pure  being  is  not something concretely 
real  but a  pure  abstraction  and  conversely  pure  thought  selfcid
identity or essence partly is thenegative of self  consciousness and 
therefore being partly as immediately simpJe is likewise nothcid
ing else but being thought is  thinghood  or thinghood is  thought 

CULTURE 

 
  Essence  here  is  split into two in such  a  way  that  to 
begin with  two  different ways  of considering it are  involved 
In part essence must contain  difference  within  itself  in part 
just because of this the two  ways  of considering it  merge  into 
one for  the abstract moments of pure being and the negative 
by which they are distinguished are then united in  the  object 
so considered The universal common to both is  the abstraction 
of a  pure  inward  Qscillation  or  of pure  selfthinking  This 
simple rotatory motion must become more complex because it 
is itself oOly motion by distinguishing its moments  This distincid
guishing of the moments leaves their unmoved  unity  behind 
as  the  empty  husk  of pure  being  which  is  no  longer  actual 
thought no longer has any life within it for  this  process  of difcid
ferentiation is qua difference an the content This process howcid

or insight qua  object  is  expressed in the  Useful  What is  useful 
is  something with an enduring being in itself  or a  Thing  this 
being  initselfis at the same time only a  pure  moment  hence 
it is  absolutely for an  other  but equally is  for  an other  merely 
what it is  in itself these opposed  moments have returned into 
the  indivisible  unity  of beingforself  While  the  Useful  does 
express the Notion of pure insight it is  not pure insight as such 
but insight conceived by it in  the form  of object  it is  merely the 
restless  alternation of those  moments  of which  one  indeed  is 
itself the accomplished  return  into  itself  but only  as  a  beingcid
forself  ie  as  an abstract moment appearing on one side  over 
against the  others  The  Useful itself is  not a  negative  essence 
having in itself these  moments  in  their  antithesis  and  at  the 
same  time as  undivided in one  and the  samerespecl  or as  thought 
as they are qua pure insight the moment of beingforselfis cercid

itisthe awareness of this metaphysics butnotasyetthe comprecid
hension ofit  consciousness has not yetreachedtheunity of Being 
and Notion itself Since the Useful still has the form of an object 
for  pure insight it does  have  a  world  one which it is  trueis 
no longer in andfor itself but yet a world which it distinguishes 
from  itself  Only  since  the  antitheses  have  emerged  at  the 
summit of the  Notion  the next stage win see  them come in to 
collision and the Enlightenment will taste the fruits ofits deeds 
 I  Looking at the objectobtained in relation to this whole 
sphere we see  that  the  actual  world  of culture  was  summed 
up in the vanity of selfcons do us ness  into a  beingforselfwhose 
content is still  that confused world of culture and which is till 
the  single  individual  Notion  not  yet  the  explicitly  universal 
Notion Butreturnedinto itself that Notion is pure insightpure 
consciousness as  pure sel or nega tivity just as faith is  pre cis el y 
the same as pure thQught  or positivity  In that self faith  has  the 
moment that makes it complete  but perishing through being 
thus  completed it is  in pure insight that we  now see  the  two 
moments as absolute Being which is simply thought or the negacid
tive and as  matter  which has positive being  This completeness 
still lacks  that actual world of selfconsciousness  which belongs 

CULTURE 

 
to the vain consciousnessthe world out of which thought raised 
itself to itself  What is  thus lacking is  obtained in Utility in so 
far as  pure insight there acq uires  positive objectivity pure in 
sight is  thereby an actual consciousness  satisfied  within  itself 
This  objectivity  now  constitutes  its  world  it  has  become  the 
truth of the entire preceding world  of the  ideal  as  well  as  of 
the real world The first world of Spirit is the widespread realm 
of its selfdispersed existence and of the selfcertainty of its indivicid
dual formsjust as Nature disperses its life into infinitely various 
forms without the genus  of those forms  having an actual existcid
ence  The second world contains the genus  and is  the realm of 
intrinsic  being  or  truth  over  against  that  certainty  The  third 
world however that of the Useful is  the truth which is equally 
the  certainty  of itself  The  realm of the  truth  of faith  lacks  the 
principle  of actuality  or the  certainty of self as  this  particular 
individual But the actuality or the certainty of self as  this parcid
ticular individual lacks intrinsic being  In the object of pure incid
sight both worldsre united  The Useful is  the object in so far 
as selfcQnsciousnss penetrates it and has in it the certainty of its 
individual self its enjoyment its beingforself  selfconsciousness 
sees  right  into  the  object  and  this  insight  contains  the  true 
essence of the object whichis to be something that is penetrated 
by consciousness  or to  be jor an  ollter  This insight is  thus 
itself a  true knowing  and selfconsciousness  has  equally directly 
the universal certainty ofitself its pure consciousness  in this relacid
tionship in which thereforettuth as  well as  presence and actucid
ality are united  The two worlds are reconciled and heaven is 
transplanted  to  earth below 

III  AaSOL UTE  FREEDOM  AND  TERROR 

  Consciousness  has  found  its  Notion  in  Utility  But  it 
is  partly still an object  and partly for  that very reason still an 
End to be attained  which consciousness  does  not find  itself to 
possess  immediately  Utility  is  still  a  predicate  of the  object 
not itself a  subject  or  the  immediate  ancl  sole  actuality  of the 
object  It is  the same thing that appeared before when beingcid
forselfhad not yet shown itsefto be the substance of the other 
moments a  demonstration which would  have  meant that  the 
Useful  was  directly  nothing  else  but  the  self  of  consciouscid
ness  and  that this  latter  was  thereby in  possession  of it  This 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
withdrawal from the form ofobjectivity of the Useful has howcid
ever already taken place in principle and from this inner revocid
lution there emerges the actual revolution of the actual world 
the new shape of consciousness  absolute freedom 

  In fact  what we  have here  is  no  more  than an empty 
show  of objectivity separating selfconsciousness  from  posses  
sion  For  partly  all existence  and  validity  of  the  specific 
members of the organization of the actual world and  the world 
of faith have in general returned into this simple determinacid
tion as  into their ground and spiritual  principle  partly  howcid
ever this simple determination no longer possesses  anything of 
its  own  it is  rather pure metaphysic  pure  Notion  or  a  pure 
knowing  by selfconsciousness  That is  to  say  of the  beingincid
andforitself of the  Useful  qua  object  consciousness  recognizes 
that its beinginitselfis essentially a  beingforanother  beingin  
itself  as  devoid  of self  is  in  truth  a  passive  self  or  that  which 
is  a  self for  another self  The object  however  exists  for  con   
sciousness in thisabstractform of pure beinginitself for concid
sciousnessis pure insightwhose distinctions are in the pure form 
of Notions  Butthe beingforselfinto which beingforan  other 
returns ie  the self is  not a self belonging exclusively  to  what 
iscaUed object and distinct from ther for consciousness qua 
pure insight is  not a  single  self which could be confronted by 
theobjectasequallyhaving aselfofits own but is pure Notion 
the gazing of the self into  the self  the  absolute seeing of tsef 
doubled the certainty of itself is  the universal Subject and its 
conscious Notion is the essence of all actuality If  then the Usecid
fu  was  merey  the alternation of the  moments  an  alternation 
which did not return into its  own unity  and hence was  still  an 
object for knowing it now ceases to be this For knowing is itself 
the movement of those abstract moments it is  the universal self 
the self ofitself as  well as  of the object and as  universal is  the 
selfreturning unity of this  movement 

  Spirit thus comes before  us  as  absolute freedom  It is selfcid

consciousness  which grasps  the  fact  that  its  certainty  of itself 
is the essence of all the spiritual masses or spheres of the real 
as wel  as of the supersensible world or conversely that essence 
and actuality are consciousnesss knowledge of itself  It is  concid
scious ofits pure personality and therein of all spiritual reality 
and  all  reality is  solely spiritual  the world is  for  it simply  its 

CULTURE 

 
own will and this is  a  general will  And what is  more  this will 
is  not the empty thought of will which consists in silent assent 
or assent  by a  representative  but a  real  general will  the  will 
of all  individuals  as  such  For will  is  in  itself the  consciousness 
of personality or of each  and  it is  as  this  genuine actual will 
that it  ought  to  be  as  the  selfconscious  essence  of each  and 
every  personality  so  that  each  undivided  from  the  whole 
always does everything and what appears as done by the whole 
is  the  direct and  conscious  deed  of each 

  This undivided Substance of absolute freedom  ascends 
the throne of the world without any power being able to resist 
it  For since  in  truth  consciousness  alone  is  the  element  in 
w hieh the spiritual beings or powers have their substance their 
entire system  which  is  organized  and  maintained  by  division 
into masses or spheres has collapsed now that the individual 
consciousness  conceives  the object as  having no other essence 
than  selfconsciousness  itself  or  as  being  absolutely  Nntion 
What made the Notion into an existent objectwas its diremption 
into separate  subsistent  spheres  but when  the  object  becomes 
a  Notion  there is  no longeranything in it with  a  continlling 
existence negativity has permeated all its  moments  It comes 
into existence in such a way that each individual consciousness 
raises itself out of its allotted sphere no longer finds  its essence 
and its  work in  this  palticular sphere  but grasps  itself as  the 
Notion  of win grasps aU spheres as  the essence of this will  and 
therefore  can ouly realize itself in  a  work  which  is  a  work  of 
the whole  In this absolute freedom therefore alLsocialgroups 
ordasses which are the spiritual spheres into which the whole 
is  articuated are abolished  the  individual  consdousnessthat 
belonged to any such sphere  and willed  and fulfilled  itself in 
ithasput aside its limitation its purposeis the general purpose 
its  language universal law  its  work  the  universal work 

  The object and the moment of dijference have here lost 
the meaning of utility which was the predicateof alLreal being 
consciousness  does  not begin its  movement in  the  object  as  if 
this were something alien from which it first had to  return into 
itself  on  the contrary  the object is  for  it consciousness  itself 
The  antithesis  copsists  therfore  solely  in  the  difference 
between the  individual  and  the  universal  consciousness  hut the 
individual consciousness  itself is  directly  in  its  own  eyes  that 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

which had only the semblance of an antithesis it is  universal concid
sciousness and will The beyond of this its actual existence hovers 
over  the  corpse  of the  vanished  independence  of real  being 
or the  being of faith  merely  as  the  exhalation  of a  stale  gas 
of the  vacuous  Etre  supreme 

  After  the  various  spiritual  spheres  and  the  restricted 
life of the individual have been done away with as well  as  his 
two worlds all that remains therefore is  the immanent movecid
ment of universal selfconsciousness as  a  reciprocity of selfconcid
sciousness  in  the form  of universality  and  of personal  consciouscid
ness  the universal  wiH  goes  into  itself and is  a  single  individual 
will  to which universal  law and work stand opposed  But this 
individual  consciousness  is  no less  directly conscious  of itself as 
lniversal will it is  aware that its object is  a law given  by  that 
will and a work accomplished by it therefore in passing over 
into action and in  creating objectivity it is  doing nothing incid
dividual but carrying out the laws  and functions  of the state 
  This movement is  thus  the interaction of consciousness 
with itself in which it lets nothing break loose  to  become afree 
ohjectstanding over agains tit Itfollows from this that i tcannot 
achieve anything positive  either universal  works  of language 
or of reality either of laws and general institutions of conscious 
freedom  or of deeds  and works of a  freedom  that wills them 
The workwhichconscious freedom might accomplish would concid
sist in that freedom  qua  universal substance making itself into 
an object and into an enduring being  This otherness would be the 
moment of difference in it whereby it divided itself into stable 
spiritual  masses  or spheres  and into  the  members  of various 
powers  These spheres would  be  partly the  thoughtthings  of 
a power that is separated into legislative judicial and executive 
powers but partly they would be the real essences we found  in 
the real world of culture  and looking more closely at the content 
of universal  action  they  would  be  the  particular  spheres  of 
labour which would be further distinguished as  more specific 
estates or  classes  Universal  freedom  which  would  have 
separated itsefin this way into its constituent parts and by the 
very fact of doing so would have made itselfinto an existent Subcid
stance would thereby he free from particular individuality and 
would apportion the plurality of individuals  to its  various  con 
stituent parts  This  however  would  restrict  the  activity  and 

CULTURE 

 
the  being of the  personality to  a  branch of the  whole  to  one 
kind of activity and being when placed in the element of being 
personality  would  have  the  significance  of  a  specific  percid
sonality it would cease to  be in truth universal selfconsciouscid
ness  Neither by  te  mere idea of obedience  to  selfgiven  laws 
which would  assign  to  it only a  part of the  whole  nor  by  its 
being represented in lawmaking and universal action does selfcid
consciousIess  let itself be cheated out  of reality  the  reality  of 
itself making the law and accomplishing not a particular work 
but the universal work itself  For where the self is  merely reprecid
sented and is  present only as  an idea there it is not actual  where 
it is  represented  by proxy  it is  not 

  Just as  the individual  selfconsciousness  does  not find 
itselfin this universal work of absolute freedom qua  existent Subcid
s tance soli ttle does it find itself in the deeds  proper and individual 
actions of the will of this freedom  Before the universal can percid
forma deed it mus t concentrate itself into the One of individucid
ality and put at the  head anindividual selfconsdousness  for 
the universal win is only an actual will in a self which is  a One 
But tberebyall other individuals are excluded from the entirety 
of this deed and have only a limi tecl share in it so that the deed 
would  not  be  a  deed  of the  actual  universal  selfconsciousness 
Universal freedom  therefore  can  produce  leitheri  positive 
work nor a  deed  there  is  left  for  it only  negative action  it is 
merely  thefury of destruction 

  But the supreme reality  and  the  reality  which  stnds 
in the greatest antithesis to universal freedoJp or rather the sale 
object that will still exist for  that freedom  is  the freedom  and 
individuality  of actual  selfconsciousness  itself  For  that  unicid
versality which does  not let itself advance  to  the reality of an 
organic articulation and whose aim is  to  maintain itelf in an 
unbroken  continuity  at  the  same  time  creates  a  distinction  J 
wi thin itself becauseit is movement or onsciousness in general 
And moreover by virtue ofitsown abtraction it divides itself 
into  extremes  equally  abstract  into  a  simple  inflexible  cold 
universality and into  the  discrete  absolute hard rigidity and 
selfwilled atomism of actual selfconsciousness Now that it has 
completed  the  destruction  of the  actual  organization  of the 
world  and exists  now just for  itself  this  is  its  sole  object  an 
object that no longer has any content possession  existence or 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

outer extension but is merely this knowledge of itself as an absocid
lutely  pure  and  free  individual  self  All  that  remains  of the 
object by which it can be laid hold of is solely its abstract existcid
ence as such The relation  then of these  two since each exists 
indivisibly and absolutely for itself and thus cannot dispose of 
a middle term which would link them together is one of wholly 
unmediated pure negation  a  negation  moreover  of the  indivicid
dual as a being existing in the universal The sole work and deed 
of universal  freedom  is  therefore  death  a  death  too which  has 
no inner significance or filling for what is negated is  the empty 
point  of the  absolutely  free  self  It  is  thus  the  coldest  and 
meanest of all  deaths  with no  more significance  than cutting 
off a  head of cabbage or swallowing a  mouthful of water 

  In this ftt commonplace monosyllable is contained the 

wisdom of the government the abstract intelligence of the unicid
versal  will  in  the  fulfilling  of itself  The  government  is  itself 
nothing else but the selfestablished fbeus  or the individuality 
of the universal will The government which wills and executes 
its wiUfrom a single point at the same time wins and executes 
a  specific  order and  action  On the  onehand  it exCludes  all 
other individuals from its act and on the other hand it thereby 
constitutes  itself a  government that isa specific  will  and  so 
standsopposedtothe universal will consequently itisabsolutely 
impossible for it to exhibit itself as  anything else  but a jaction 
What is  called government is  merely the victorious faction  and 
in  the  very fact  orits  being  a  faction  lies  the  direct necessity 
onts overthrow and its being government makes it conversely 
into a faction  and so  guilty  When the  universal  win  maincid
tains  that what the government has  actually  done  is  a  crime 
committed against it the government for its  part has nothing 
specific and outwardly apparent by which the guilt of the will 
J  opposed to it could be demonstrated for what stands opposed 
to it as the actual universal wiU is only an unreal pure will  inten 
tion  Being suspected  therefore takes the pi ace or has thesignificid
cance  and  effect  of being  guilty  and  the external  reaction 
against this  reality that lies  in  the simple inwardness of intencid
tion  consists  in  the  cold  matteroffact annihilation  of this 
existent self  from  which nothing else  can  be  taken  away  but 
its  mere being 

  In this its characteristic work absolute freedom becomes 

CULTURE 

explicitly objective  to  itself  and selfconsciousness learns what 
absolute freedom  in effect is  In  itself  it is just this  qbstract  selfcid
consciousness  which effaces  all  distinction  and  all  continuance 
of distinction within it  It is  as such that it is  objective  to itself 
the terror of death is  the vision  of this  negative nature of itself 
But absolutely free selfconsciousness finds  this  its  reality quite 
different from  what its  own  Notion  of itself was  viz  that  the 
universal will is  merely  the positive  essence  of personality  and 
that this latter knows itselfin it only positively or as  preserved 
therein  Here  however  this  selfconsciousness  which  as  pure 
insight  completely  separates  its  positive  and  its  negative 
naturecompletely  separates  the  predicateless  Absolute  as 
pure  Thought and as  pure Matteris confronted with the absocid
lute transition of the one into the other as  a  present reality  The 
uiversal will qua  absolutely positive  actual selfconsciousness 
because it is  this  selfconscious  reality  heightened  to  the  level 
of pure thought or of abstract matter changes round into its negacid
tive  nature  and  shows  itself to  be  equally  that  which puts  an 
end  to  the  thinking  of oneslj or to  selfconsciousness 

  AboluteJreedom a pure  selfidentity of the  universal 
will thus has within it negation  but this  means  that it contains 
difference  in genral and this  again it develops  as  an actual  difcid
ference  For  pure negativity  has  in  the  selfidentical  universal 
will  the  element of subsistence  or  the  Substance  in  which  its 
moments  are  realized  it has  the  mater which  it  can  utilize 
in  acordance  with its  own  determinateness  and in so  far  as 
this Substance has shown itself to  be  the  negative  element for 
the  individual  consciousness  the  organization  of  spiritual 
masses  or  spheres  to  which  the  plurality  of individual  con 
sdousnesses ar assigned thus takes shape once more  These in  
dividuals who have fel tt he fear of death of their absolute master 
again submit to negation and distinctions arrange  themselves 
in the various spheres and return to an apportioned and limited 
task  but thereby  to  their substantial reality 

  Out of this  tumult Spirit would be  thrown  back  to its 
startingpoint l  to the ethical  and  real  world  of culture which 
would have been merely refreshed and rejuvenated by the fear 
of the lord and  master which has  again  entered  mens  hearts 
Spirit would have to traverse anew and continually repeat this 
cycle of necessity if the result were only the complete in terpene

C  BB  SPIRIT 

tration of selfconsciousness  and Substancean interpenetracid
tion  in  which  selfconsciousness  which  has  experienced  the 
negative power ofits universal essence acting on it would desire 
to  know  and find  itself  not as  this  particular individual  but 
only as a universal and therefore too would be able to endure 
the objective reality of universal Spirit a reality excluding selfcid
consciousness qua particular But in absolute freedom there was 
no reciprocal action between a consciousness  that is  immersed 
in  the complexities of existence or that sets  itself specific  aims 
and thoughts and a  valid external world whether of reality or 
thought instead  the world was absolutely in the form of concid
sciousness as a universal will and equally selfconsciousness was 
drawn together out of the whole expanse of existence or manicid
fested  aims and judgements and concentrated into the simple 
self  The  culture  t  which  it attains  in  interaction  with  that 
essence is therefore the grandest and the last is  that of seeing 
its pure simple reality immediately vanish and pass away into 
empty nothingness In the world of culture itself it does not get 
as far as to behold its negation or alienation in thisform of pure 
abstraction on the  contrary its  negation is  filled  with  a  concid
tent  either  honour or wealth  which it gains  in  place  of the 
self that it has  alienated from  itself  or the language of Spirit 
and insight which  the  disrupted  consciousness  acquires  or it 
is  the heaven offaith or the Utility of the Enlightenment  All 
these determinations have vanished in  the loss  suffered  by the 
selfin absol u te freedom its negation is  the death tha tis withou t 
meaning the sheer terror of the negative that contains nothing 
positive nothing that fills  it with a content At the same time 
however  this  negation  in  its  real  existence  is  not  something 
alien it is  neither the  universal inaccessible  neqssity  in  which 
the ethical world perishes nor the particular accident of private 
possession nor the whim of the owner on which  the disrupfed 
consciousness sees  itself dependent  on  the  contrary  it is  the 
universal will which in this its ultimate abstraction has  nothing 
positive and therefore can give nothing in return for the sacricid
fice  But for  that very  reason  it is  immediately  one  with  selfcid
consciousness  or it is  the  pure positive  because it is  the  pure 
negative and the meaningless death the unfilled negativity of 
the self changes round in its inner Notion into absolute  positcid
ivity  For consciousness  the immediate unity of itself with  the 

CULTURE 

universal  will  its  demand  to  know  itself as  this  specific  point 
in the universal will is changed round into the absolutely oppocid
site  experience  What  vanishes  for  it  in  that  experience  is 
abstract being or the immediacy of that insubstantial point and 
this vanished immediacy is the universal will itself which it now 
knows itself to be in so far as  it is  a  pure knowing or pure will 
Consequently  it knows  that will  to  be  itself  and  knows  itself 
to  be  essential  being  but not  essential  being  as  an  immediate 
existence not will as revolutionary government or anarchy strivcid
ing to establish anarchy nor itself as  the  centre of this  faction 
or the opposite faction  on the contrary the universal  will is  its 
pure knowing and willing and it is  the  universal will  qua  this  pure 
knowing and willing It does not lose itseljin that will for  pure 
knowing and willing is  much more it than is  that atomic point 
ofconsciousness It is  thus the interaction of pure knowing with 
itself  pure knowing  qua  essential  being  is  the  universal will  but 
this essential being is abolutely nothing else but pure knowing 
Selfconsciousness  is  therefore  the  pure  knowing  of essential 
being qua pure knowing  Further as  an individual self  itis only 
the form of the subject or of real action a form which is  known 
by it as Jorm  Similarly  objective  reality  being  is  for  it simply 
aselfiess form for  that reality would be something that is  not 
krtown  This  knowing  however  knows  knowing  to  be  essencid
tial  being 

  Absolute  freedom  has  thus  removed  the  antithesis 

between  the  universal  and  the  individual  will  The  selfcid
alienated Spirit driven to the extreme of its antithesis in which 
pure willing and the agent of that pure willing are still distinct 
reduces  the antithesis  to  a  transparent form  and therein finds 
itself  Just as  the  realm of the  real world  passes  over  into  the 
realm  of faith  and insight so  does  absolute  freedom  leave  its 
selfdestroying reality  and  pass  over inJo another land of selfcid
conscious  Spirit where  in  this  unreal world freedom  has  the 
value oftruth In the thought of this truth Spirit refreshes itself 
in so far as it is and remains thought  and knows this being which 
is enclosed within selfconsciousness to  be essential being in  its 
perfection  and completeness  There has  arisen  the  new shape 
of Spirit  that of the moral  Spirit

C  SPIRIT  THAT  IS  CERTAIN  OF  ITSELF  MpRALITY 

  The ethical world  showed  its  fate  and  its  truth  to  be 
the Spirit that had merely passed away in it  the individual self 
This legal person  however has its Substance and fulfilment out 
side of that world  The movement of the world of culture  and 
faith  does  away  with  this  abstraction  of  the  person  and 
through  the  completed  alienation 
through  the  ultimate 
abstraction Substance becomes for Spirit at first the universal 
will and finally Spirits own possession Here then knowledge 
appears  at last  to  have  become  completely  identical  with  its 
truth for  its  truth  is  this  very  knowledge  and  any  antithesis 
between  the  two  sides  has  vanished  vanished  not only jor  us 
or tn  itself  but for seWconsciousness itself  In other words self 
consciousness has gained the mastery over the antithesis within 
consciousness itself This antithesis rests on the antithesis of the 
certainty of self and  of the  object  Now  however  the  object 
is for consciousness itself the certainty of itself viz knowledgecid
just as  the certainty of itself as  such  no  longer  has  ends  of its 
own is  therefore no longer contained  within a  determinate 
ness  but is  pure  knowledge 

  Th us  for  selfconsciousness  its  knowledge  is  the  Subcid

stance itself  This Substance is for it just as immediateas it isabso 
lutely mediated in an  indivisible  unity  It is  immediate  like  the 
ethical consciousness which knows  its  duty and does  it  and  is 
bound up with it as with its own nature but it is  not character 
as  that ethical consciousness is  which on account of Its  immecid
diacy  is  a  specifically determined  Spirit  belongs only to  one 
of the  ethical  essentialities  and  has  the  characteristic  of not 
knowing It is absolute mediation  like the consciousness which culcid
tivates  itself  and  the  consciousness  which  believes  for  it  is 
essentially the movement of the self to set aside  the abstraction 
of immediate existence and to  become conscious of itself as  a  uni 
versaland  yet  to  do  so  neither  by  the  pure  alienation  and 
disruption  of itself and  of actuality  nor  by  fleeing  from  it 
Rather it is  immediately present  to  itsefin its  substance for  this 
is  its knowledge is  the intuited pure certainty of itself  and just 
this immediacy which is its own reality is all reality for the imme 
diate is being itself and as  pure immediacy purified by absolute 
negativity  it is  being  in  general  or all  being 

MORALITY 

  Absolute  essential  being  is  therefore  not  exhausted 
when determined as the simple essence  of thought  it is  all reality 
and this  reality  is  only as  knowledge  What consciousness  did 
not know would have no significance for consciousness and can 
have no  power over  it  Into  its  conscious  will  all  objectivity 
the whole  world  has withdrawn  It is  absolutely  free  in  that 
it knows  its  freedom  and just this  knowledge  is  its  substance 
and  purpose and its sole  content 

 

a  The  moral  view  oj the  world 

  Selfconsciousness  knows  duty  to  be  the  absolute 
essence  It is bound only by duty  and this substance is  its own 
pure consciousness for which duty cannot receive  the form  of 
something alien However as thus locked up within itself moral 
selfconsciousness is not yet posited and considered as  consciouscid
ness  The object is  immediate knowledge and being thus  percid
meated purely by the selfisnot an object  But becauseselfconcid
sciousness isessentially a  mediation and negativity  its  Notion 
impliesrelatibntoan otherness and thus is  consciousness  This 
otherness becausecluty constitutes  the sale  aim and object of 
consciousness is ontheone hand a reality completely without 
significaQce for consdousnessButbecause this consciousness is 
so  completely locked  up within itself  it behaves  with  perfect 
freedom and indifference towards this otherness and therefore 
the existence of this  otherness on the  other hand is  left comcid
pletely free  by selfconsciousness an existence that similarly is 
related only to itself  The freer selfconsciousness becomes  the 
freer also is  the negative object of its consciousness  The object 
has thus become a complete world within itselfwith an indivicid
duaHtyof its  own  a  selfsubsistent whole  of laws  peculiar to 
itselfas wen as  an independent operatibn  of those  laws  and 
a free realization of themin general a  Nature  whose laws like 
its actions belong to itselfas a being which is indifferent to moral 
self  consciousness just as  the latter is  indifferent to it 

  From this determination is  developed a  moral view  of 
theworldwhichconsistsin the relation between the ahsoluteness 
of morality  and  the  absoluteness  of Nature  This  relation  is 
based  on  the  one  hand  on  the  complete  indifference  and  incid
dependence  of Nature  towards  moral  purposes  and  activity 
and on the other hand on  the consciousness  of duty alone as 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
the essential fact  and of Nature as  completely devoid  of inde 
pendence and essential being The moral view of the world concid
tains the devlopmen t of the momen ts  which are presen t in this 
relation  of such completely conflicting presuppositions 

  To begin  with  then  the  moral  consciousness  as  such 
is presupposed duty is  the esence for  this consciousness which 
is  actual and  active  and in  its  actuality  and  action  fulfils  its 
duty  But  this  moral  consciousness  is  at  the  same  time faced 
with  the  presupposed  freedom  of Nature  in  other  words  it 
learns from experience that Nature is not concerned with giving 
the moral consciousness  a sense  of the  unity of its  reality with 
that  of Nature  and  hence  that  Nature  perhaps  may  let  it 
become happy or perhaps may not The non  moral consciouscid
ness on the other hand finds perhaps by chance its realization 
where the  moral consciousness sees  only an occasion  for  acting 
but does t see  itself obtaining through its action  the happicid
ness of performance and the enjoyment of achievement Therecid
fore  it finds  rather cause  for  complaint about such a  state  of 
incompa tibilitybetween its elfa nd existence and about the incid
justice which restricts it to  having its  object  merely  as  a  pure 
duty  but refuses  to let it see  the object and  itself realized 

  The moral consciousness cannot forego  happiness  and 
leave  this  element  out of its  absolute  purpose  The  purpose 
which is expressed aspure duty  essen dan yim plies this individual 
selfconsciousness  individual  conviction  and  the  knowledge  of it 
constitu te an absolute element in morali ty  This elemen t in the 
ohjectified purposein thefuljilledd u ty is  the indvidualconscious 
ness  that  beholds  itself  as  realized  in  other  words  it  is 
enjoyment which is  thus implied in the Notion of morality not 
indeed immediately in morality regarded as  sentiment or discid
Psition butonly in the Notion of its actualization This howcid
ever  means that enjoyment is  also implied in  morality  as  discid
position  for  this  does  not  remain  disposition  in  contrast  to 
action but proceeds to act Of to realize itself Thus the purpose 
expressed as  the whole with  the consciousness  of its  moments 
is  that the fulfilled duty is just as  much a moral action as arealcid
ized  individuality  and  that Nature  the aspect of individuality 
in  contrast  to  the  abstract  purpose  is  Qne  with  this  purpose 
Necessary  as  is  the  experience  of the  disharmony  of the  two 
sides  because Nature is  free  even so  what is  essential  is  duty 

MORALITY 

alone  and  Nature contrasted with it is  devoid  of a  self That 
purpose in its entirety which the harmony of the two constitutes 
contains  within  it actuality  itself  It is  at  the  same  time  the 
thought of actuality The harmony of mornlity and Natureor 
since Nature comes into account only in so far as  consciousness 
experiences  its  unity  with  itthe harmony  of morality  and 
happiness  is  thought  of as  something  that necessarily  is  ie  it 
is postulated  For to say that something is  demanded  means  that 
something  is  thought  of in  the  form  of being  that is  not  yet 
actuala necessity not of the  Notion  qua  Notion  but of being 
But necessity is  at the same time essentially  relation  based  on 
the Notion The heing that is  demanded  then  is  not the imacid
gined being ofa contingent consciousness hut is  implied in the 
Notion of morality itself whose true content is  the unity of the 
pure and the individual consciousness it is  for  the latter to see 
that this unity bejor it an actuality in the content of the purpose 
this  is  happilless  but in its form  is  existence  in  generaL  The 
existence thus demanded ie the unity of both is  therefore not 
a  wish nor  regarded as  purpose  one whose  attainment were 
s tilluncertainitis rather a demand of Reason oran immediate 
certainty and presupposition  of Reason 

 That first experience and this postulate are not the sale 
postulates buta whole circle of postulates opens  up  Nature 
thatis to  say  is  not merely this  wholly  free  external  made of 
being in which  as  a  pure object  consciousness  had  to  realize 
its purpose  This cansciousness is  in  its own self essentially ane 
jorwhichthisotherfreeactualexistence is Le itis itselfa contincid
gent and natural existence This Nature which is farconsciauscid
ness its awn nature is sensuousness which in the shape afvalicid
tion as instincts and inclinatians passesses a specific essentiality 
afits awn or has its own individual purpases and thus isoppased 
tothepure wiU and its pure purpase However in contrast with 
this  oppasitian  pure  consciousness  has  rather  the  relation  af 
sensuousness  to it  the absalute  unity af the latter with  it  far 
its essence Both afthese pure thought and the sensuous aspect 
af cansciousness  are  in  themselves  a single  consciousness  and it is 
precisely pure thought far which and in which this  pure  unity 
is  But qua consciousness what is  explicit for it is  the antithesis 
of itself and  impulses  and  instincts  In  this  canflict  between 
Reasan and sensuousness the essential thing for Reason is that 

 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

the conflict be resolved  the result being  the emergence of the 
unity of both  a unity which is not the former original ie immecid
diate  unity of both in a  single  individual  but a  unity which 
proceeds from the known  antithesis of both  Only such a  unity 
is  actual  morality for  in it is  contained  the  antithesis  whereby 
the self is  consciousness  or first  is  an  actual self in  fact  and 
at the same time a universal In other words in that unity there 
is  expressed  that  mediation  which  as  we  see  is  essential  to 
morality Since of the two moments of the antithesis sensuouscid
ness is sheer otherness  or the negative while on the other hand 
the  pure thought of duty is  the  essence  no  element  of which 
can be given  up it seems  that the resultant unity can only be 
brought  about  by getting  rid  of sensuousness  But since  sencid
suousneSS is itselfa moment of the process producing the unity 
viz  the moment of actuality  we have to  be content in the first 
instance with expressing the unity by saying that sensuousness 
should  be  in  conformity  with  morality  This  unity  is  likewise  a 
postulated being it is not actually there  for whatir there is  concid
sciousness or the antithesis of sensuousness and pure consciouscid
ness Buiat the same time the unity is nolan initselfor merely 
implicit like the first postulate in whichfree Natureconstitutes 
an de men t  oLthe  unity  and inconseq uenee  the  harmony  of 
Nature with the moral consciousness falls  outside of the latter 
On the contrary Nature  bereis  that which is  an  element of 
eonsciousnessitself and we have here to deal with morality as 
such  with  a  morality that is  the active selfs  very  own  Concid
sciousness has therefore itself to bring about this harmony and 
continually  to  be  making  progress  in  morality  But  the  concid
summation of this  progress  has  to  be  projected  into  a  future 
infinitely remote for if it actually carne about  this  would do 
away with the moral consciousness  For morality is  only rnoral 
consciousness as  negative essence for whose pure duty sensuouscid
ness  has  only a  ngative significance  is  only  not  in  conformity 
with duty But in that harmony morality qua consciousness Le 
its  actuality  vanishes just as in  the  moral cQllsciousnessor in 
thu actuality of morality the harmony vanishes  Theconsummacid
tion  therefore  cannot  be  attained  hut  is  to  be  thought  of 
merely as an absolute task ie one which simply remains a  task 
Yet at the same time its con tent has  to be thought of as somecid
thing  which  simply  must  he  and  must  not  remain  a  task 

MORALITY 

whether we imagine the moral consciousness to be altogether 
done away with in this  goal  or  not  Which  of these  really  is 
the case can no longer clearly be determined in the dim remotecid
ness  of infinity  to  which for  that  very  reason  the  attainment 
of the goal is postponed Strictly speaking we shall have to say 
that a  definite idea on this  point ought notto interest us  and 
ought not to be looked for  because it leads to contradictions 
the  contradiction  of a  task which is  to  remain  a  task  and  yet 
ought to be fulfilled and the contradiction of a  morality which 
is  no longer to be a moral  fonsciousness  Le  not actual  Howcid
ever  the idea that a  perfected morality would involve  a  concid
tradiction would do harm  to  the  sanctity  of the  very  essence 
of morality and absolute duty would appear as something uncid
real 

  The first  postulate  was  the  harmony  of morality  and 
objective Nature the final  purpose of the world  the other  the 
harmony of morality and  the sensuous  will  the final  purpose 
of selfconsciousness  as  such  The first  then  is  harmony in  the 
form of an implicit being the other in the form of btingforself 
But  what  connects  as  middle  term  these  postulated  two 
extrenle final purposes is the movement of actual conduct itself 
They  are  harmonies  whose  moments  in  their  abstract  discid
tinctiveness have not yet developed into objects for consciouscid
ness  This  occurs  in  the  actuality in  which  the  sides  appear 
in consciousness proper  each as theotherof the other The postucid
lates arising ftom this now contain the harmonies both in and 
ftJr  themselves  whereas  previously they were  postulated  only 
as separate one being in  itself or implicit and  the other being 
for itself or explicit 

  The moral consciousness as  the simple knowing  and wilcid

Ung  of pure  duty  is  in  the  doing  of it  brought into  relation 
with the object which stands in contrast to its simplicity  into 
relation with  the  actuality of the  complex  case  and  tlereby 
has a  complex moral relationship with it  Here arise in relation 
to  content  the  many  laws  generally  and  in  relation  to  form 
the contradictory powers of the  knowing consciousness  and of 
the nonconscious 

In  the  first  place  as  regards  the  many  duties  the  moral 
consciousness in general heeds only the pure  duty  in  them  the 
many duties qua manifold are specific and therefore S  such have 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

nothing sacred about them for the moral consciousness  At the 
same time however being necessary since the Notion of doing 
implies a complex actuality and therefore a complex moral relacid
tion to it these  many duties must be regarded as  possessing an 
intrinsic being of their own  Further since they can exist only 
in a  moral consciousness  they exist at the same  time  in  another 
consciousness than that for which only pure duty qua pure duty 
possesses  an  intrinsic  being of its  own and is  sacred 

  Thus  it  is  postulated  that  it  is  another  consciousness 
which  makes  them sacred  or which knows  and wills  them as 
duties  The first  holds  to  pure  duty  indifferent  to  all  specific 
content and duty is only this indifference towards such content 
The other however  contains  the equally essential  relation  to 
doing and to the necessity of the specific content since for  this 
other duties mean specific  duties  the content as such is  equaly 
essential as the form which makes the content a duty This con  
sciousnessisconseq uen tly onein which universal and particular 
are simply  one  and its  Notion  is  therefore  the  same  as  the 
N olion of the harmony of morality and happiness  Eor this anticid
thesisequaUyexpresses  the  separation  of the selfequal  moral 
consciousness from that actuality which asmanioldbeing concid
licis  with the simple essential nature ofduty While however 
the  first  postulate  expresses  the  harmony  of  morality  and 
Natyre as  a  harmony that simply is  because in it Nature is 
this negative aspect ofselfconsciousness is  the JlomentQfheing 
this  implicit  harmony on  the  other  hand  is  noweentiaUy 
posited as consciousness  For what simplY is now has the form 
of the content  of duty  or is  the determinateness  in the  dterminate 
duty  The implicit harmony is  thus  the unity of what are simple 
essentialities  essentialities of thougbt and are  therefore  only in 
a consciousness  This is then  henceforth a  master and  ruler of 
the  world  who  brings  about  the  harmony  of morality  and 
happiness and at the sarpe time sanctifies duties in their multicid
plicity  This las t  means  this  much  that for  the  consciousness 
ofplre duty the determinate or specific duty cannot straightway 
be sacred but because a specific duty on account of the actual 
doing which is a specific action is likewise necessary  its necessity 
faUs  outside of that  consciousness  into  another consciousness 
which thus mediates or hrings together the specific and the pure 
duty and is  the reason why  the former  also  has validity 

MORALITY 

 

  In the  actual  doing  however  consciousness  behaves 
as  this  particular self  as  completely individual  it is  directed 
towards reality as such and has this for its purpose for it wills 
to  achieve something  Duty in  general  thus  falls  outside  of it 
into another being which is  consciousness and the sacred lawcid
giver of pure duty  For the  consciousness  which acts  and just 
because it acts  the validity of the other consciousness  that of 
pure duty is  directly acknowledged this  pure duty is  thus the 
content  of another  consciousness  and  is  sacred  for  the  concid
sciousness that acts only mediately viz  through the agency of 
this  other consciousness 

  Because it is  in this way posited  that the validation  of 

duty as something absolutely sacred falls  outside of actual concid
sciousness this latter accordingly stands altogether on one side 
as the impeifectmoralconsciousness Just as in regard to its knowcid
ledge  it knows  itself then as  a  consciousness whose  knowledge 
and  conviction  are  imperfect  and  contingent  similarly  in 
regard to its willing it knows itself as a consciousness whose purcid
poses  are  affected  with  sensuousness  On  account  of its  uncid
worthiness therefore it cannot look on happiness as necessary 
but as  something contingent  and can expect it only as  a  gift 
of Grace 

g  But though its  actuality  is  imperfect  all  the same  its 
pure  will  and knowledge hold  duty  to  be what is  essential  In 
the  Notion  therefore so  far  as  the  Notion  is  contrasted with 
reality  or in  thought  it is  perfect  ut the  absolute  Being  is 
just this being that is  thought  a  being that is  postulated beyond 
reality It is therefore the thought in which morally imperfect 
knowledge and willing are held to be perfect and the absolute 
Being  since  it  gives  full  weight  to  this  imperfection  bestows 
happiness  according to  worthiness  ie  according  to  the  merit 
ascribed  to  the imperfect moral consciousness 

  In this  the moral view of the world is  completed  For 
in  the Notion of the  moral selfconsciousness  the  two  aspects 
pure duty and actuality are explicitly joined in a single nnity 
and consequently  the one like  the other is  expressly without 
a being of its own but is  only a  moment  or is  superseded  This 
becomes explici t for consciousness in the last phase of the moral 
view of the world That is to say it places pure duty in a  being 
other  than  itself  ic  it posits  pure  duty  partly  as  something 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

existing only in  thought  partly  as  something  that  is  not  valid 
in and for itself rather it is  the nonmoral  consciousness  that 
is  held to  be  perfect  Equally  it gives  itself the character of a 
consciousness  whose  actuality  not  being  in  conformity  with 
duty is superseded and qua superseded or in the idea of abso 
lute Being  no longer contradicts  morality 

  For  the  moral consciousness  itself  however  its  moral 
view  of the world does  not mean  that consciousness  develops 
therein its own Notion and makes this its object  It is  not concid
scious of this antithesis either as regards the form or the content 
it does  not relate and compare the sides  of this  antithesis  with 
one  another  but  in  its  development  rolls  onward  without 
being  the  Notion  which  holds the  moments  together  For  it 
knows only the pure essence  or the  object so  far  as  it is  duty  so 
far as  it is  an abstract object of its  pure consciousness as  a  pure 
knowing or as its own self It thinks  therefore only in abstrac 
dons and does  not comprehend  ie  in  terms  of the Notion 
Consequently  the  object  of its  actual  consciousness  is  not yet 
transparent  to  it  it  is  not the  absolute  Notion  which  alone 
grasps otherness as such or its absolute opposite as  its own self 
It does  indeed  hold  its  own  reality  like  all obJective  reality 
to be unessential  but its freedom is  the freedom of pure thought 
incontras t  to which therefore  Nature likewise  has arisen  as 
an  existence  that  is  equally  free  Because  both  are  eq uaily 
present in it ie  the freedom of mere  being  and  the  inclusion 
of this being within conciousness its object becomes  one  that 
hasheing butat the same time exists only in  thought in the last 
stage  of the  moral  view  of the world  the content is  explicitly 
suchthatits being is givento it by thought  and this conjunction 
of being and  thought is  pronounced  to  be what in fact it Scid
imagining 

 I   When we consider the moral view of the world in such 
a  way  that this  objective  mode  is  nothing else  than  the  very 
N odon of moral selfconsciousness which it makes objective  to 
itself  this  awareness  of the  form  of its  origin  gives  rise  to  its 
exposition in  another shape  The  first  stage  which forms  the 
startingpoint is  the actual  moral selfconsciousness  or  the fact 
that there is such a moral selfconsciousness For the Notion gives 
itthisexplicitcharacter viz that all realityingeneral has essen 
tial being for it only so far as  it is  in conformity with duty and 

MORALITY 

 
this essential being it characterizes as  knowledge ie  as  in  im 
mediate  unity  with  the  actual self  Hence  this  unity  is  itself 
actual it is  a  moral  actual consciousness  This  now  qua  concid
sciousness  pictures its content to itself as  an object viz  as  the 
final  purpose  of the  world  as  harmony  of morality  and  all 
reality  But since it thinks of this  unity as  object  and is  not  the 
Notion which  has  mastery over  the  object  as  such  the  unity 
is  a  negative of selfconsciousness for it or it falls  outside of it 
as something beyond its  actual  existence  and  yet at the same 
time is something that also  has being  but a  being existing only 
in  thought 

   This selfconsciousness which qua selfconsciousness  is 
other  than  the  object  is  thus  left  with the  lack  of  harmony 
between  the  consciousness  of duty and reality  and  that  too 
its  own reality  Accordingly  the  proposition  now runs as  folcid
lows  There is  no moral perfect  actual selfconsciousness  and 
since  the  moral sphere is  at all  only in so  far  as  it  is  perfect 
for duty is  the pure  unadulterate intrinsic being or in  itself and 
morality consists only in conformity  to  this  pure in  itselfthe 
second  proposition simply runs  There is  no  moral  existence 
in  reality 

 I   Since however in the third place it is  a  single self  it 
is  in itself or implicit y the unity of duty and reality  This unity 
therefore becomes an object for  it as  perfect  moralityhut as 
a beyond of its  reality yet a beyond that ought to  be actual 

  In this goal of the synthetic unity of the first  two  procid
positions  the selfconscious  reality  ie  actual  selfconsciouscid
ness as well as duty is posited as only a superseded moment For 
neither of these two is single and separate on the contrary each 
of them whose essential  determination lies  in  their beingfree 
from one another is thus in the unity no longer free from the other 
and each  therefore  is  superseded  Hence  as  regards  content 
they  become  as  such  objects  each  of which  counts as  object 
for the other and as regards form in such a way thatthis intercid
change  is  at  the same  time  only  imagined  ie  occurs  only  in 
thought  Or again  the  actually  nonmoral sphere  because  it is 
eq ually pure thought and is  raised above  its  actual existence 
is  yet  in  imagination  moral  and  is  taken  to  be  completely 
valid In this way the first proposition thatthere is a moral self 
consciousness  is  reinstated  but is  bound  up with  the  second 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

 
that there is none  ie that there is one but only in imagination 
or in other words it is true that there is none yet all the same 
it is  allowed  by another consciousness  to  pass  for  one 

b  Dissemblance  or  duplicity 

   In the moral view of the world we see on the one hand 
consciousness itself consciously  produce its object we see that it 
neither encounters the object as something alien to it nor does 
the  object come  before  it in  an  unconscious  manner  On  the 
contrary it proceeds in every case  in  accordance with a  princid
ciple on the basis of which it posits objective being It thus knows 
this la tter to be its own self for it knows i tselfto be the active agen t 
that produces  it  It seems  therefore  to  attain  here  its  peace 
and satisfaction for this  can only be found  where it no longer 
needs  to  go  beyond  its  object  because  this  no  longer  goes 
beyond it On the other hand however consciousness itself really 
places the object outside itselfas a beyond of itself But this object 
with an intrinsic heing of its  own is  equally posited  as  being 
not free from selfconsciousness  but as  existing in the interest 
of  and by means  of  it 

  The  moral  worldview  is  therefore  in  fact  nothing 
other than the elaboration  of this  fundamental  contradiction 
in its various aspects ltis to employ here a Kantian expression 
where it is most appropriate a  whole nest of thoughtless concid
tradictions The way in which consciousness proceeds in this decid
velopment is to establish one moment and to pass directly from 
it to another settingaside the first  but now  as  soon  as  it has 
set up  this second moment it also sets  it aside  again  and really 
makes the opposite moment the essential one At the same time 
it is  also  aware of its  contradiction  and  shiftiness  for  it passes 
from  one  moment  immediately  in  its  relation  to  this  very 
moment over to the opposite Because  a  moment has no reality 
for it it posits that very same moment as  real  or what comes 
to  the same thing in order to assert one moment as possessing 
heing  in  itself  it  asserts  the  opposite  as  the  one  that  possesses 
being in itself  In so doing it confesses  that as  a  matter offact 
it is  in earnest with  neither of them  We  must  examine  more 
closely  the  moments of this  insincere shuffling 

  Let us to begin with not question the assumption that 
there is  an actual moral consciousness because the assumption 

MORALITY 

 
is made directly and not in connection with something precedcid
ing and let us turn to the harmony of morality and Nature the 
first postulate It is supposed to be an implicit harmony not explicid
citly  for  actual  consciousness  not  present  on  the  contrary 
what is  present is  rather only  the contradiction  of the  two  In 
the present morality is assumed as already in existence and actucid
ality is  so  placed  that it  is  not in  harmony with it  The  actual 
moral consciousness  however  is  one  that  acs it is  precisely 
therein that the actuality of its morality consists But in the very 
doing or acting  the place given to actuality  is  displaced  for 
the action is  nothing other than the actualization  of the inner 
moral purpose nothing other than the production of an actuality 
determined by the purpose  or of the harmony of the moral purpose 
and actuality itself  At  the same  time  the performance  of the 
action is a fact of which consciousness is  aware it is  the presence 
of this  unity  of actuality  and  purpose  and  because  in  the 
accomplished deed consciousness knows itself to be actualized 
as  this particular consciousness  or beholds  existence returned 
into itselfand enjoyment consists in  thisthere  is  also  concid
tained in the actuality of the moral purpose that form of actucid
alitywhich is  called enjoyment and  happiness  Action  therecid
fore in fact directly fulfils Whatwas asserted could nottake place 
what was supposed to be merely a postulate merely a beyond 
Consciousness thus proclaims through its deed that it is  not in 
earnest  in  making  its  postulate  because  the  meaning  of the 
action is  really  this  to  make  into  a  present  reality  what was 
not supposed  to  exist  in  the  present  And since  the  harmony 
is postulated for the sake of the actionthat is to say what is to 
to become actual through action must be so in  itself  otherwise 
actuality would not be possiblethe connection of action and 
postulate is  so  constituted that  for  the sake of the  action  ie 
for the sake oflhe actual harmony of purpose and actuality this 
harmony is  postulated as  not  actual  as  a  beyond 

  Since action does  take place the lack offitness between 
purpose and reality is  not taken seriously  at alL  On the  other 
hand action itself does seem to be taken seriously  In  point of 
fact  however  the  actual  deed is  only  a  deed of the  individual 
consciousness  and  therefore  itself only something  individual 
and the result contingent But the purpose of Reason as the unicid
versal  allembracing purpose  is  nothing  less  than  the  whole 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

world a final purpose going far beyond the con ten t of this indivicid
dual deed and  therefore  to  be  placed  altogether beyond anycid
thing  actually  done  Because  the  universal  hest  ought  to  be 
carried out nothing good is  done  In fact  however  the nullity 
of what is actuallydoneand the reality of the whole purpose alone 
which  are  now  postulatedthese  too  are  in  every  respect 
again displaced The moral action is not something contingent 
and restricted for it has as its essence pure duty  This constitutes 
the sole entire purpose and thus  the deed  no matter in what 
other way its content is limited is qua actualization of that purcid
pose  the  accomplishment of the  entire absolute  purpose  Or  
again if reality is  taken to  be  Nature  which has  its  own laws 
and stands in contrast to pure duty so that duty cannot realize 
its law within Nature then since it is duty as such that essenticid
ally matters what we are in fact concerned with is not the fulfilcid
ment ofpure duty  which is  the  whole  purpose for  the fulfilcid
ment would really have as  its  purpose  not pure duty  but its 
antithesis  reality  But thre  is  again a  shift from  the  position 
that it is not reality with which we are coneerued for according 
to the Notion oEmoral action pure duty is essentially an active 
cousciousnes Thus there certainlyought to be action absolute 
duty olJght to he expressed in the whole of Nature aud  moral 
law  to  become natural law 

  If then we allow that it is this highest good that essenticid

ally Inatters then consciousness is not in earnest with morality 
ata For in this highest good Nature does not have a different 
law from  that of morality  Hence  moral  action  itself is  ruled 
out for action takes place only on the assumption of a  negative 
which is  to be set aside  by the action  But if Nture is  inconcid
formity with the moral law thelatter would in fact be violated 
by the settingaside of what is  in existence  In the  assumption 
that  the  hjghest  go  is  what  essentially  matters  there  is 
admitted a situation in which moral action is superfluous and 
does  not take  place  at all  The  postulate  of the  harmony  of 
morality  and  realitya harmony  posited  by  the  Notion  of 
moral action which implies bringing the two into agreemtintcid
is  expressed from this  point of view  too in the form  Because 
moral action is  the absolute  purpose  the  absolute  purpose is 
that there shQuld  be  no such  thing as  moral action 

 I  When we put together these moments which conscious

MORALITY 

 
ness  has  traversed in its ideas of morality  it is  clear that each 
one  in  turn is  superseded  in  its  opposite  Consciousness  starts 
from the ideathatJor it morality and reality do not harmonize 
but it is  not in earnest about this for in the  deed the  presence 
of this  harmony becomes explicit for  it  But it is  not in  earnest 
even about  this  deed since  the deed  is  something individual 
for it has such  a  high  purpose  the highest  good  But this  again 
is only a dissemblance of the facts for such dissemblance would 
do away with all action and all morality  In  other words concid
sciousness is  not strictly speaking in earnest with moral action 
what it really  holds  to  be  most desirable  to  be  the  Absolute 
is that the highest good be accomplished and that moral action 
be superfluous 

  From this result consciousness  must go  on still  further 
in its contradictory movement and of necessity again dissemble 
this suppression  of moral action  Morality  is  the  initself  the 
merely implicit element if it is  to  be  actual  the  final  purpose 
of the world cannotbe fulfilled ra ther the moral consciousness 
must exist on its  own  account and find  itself confronted  by  a 
Nature opposed  to it  But it must  be  perfected  in  its  own  self 
This leads to the second postulate of the harmony of it self and 
the Nature which is immediately an elementin it ie the sensecid
nature Moral selfconsciousness asserts thatits purpose is pure 
is independent of inclinations and impulses which implies that 
it  has  eliminated  within  itself  sensuous  purposes  But  this 
alleged elimination of the element of sense it dissembles again 
It acts  brings its  purpose into actual  existence  and  the  self  
conscious  sense  nature  which  is  supposed  to  be  eliminated is 
precisely this  middle term or mediating element between pure 
consciousness  and  actual  existenceit  is  the  instrument  or 
organ  of the  former  for  its  realization  and  what  is  called 
impulse inclination Moral self consciousness is  nOt therefore 
in earnest with the eliminationof inclinations and impulses for 
it isjust these that are theseljrealizing selfconsciousness  But also 
they ough t not to be suppressed  bu t only to be in conformity with 
Reason  And  they  are  in  conformity with  Reason  for  moral 
action is nothing else but consciousness realizing itself  thus givcid
ing itself the shape of an impulse ie it is immediately the present 
harmony of impulse  and morality  But  impulse  is  not  in  fact 
merely  this  empty shape which  could  have within it a  spring 

C  RR  SPIRIT 

of action  other than  the one it is  and  be  impelled  by it  For 
sensenature is one which contains within itself its own laws and 
springs  of action  consequently  morality cannot  therefore  be 
in  earnest  about  being itself the  mainspring of impulses  the 
angle of inclination for inclinations  For since these have their 
own fixed  quality  and  peculiar  content  the  consciousness  to 
which they were to conform would be rather in conformity with 
thema conformity with which moral selfconsciousness refuses 
to  comply  The  harmony  of the  two  is  thus  merely  implicit 
merely postulated 

In moral action the actually present harmony ofmorality and 
the sensenature was just now asserted  but now  is  displaced 
the harmony is  beyond consciousness in a  nebulous remoteness 
where  nothing  can  any  more  be  accurately  distinguished 
or  comprehended  for  our attempt just  now  to  comprehend 
this unity failed  In this  merely  implicit harmony  however 
consciousness  surrenders  itself altogether  This  implicit  harcid
mony is itsmoralperfection where the struggle of morality and 
the sense  naturehas  ceasedand the  latter  is  in  conformity 
with morality in a way that is  beyond our comprehension  For 
tha treason thisperfection is again only a dissemblanceafalsificid
cation  of the  situationsince  as  a  matter of fact  it would  be 
rather  morality  itself  that  was  given  up  in  that  perfection 
because it is only consciousness of absolute purpose as pure  purcid
pose  one therefore  opposed  to  all  other  purposes  Morality  is 
both the activity of this pure purpose and also the consciousness 
of rising  above  sensenature  of being  mixed  up  with  sensecid
nature and struggling against it  That consciousness  is  not  in 
earnest about the perfection of morality is indicated by the fact 
that consciousness  itself shifts  it  away  into  infinity  ie  asserts 
that the  perfection is  never perfected 

Wat consciousness really holds  to  he  the  truth of the 
matter is  only  this  intermediate state  of imperfection  a  state 
nevertheless which at least  is  supposed  to  he  a progress  towards 
perfection  But  it  cannot  even  be  that  for  to  advance  in 
morality would really be  to  move  towards  its  disappearance 
That is  to say  the goal would be the nothingness or the abolicid
tion mentioned above of morality and consciousness itself but 
to  approach  ever  nearer  to  nothingness  means  to  diminish 
Besides  advancing as  such like  diminishing would  assume 

MORALITY 

 
quantitative differences in morality but there can be no question 
of these  in  it  In  morality  as  in  consciousness  for  which  the 
moral purpose is pure  duty there cannot be any thought at all 
ofdifferene least of all of the superficial one of quantity  there 
is  only one virtue only one  pure duty  only one morality 

  Since then it is not moral perfection that is  taken sericid

ously but ratherthe intermediate state ie as just argued non 
morality we  thus return  from  another aspect  to  the content 
of the first postulate viz we cannot understand how happiness 
is  to be demanded for  this  moral consciousness  on the ground 
onts worthiness It is aware of its imperfection and cannot therecid
fore in point offact demand happiness as a desert as something 
of which it is worthy Itean only ask for happiness to be granted 
as  a free  act of grace Le  it can only ask for  happiness  as  such 
as  something existing in  and for itself  and can  expect  it  not 
on  the absolute ground mentioned above  but as  coming to it 
by chance and caprice Here then nonmorality declares just 
what it isthat itis concerned not about morality  but solely 
about happiness  as such without reference  to  morality 

  By  this second aspect of the moral view  of the  world 
the other assertion of the first aspect  in which the disharmony 
of morality  and  happiness  is  assumed  is  also  nullified  It is 
claimed  that experience shows  that in  this  presen t  world  the 
moral individual often fares  badly while  the  immoral indivi  
dual often flourishes But the intermediate state of an imperfect 
morality which has shown itself to be the essential one dearly 
shows that this observation this supposed experience is merely 
a dissemblance of the true state of the case  For since  morality 
is  imperfect ie  morality in  fact  is  not  what  can  there  be  in 
the experience  that morality fares  badly  Since  at  the  same 
time  it has turned out that it is  happiness simply as  such that 
is involved it is evident that in making the judgement that the 
immoral individual flourishes it was not intended to imply that 
an injustice  occurred  here  The  designation  of an individual 
as immoral necessarily falls away when morality in general is imcid
perfect  and has therefore only an arbitrary  basis  Therefore 
the sense and content of the judgementof experience is  solely 
this  that happiness simply as such should  not have  been  the 
lot of some individuals  ie  the judgement is  an  expression  of 
envy which covers itself with the cloak of morality The reason 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
however why socalled good luck should fall to the lot of others 
is  good friendship which grants and wishes them and itself  too 
this  lucky  chance 

  Morality then in the moral consciousness is imperfect 
this is now what is  put forward  But it is  the essence of morality 
to  be  only  the  perfectly  pure  imperfect  morality  is  therefore 
impure or is  immorality  Morality itself thus exists in another 
being than the actual conscibusness  This other being is  a  holy 
moral  lawgiver  The imperfect  morality  in  consciousness  which 
is  the reason for making these  postulates  means  in  the first  incid
stance that morality when itis posited in consciousness as actual 
stands in relation to  an  other  to  an  existence  and  therefore 
itself receives within it otherness or difference  giving rise  to  a 
whole  variety of moral  laws  The  moral  self  consciousness  at 
the same time however holds these  many quties  to be  unessencid
tial for it is  concerned only wi th  the one  pure duty and  the 
many have no truthfor it in so far as they are specific duties They 
can therefore  have  their truth only in  another  being  and  are 
made sacredw hich they ar not for the moral consdousnesscid
bya holy lawgiver Butthisagain is  only a  dissemblance of the 
real position  For the moral self  consciousnessis its own Abso  
lute and duty is absolutely onlYiwhatitknows as duty But duty 
itknows only as puredu ty  what is not sacredfor it is notsacred 
in itself and whatis not in itsefsacred cannot be made sacred 
by the holy being  The  moral consciousness  too  is  not really 
in  earnest about letting something be  made  sacred  by  another 
consczousnessthan itselffor that alone it holds tobesacred which 
it has itself made sacred and is sacred in  it  It is  therefore Just 
as  little  in  earnest about  the  holiness  of this  other  being  for 
inthis something was supposed to obtain an essentiality which 
for the moral consciousness ie in  itself  it did  not possess 

  If the holy being was postulated in order thatin itduty 
might have its  vaJidity not as  pure duty  but as  a  multiplicity 
of specific  duties  then  this  again  must be  dissembled  and  the 
other being alone must be holy in  so  far  as  only pure duty has 
validity in it  Pure  duty has  aso  in  point  offact validity only 
in another being not in the moral consciousness  Although in 
the  latter it seems  that  pure  morality  alone  has  validity  the 
position must be put in another way for  it is  at the same  time 
a  natural consciousness  In  it  morality is  affected  and  con 

MORALITY 

 
ditioned by the sensenature and is therefore not free and indem 
pendent  but contingent on free  will  in  it  however  as  pure 
will morality is contingent on knowledge  Morality  therefore 
in  and for  itself is  in another heing 

  This  other  being  then  is  here  the  purely  perfect 
morali ty for in it morali ty does not stand in a relation to Nature 
and sense But the reality of pure duty is  its  realization in Nature 
and sense  The moral consciousness attributes its  imperfection 
to  the  fact  that in  it morality has  a positive  relation  to  Nature 
and sense because it holds that an essential moment in morality 
is  that it should have a  negative  and  only  a  negative  relation 
to  them  The  pure  moral  being  on  the  other hand  because 
it is  above  the struggle  with  Nature and sense  does  not stand 
in a negative relation to  them  Therefore in fact  there remains 
for it only the positive relation to them ie just what a  moment 
ago was qua imperfect held to be immoral Buta pure morality 
that was completely separated from reality and so likewise was 
without any positive  relation  to it would  be  an  unconscious 
unreal abstraction in which the concept of moraJity which in  
volves  thinking of pure duty  wining  and doing it  would  be 
done away with Such a purely moral being is  therefore  again 
a  dissemblance of the facts  and has  to be given  up 

  In this  purely moral being  however  the  moments of 
the contradiction in which this synthetic presentation of them 
flounders about are hroughtdoser together and consciousness 
lets these opposites follow one after the other one always being 
replaced by the  other  without  bringing its  thoughts  together 
so that in  the end  it is  forced  to give  up its  moral view  of the 
world and seek refuge  within itself 

  It  knows  its  morality  to  be  imperfect  because  it  is 
affected  by the sensemnatureand Nature opposed  to  it  which 
in part adulterate morality itself as such and in  part give  rise 
to  a  host of duties  by which in concrete cases  of real  action it 
is embarrassed Foreachcaseis the concrescence of many moral 
relations just as  an object of perception  in  general  is  a  thing 
of many properties  and since  the specific  duty is  a  purpose  it 
has a content and its content is  part of the purpose and morality 
is  not pure This latter therefore has its reality in another being 
This reality however  means nothing else  than  that the  being 
of morality  here  is  both  intrinsic  and explicit  explicit  ie  it  is 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

the morality ofa conscious being and intrinsic ie it has an existcid
ence and a reality  In that first imperfect consciousness  morality 
is  not  realized  There  it  is  the  initself  or  merely  implicit 
being in the sense ofa mere thoughtthing for it is  associated 
with Nature and sense with the reality  of being and consciouscid
ness  which  constitutes  its  content  and  Nature  and  sense  are 
morally nothing In the second consciousness morality exists as 
perfect and not as an unrealized thoughtthing But this perfeccid
tion consists precisely in morality having reality in a consciousness 
as well as  afree reality an existence in general in being somecid
thing not empty but fullfilled full of content ie the perfection 
of morality is placed in the fact that what has just been characcid
terized  as  morally nothing is  present  in  it and  intrinsic  to  it 
On one hand it is  supposed to  have validity simply and solely 
as  the  unreal  thoughtthing  of pure  abstraction  and  then 
again equally to have no validity in that mode its truth is  supcid
posed to consistin its being opposed to realityand to be entirely 
free  and  empty  of it  and  then  again  to  consis t  in  its  being 
reality 

 I  The syncretism of these contradictions which is set forth 
at length in the  moral view of the world  collapses  internally 
since  the distinction on which it rests  the distinction  between 
what must  be  thought and postulated  and  yet is  at  the same 
time not essential becomes a distinction which no longer exists 
even in words Whatfinally is posited as diverse both as a nothcid
ing and also as  a  reality  is  one  and  the very same  thing viz 
existence and reality and what is supposed to be absolute only 
as  the  beyond of real being and consciousness  and  yet equally 
to be absolute only in them and so as a beyond to be nothingcid
this Absolute is pure duty and the knowledge ofduty as essence 
The consciousness which makes  this  distinction  that is  no  discid
tinction which asserts that actual existence has no validity and 
at the same time that itis real  that pure morality is  both truly 
essential  and  also  devoid  of essencesuch  a  consciousness 
expresses in one and the same breath the thoughts which it precid
viously separated and itself proclaims that it is  not in  earnest 
about this determination and separation of the moments of self 
and initself or intrinsic being  but that on  the contrary what 
it asserts  as  having absolute  being  outside  of consciousness  it 
really keeps  enclosed  within  the self of selfconsciousness  and 

MORALITY 

 
that what it asserts  to  have absolute  being in  thought  or to  be 
absolutely intrinsic being it for that very reason takes to be somecid
thing that has  no  truth  Consciousness  comes  to see  that  the 
placingapart of these  moments is  a  displacing of them a  discid
semblance and that it would be hypocrisy if nevertheless it were 
to keep them separate But as  moral pure selfconsciousness  it 
flees  from  this  disparity  between  the  way  it  thinks  of these 
moments and its own essential nature flees  from  this  untruth 
which asserts  that to  be true which it holds  to  be untrue  flees 
from this wi th abhorrence back in to itself It is a pure conscience 
which  rejects  with scorn such a  moral idea of the  world  it is 
in its  own self the simple Spirit that certain of itself  acts  concid
scientiously regardless ofsuch ideas and in this immediacy poscid
sesses  its  truth  While  however  this  world  of dissemblance is 
nothing else  but the  developmen t  of moral  selfconsciousness 
in its moments and hence  is  its  reality  its  essential nature  by 
retreating  into  itself  will  not  become  anything  different  Its 
retreat in to itself means rather thil t  consciousness  has  realized 
that its  truth is  a  pretended truth  It would always have  to  be 
giving out this  pretended  truth as  its  truth for  it would have 
to eJpress and preent itself as  an objective idea  but would be 
aware that all this is  merely a dissemblance  It would therefore 
be  in  fact  hypocrisy  and  the scornful  rejection  of that  discid
semblance would  be  itself hefirst expression  of hypocrisy 

c  Conscience  The  beautiful soul  evil  and  its forgiveness 
    The antinomy of the  moral view  of the  world  viz  that 
there is  amoral consciousnes  and  that there  is  none  or that 
the  validation  of duty  lies  beyond  consciousness  and  concid
versely takes place in  itthese contradications were gathered 
up in the idea in which the nonmoral consciousness hasIJral 
validity  its  contingent  knowing  and  willing  are  assumed  to 
have  full  weight  and  happiness  is  granted  to  it as  an act  of 
grace MoraLselfconsciousnessdid not accept responsibility for 
this  selfcontradictory idea  but shifted it on  to  a  being  other 
than itself  But this placing outside of itself what it must  think 
of as  necessary is  as  much  a  contradiction as  regards form  as 
the  other  was  as  regards  content  Because  however  what 
appear  as  contradictory  propositions  which  the  moral  concid
sciousness  makes  clumsy efforts  first  to  separate  and  then  to 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

reconcile are intrinsically the same since pure duty viz as pure 
knowing  is  nothing else  than  the self of consciousness  and  the 
self of consciousness is heing and actuality  and similarly because 
what is  supposed  to  lie  beyond actual  consciousness  is  nothing 
else  than  pure  thought and  thus  is  in fact  the selfbecause 
this is so self  consciousnessJor us  or in  itself  retreats into itself 
and is  aware  that that being is  its  own self  in  which  what  is 
actual is  at the same  time  pure knowing and  pure duty  It is 
itself in its  contingency completely valid in  its  own sight  and 
knows  its  immediate  individuality  to  be  pure  knowing  and 
doing  to  be  the  true reality and harmony 

  This self of conscience  Spirit that is  directly aware of 
itself as  absolute  truth  and  being  is  the  third  self  We  have 
reached it as  the outcome of the  third world of Spirit and we 
shall  briefly  compare it  with  the  two  preceding selves  The 
totality or actuality which  shows  itself to  be  the  truth  of the 
ethical world is  the self of the legal  person its existence concid
sists  in its  being  acknowledged  by  others  Just as  this  person 
is  the  self that  is  devoid  of substance  so  is  its  existence  an 
abstract realitytoo The person counts and thatsimply as a percid
son the self is  the pointimmediateyatrest in the element of 
its being That point is  not separated off from  its  universality 
and therefore the two are not actively related  to  one another  
the universal is in it without any distinction and is  neither the 
content of the  self  nor  is  the  self fiUed  by itself  The  second 
self is  the  world of culture which  has  attained  its  truth  or it 
is Spirit that has recovered itselffrom its dividednessabsolute 
freedom In this self that first immediate unity of individuality 
and universality is  sundered the universal which all the same 
remains a  purely spiritual  entity  the  state  of being  acknowcid
ledged or a universal willing and knowing is object and content 
of the selfand its universal reality But it does not have the form 
of an ex is tence free from the self in this self therefore ito btains 
no filling  and  no  positive  content  no  world  Moral  self  concid
sciousness  does  indeed  let  its  universality  go  free  so  that  it 
becomes a nature ofits own and equallyit holds fast toit within 
itself as  a  superseded  moment  It is  however  merely  an  incid
sincere play ofalternating these two determinations It is as concid
science that it first has in its selfocertainty a content for  the previcid
ously empty duty  as  also  for  the right and  the  universal  will 

MORALITY 

that were empty of content And because this  selfassurance  is 
at  the same  time an  immediacy  conscience exists 

  Moral selfconsciousness  having  attained  its  truth  it 
therefore abandons or rather supersedes the internal division 
which gave rise  to the  dissemblance  the  division  between  the 
initself and the self  between pure duty qua  pure purpose and 
reality qua a  Nature and sense  opposed to  pure purpose  It is 
when  thus  returned  into itself  concrete  moral  Spirit  which  in 
the consciousness  of pure  duty  does  not  give  itself an  empty 
criterion  to  be  used  against actual  consciousness  on  the  concid
trary  pure  duty  as  also  the  Nature opposed  to it  are  supercid
seded moments Spirit is in an immediate unity a selfactualizcid
ing  being  and  the  action  is  immediately  something concretely 
moral 

  Suppose a case of moral action it is an objective reality 
for the knowing consciousness  This  qua  conscience  knows  it 
in an immedite concrete manner and at the same  time it is 
only as  conscience knows  it  Knowing is  contingent in  so  far 
as it issomethingotber than the object  but Spirit that is  selfcid
certain is no nger suqh a contingent knower and a  producer 
Qf thougbts  divofcedfrom reality  On  the  contrary  since  the 
separation of the initselfand tbeselfhas been done away with 
a  case  of moralaction  is  in  the  sensecertainty  of knowing 
directly as  it is  in  itself  and  it is  in  itself only  in  the  way  that 
it is  in this  kind ofJknowing Action qua actualization is  thus 
the pure form  of wilcthe  simple conversion of a  reality  that 
merely is into a  reality that results  from  action  the conversion 
of the bare mode of objective  knowing  Le  knowing an object 
into one of knowing reality as something produced by consciouscid
ness Just as  sensecertainty is  immediately taken up or rather 
converted  into  the  injtself of Spirit  so  this  conversion  too 
is  simple  apd  unmediated  a  transition  effected  by  the  pure 
Notion withou t alteration of the content the ontent  being decid
termined  by  the  interest  of  the  consciousness  knowing  it 
Further conscience does notsplit up the circumstances  of the 
case into a variety ofduties It does  not behave as  a positive unicid
versal medium wherein the many duties would acquire each for 
itself a fixed substantill nature  If it did  then  either  no  action 
could take place atall because each concrete case involves an 
antithesis  in  general  and  in  a  case  of morality  a  clash  of 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
dutiesand  therefore  by  the  very  nature  of action  one  side 
would be injured one duty violated  or  else  if action  did  take 
place there would be an actual violation of one of the conflictcid
ing duties  Conscience is  rather the  negative  One or absolute 
self  which  does  away with  these various  moral substances  it 
is simple action in accordance with duty which fulfills  not this 
or that duty  but knows  and  does  what is  concretely right  It 
is  therefore first  of all  moral action  qua  action into which  the 
previous  moral consciousness that did not act has  passed  The 
concrete shape of the deed may be analysed  by  the consciouscid
ness  looking for  distinctions  into  various  properties  ie  here 
into various  moral relations  and each of these  may either be 
asserted  as  absolutely valid  as  it must be  if it  is  supposed  to 
be  duty  or else  compared  and  tested  In  the  simple  moral 
action of conscience  duties are lumped together in such a  way 
that all  these singl entities are straightway demolished  and the 
sifting of them in the steadfast certainty of conscience to ascercid
tain what our duty is  simply does  not take place 

  Just as Ii tde is there pres en t In conscience tha tfl uctua tcid

  Itrenounces all these attitudes and dissemblances concid
nected with  the  moral  view  of the  world  when  it  renounces 
thatconsciousness which thinks of duty and reality as contradiccid
tory  According to  this  latter view  I  actmoraHy  when  I  am 
conscious ofperforming only pureduty and nothing else but that 
this  means  in fact  when  I  do not  act  But when  I  really  act 
I  am conscious  of an  other  of a  reality  which  is  already  in 
existence  and ora reality  I  wish  to  produce  I  have  a  specific 
purpose and  fulfil  a  specific  duty in  which  there  is  something 
else than the pure duty which alone should be intended  Concid
science on the other hand is  awareness of the fact  that  when 
the moral  consciousness  declares pure  duty  to be  the essence  of 
its  action  this pure  purpose is  a  dissemblance  of the  truth  of 
the matter for the fact is  that pure duty consists in the  empty 
abstraction of pure thought and has its reality and its content 
only in a specific reality in a reality which is  the reality of Con

MORALITY 

sciousness itself and consciousness not as a mere thoughtthing 
but as  an individual  As  for  conscience itself  this  knows  that 
it has its  truth in  the  immediate  certainty  of itself  This  immediate 
concrete selfcertainty is  the essence  of the action looking at 
this  certainty from  the point of view  of the  antithesis  of concid
sciousness  the  content of the  moral  ction is  the  doers  own 
immedia te individuality and the form  of that content is just this 
self as a  pure movemen t viz  as  the individuals  knowing or 
his  own  conviction 

  Looking  more  closely  at  the  unity  of the  moral  concid

sciousness  and at the significance of its  moments  we  see  that 
it regards itself as  the  initself or essence  but as  conscience  it 
apprehends its  beingforself or its self  The contradiction of the 
moral consciousness  resolves  itself  ie  the difference which lies 
at its base proves to be none and it runs away into pure negacid
tivity but this  precisely is  the self  a  simple self which is  both 
a pure knowing and a  knowledge of itself as  this  individual  concid
sciousness  Consequently this  self constitutes  the  content  of 
what was  previously  the  empty  essence  for  it is  actual  a  self 
which  no  longer has  the  significance  of being  a  nature  alien 
to  the essence and with laws of its  owQ  independent of it  As 
the negative it is  the dijJerence  within pure essence a  content 
and one  too  whih  is  valid  in and for  itself 

  Further  this  self  qua  a  pure selfidentical  knowing  is 
the absolute universal  so  that just this knowing as  its own  knowcid
ing as conviction is  duty  Duty is  no longer the  universal  that 
stands over against the self on the contrary it is known to have 
no validity when thus separated  It is  now the law that eists 
for  the  sake of the self  not  the  self that exists  for  the  sake  of 
the law  Law and duty however  have for  that reason the sigcid
nificance not only of beingforself but also  of intrinsic  beinQ  for 
this knowing because it is selfidentical is precisely the initslf 
In consciousness too this initself separates itself from that imcid
mediate unity with beingfor  self as thus standing over against 
the latter it is  being  a  beingforanother  Duty itself  as  dlJty  forcid
saken by the self is now known to be only a moment from signifycid
ing the  absolute  essence  it has fallen  to  the  level  of mere  being 
which  is  not  self  is  not for  itself  and  is  therefore  a  beingforcid
another  But  the  beingforanother remains  an  essential  moment 
just because the self qua consciousness constitutes the antithesis 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

ofbeinguforselfand beingforanother and now duty is present 
in consciousness as something directly actual is no longer merely 
abstract  pure consciousness 

  This beingforanother is  therefore  the  substance which 
remains in  itself or unexplicated which is  distinct from  the self 
Conscience has not given  up pure duty or the  abstract  initself 
duty is  the  essential  moment of relating itself  qUf  universality 
to another  Conscience is  the common element of the two selfcid
consciousnesses and this element is  the substance in  which the 
deed has an enduring reality  the momen t of being recognzzed and 
acknowledged by others The moral consciousness does not possess 
this momen t of recogni tion by others of pure  consciousness which 
has a  real existence  and consequently does  not act or actualize 
anything at all Its initselfis for it either abstract unreal essence 
or being as  a  reality  which  is  not spiritual  The existent  reality 
of conscience however is one which is a seh an existence which 
is  conscious of itself  the spiritual element of being recognized 
and acknowledged  The action is  thus  only  the  translation  of 
its individual content into the objective element in which it is  unicid
versal and recognized and it is just the fact that itis recognized 
that  makes  the  deed  a  reality  The  deed  is  recognized  and 
thereby made real because the existent reality is  directly linked 
with  conviction  or  knowledge  Of  in  other  words  knowing 
ones purpose  is  directly  the element of existence  is  universal 
recognition  For the essence of the action duty consists in  concid
sciences conviction  about it it is just this  conviction  thatis  the 
initself  it is  the implicitly  universal selfconsciousness  or the state 
of being recognized  and  hence  a  reality  What is  done with  the 
conviction  of duty  is  therefore  at  once  something  that  has 
standnganda real existence  There is  then  no  more  talk of 
good intentions coming to nothing or of the good  man faring 
badly on  the contrary  the  duty  that  is  known  to  be  such  is 
fulfilled  and becomes a  reality just because what is  essentially 
a duty is  the universal for  all selfconsdousnesses is  that which 
is  recognized  and  acknowledged  and  thus  positively  is  But 
taken separately and  alone without  the  content  of self  duty 
is  a  heingforanother  something transparent which  has  merely 
the significance of an essentiality in general lacking aU content 
  Ifwe look  back on  the  sphere  where  spiritual  reality 
first made its appearance we find that the Notion involved was 

g 
that the utterance of individuality is  that which is  both in and 
for itself Buttheshape which immediately expressed this Notion 
was  the honest consciousness  which busied itself with  the  abstract 
thing itself Sache  selbst  This thing itself was there a predicate 
but it is  in conscience that it is for  the first  time a subject which 
has  made explicit all  the  moments  of consciousness  within  it 
and  for  which  all  these  moments  substantiality  in  general 
external existence and the essential nature of thought are concid
tained in this certainty of itself  The thing itselP has substanticid
ality  in  general  in  the  ethical  sphere  external  existence  in 
culture  the self  knowing  essentiality  of thought  in  morality 
and  in  conscience  it is  the  subject  that  knows  these  moments 
within it While the honest consciousness always seizes merely 
the empty thing itself conscience on the other hand wins the 
thing in  its  fullness  a  fullness  given  to  it  by  conscience  itself 
Conscience is  this power because it knows  the moments of concid
sciousness  as  moments  dominating  them  as 
essence 

their  negative 

MORALITY 

  When conscience is  considered in relation to the single 
determinations  of  the  antithesis  manifest  in  action  and  its 
awareness of the nature of those determinations its relation to 
the actual  case  in  which  it has  to  act  is  in  the  first  instance 
that of knower  In so  far  as  this  knowing has  in it the  moment 
of universality conscientious action requires that the actual case 
before itshould he viewed unrestrictedly in all its bearings and 
therefore that all the circumstances of the case should be accucid
rately known and taken into consideration But this  knowing 
since it knows  the  universality as  a moment  is  at the same  time 
aware that it does not know all the circumstances Of  in other 
words that it does not act conscientiously The genuinely unicid
versal and pure relation of knowing would be a relation to SOmecid
thing not containing an antithesis a relation to itself but action 
in  virtue  of the  antithesis  it essentially  contains  is  related  to 
a negative of consciousness to areality possessing intrinsic being 
Contrasted with the simplicity of pure consciousness  with  the 
absolute other or implicit manifoldness  this  reality is a  plurality 
of circumstances which breaks up and spreads out endlessly in 
all  directions  backwards  into  their  conditions  sideways  into 
their  connections  forwards  in  their  consequences  The  concid
scientious  mind  is  aware of this  nature of the  thing and of its 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
relation  to  it  and  knows  that  in  the  case  in  which  it  acts  it 
does  not possess  that full  acquaintance with all  the  attendant 
circumstances which is  required and that its  pretence of con 
scientiously weighing all  the  circumstances  is  vain  However 
this acquaintance with and weighing of  all  the circumstances 
are not altogether lacking  but they exist only as  a  moment  as 
something which is only for others and this incomplete knowledge 
is held by the conscientious mind to be sufficient and complete 
because it  is  its  own  knowledge 

  Similarly with the universality of the essence that is with 
the determination of the content by  pure consciousness  Con 
science  when it  proceeds  to  action  enters  into  relation  with 
the many aspects of the case The case breaks up into its various 
separate parts and so  too does  the relation of pure consciouscid
ness  to it with the result  that the  manifold  nature  of the case 
becomes a  multiplicity of duties  Conscience knows  that it has 
to choose  between  them  and  to  make  a  decision  for  none  of 
them in its specific character or in its content is absolute only 
pure  duty  is  that  But  this  abstraction  of  pure  duty  has 
attained in its  reality  the significance of the selfconscious  I 
The selfcertain  Spirit rests  qua  conscience within itself  and 
its real  universality or its duty lies in its  pure conviction  of duty 
This pure conviction is  as such  as  empty as  pure duty  is  pure 
in the sense that there is  nothing in it no specific content  that 
is  a duty But action is  called for  something must be determined 
by  the individual  and  the  selfcertain Spiri t  in which  the Incid
itselfhas attained the significance of the selfconscious I knows 
that it has this determination and content in the immediate cercid
tainty of itself This as a determination and content is the natural 
consciousness  ie  impulses and inclinations  Conscience  does 
not recognize the absoluteness of any content for it is  the abso 
lute negativity of everything determinate  It determines from 
ts  own self  but the sphere of the self in to which falls  the  deter 
minateness as such is the socalled sensnature to have a  concid
tenttaken  from  the  immediate  certainty  of itself means  that 
it has  nothing  to  draw  on  but sensenature  Everything  that 
in previous forms of experience presented itself as  good or bad 
as  law and  right  is  something other  than  the  immediate  cercid
tainty of self  it is  a  universal which is  now a beingforanother 
Or looked at from  another aspect  it is  an object which while 

MORALITY 

  
mediating consciousness with itself  comes  between consciouscid
ness and its own  truth so  that instead of the  object being the 
immediacy  of consciousness  it  rather  cuts  consciousness  off 
from itself  For conscience however selfcertainty is  the  pure 
immediate truth and this truth is  thus its immediate certainty 
of self conceived as content ie this truth is in general the caprice 
of  the  individual  and  the  contingency  of  his  unconscious 
natural being his  sensenature 

  This content at the same time counts as  a  moral essenticid
ality or as duty  For pure duty as  was found when testing laws 
is  utterly indifferent to any content and tolerates any content 
Here it has  at the  same  time  the  essential  form  of beingforcid
self  and this form  of individual conviction is  nothing else  but 
consciousness of the em ptiness of pure duty and of the fact that 
pure duty is only a moment that its substantiality is a predicate 
which has  its  subject in the individual  whose caprice gives it 
its content and can associate every content with this form  and 
attach its  conscientiousness  to  the  content  An  individual  incid
creases  his  property in a  certain way it is  everyones  duty to 
provide for  the support of himself and his  family  and no  less 
to have regard to the possibility of being useful to his fellow  men 
and of doing good  to  thos in  need  The  individual  is  aware 
that thisi a  dirty for  this  content is  directly contained in his 
certainty of himself  furthermore  he  perceives  that  he  fulfils 
this duty in this particular case Others perhaps hold this specid
cific way of behaving to  be humbug they hold to other aspects 
of the concrete case  he  however  holds  firmly  to  this  aspect 
because  he is  conscious  of the  increase of property  as  a  pure 
duty  Thus what others call violence  and wrongdoing  is  the 
fulfilment of the individuals duty to maintain his independence 
in face  of others what they call cowardice is  the  duty of supcid
porting life  and  the  possibility of being  useful  to  others  but 
what they call courage violates both duties But cowardipecancid
not be so ineptas not to know that the preservation of life  and 
the possibility of being useful to others are dutiesso inept as 
not to be convinced of the moral obligatoriness of its action and 
not to know that this obligatoriness consists in knowing it to  be 
such  Otherwise  it  would  be  guilty  of ineptitude  of  being 
immoral Sincemoralityliesin the consciousness of having ful 
filled  ones  duty  this  will  not  be  lacking  when  the  action  is 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

  
called cowardice any more than when it is  called courage The 
abstraction called duty  being capable of any content  is  also 
capable of cowardice The doer  then  knows  what he  does  to 
be a  duty and since he knows this  and  the conviction of duty 
is  the  very essence of moral  obligation  he  is  thus  recognized 
and acknowledged by others  The action  is  thereby validated 
and  has  an actual existence 

  It is  of no use  to  object  to  this  freedom  which  places 
any and every kind of con tent in the universal passive  medium 
of duty and  knowing  by maintaning that another content 
ought  to  hve been  placed  in  it for  whatever  content  it  be 
it contains the blemish Q determinateness from which pure knowing 
is  free  determinateness  which pure knowing can  disdainfully 
reject  or  equally  can  accept  Every  content  because  it  is 
determinate stands on  the same level  as  any other  even if it 
does  seem to be  characterized by  the  elimination  in  it of the 
elementofparticularity  It may seem that since in  the actual 
case duty in general is sundered into an antithesis and thereby 
into the antithesis of individuality and  universality  the  duty 
whose content is  the universal itselfdirectlycontains the nature 
of puredutyand form  and  content are  thus  completely  in 
accord  It might seem  then  that action for the general good 
is  be preferred to action for the good of the individual but 
this universal duty is simply what already exists as  absolute subcid
stance  as  law  and  right  and  is  valid  on  its  own  account incid
dependently of the individuals knowledge and conviction not 
to mention his own immediate interest It is  therefore precisely 
against theformofthatduty that morality in general is directed 
But as  regards its content  thattoo is  a  determinate  content  in so 
far as  the general good is  opposed to the good of the individual 
Conseq uently its law is one from which conscience knows itself 
to be absolutely free  and it gives itself the authority to add  to 
and  take from  to  neglect as  well  as  fulfil  it  Then  again  the 
above distinctivn between duty to  the  individual and duty to 
the universal is in accordance with the nature of the antithesis 
as such not something definitely fixed  The truth is rather that 
what  the  individual  does  for  himself also  contributes  to  the 
general good the more he has made provision for himself not 
only is  there a greater possibility of his being of service to others 
but his actual existence itself consists only in his being and living 

MORALITY 

 
in contact with others His individual enjoyment essentially has 
the meaning of putting what is his own at the disposal of others 
and of helping them  to obtain  their  enjoyment  Therefore  in 
the fulfilment of duty to individuals and so  to oneself  the duty 
to the universal is  also fulfilled  Any weighing and  comparing 
of duties which  might be  made  here  would  be  tantamount  to 
calculating  the  advantage  accruing  to  the  universal  from  an 
action But firstly  the result would be that morality would  be 
made  dependent  on  the  necessary  contingency  of  insight  and 
secondly  it  is  precisely  the  essence  of conscience  to  have  no 
truck with this calculating and weighing of duties and to make 
its  own  decision  without reference  to  any such  reasons 

  In this  way  then  conscience  acts  and  preserves  itself 
in the unity of its essential and actual  being in  the unity of pure 
thought and individuality it is the selfassured Spirit which has 
its truth within itself in its knowledge and therein as knowledge 
of duty  It maintains  itself therein  by  the  very fact  that what 
is positive in the actionthe content as  well as  the form of duty 
and  the knowledge  of itbelongs to  the self  to  the  certainty 
of itself but what seeks to confront the self with an essential being 
of its own  is  held to  be something not true something stripped 
of its self  subsistenceand only a  moment  Consequently what 
counts is not simply knowing in general but consciences knowcid
ledge of the  circumstances  It places  in duty as  the  universal 
initselfness  the content which it takes from its  natural indivicid
duality for the content is one that is  present within itself  This 
content  in virtue  of the universal  medium in  which  it  exists 
becomes  the  duty  which it carries  out  and  empty  pure  duty 
just through this action  becomes established  as  something not 
selfsubsistent  as  only a  moment this content is  the  cancelled 
emptiness of pure duty or its fulfilment But even so conscience 
is  free  from  any content whatever  it absolves  itself from  any 
specific duty wich is  supposed to have the validity of law  In 
the strength  of its  own  selfassurance  it  possesses  the  majesty 
of absolute autarky to bind and to loose  This selfdetermination 
is  therefore  without  more  ado  absolutely in  conformity  with 
duty Duty is the knowing itself this simple seHhood however 
is  the initself for  the  initself is  pure selfidentity  and  this  is 
in  this  consciousness 

  This pure knowing is immediately a beingforanother 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
for as  pure selfidentity it is  immediacy or being But this being 
is  at the same  time  the  pure  universal  the  selfhood  of all  in 
other words  the action is  acknowledged and therefore  actual 
This  being is  the element whereby conscience  stands  directly 
in a relation of eq uality with every selfconsciousness  and  the 
meaning of this relation is  not an impersonal law  but the self 
of conscience 

  However in that this right thing which conscience does 
is  at the same time a  beingforanother  it seems  that a  disparity 
attaches to conscience The duty which it fulfils is  a specific concid
tent it is  true that this content is  the self of consciousness and 
so  consciousnesss  knowledge  of itself  its  identity  with itself  But 
once  fulfilled  set  in  the  medium  of being  this  identity  is  no 
longer  knowing  no  longer  this  process  of differentiation  in 
which its differences are at the same  time immediately supercid
seded  on  the  contrary  in  being  the  difference  is  established 
as  an enduring difference  and  the action is  a  specific  action  not 
identical with the element of everyones selfconsciousness and 
therefore  not necessarily  acknowledged  Both  sides  the  concid
science that acts and the universal consciousness that acknowcid
ledges  this action as  duty are equally free  from  the specificity 
of this  action  On account of this  freedom  their relationship 
in the common medium of their connection is  really a  relation 
of complete  disparity  as  a  result of which  the  consciousness 
which is  explicitly aware of the  action finds  itself in a  state of 
complete uncertainty about the Spirit which does  the action and 
is  certain  of itself  The latter acts  it gives  being  to  a  specific 
content others hold to this being as  this Spirits truth  and are 
therein certain of this S piri t it has declared therein what it holds 
to be duty But it is  free from  any specific duty it is  not present 
at that point where  others imagine it actually  to  be and  this 
very medium of being and duty as something possessing intrinsic 
being count for it only as  a moment What therefore it places 
before them it also  displaces again or rather has straightway 
displaced or dissembled  For its  actual  being is  for  it not this 
duty and determinate character ithas put forward  but the accid
tuality which it has  in  the  absolute certainty of itself 

  Others therefore do not know whether this conscience 
is  morally good or evil  or rather they  not only cannot know 
but they must also  take it to  be evil  For just as  it is  free  from 

MORALITY 

 
the  specificity  of duty  and  from  duty  as  possessing  an  intrinsic 
being so likewise are they What conscience places before them 
they themselves know how to displace or dissemble it is some 
thing expressing only the self of another not their own self  not 
only do they know themselves to be free from it but they must 
dispose  of it in  their own  consciousness  nullify  it by judging 
and explaining it in order to  preserve  their own self 

  But the action of conscience is not only this determination 
of being which is forsaken by the pure self  What is  to be valid 
and to be recognized as duty is so only through the knowledge 
and conviction that it is duty through the knowledge of oneself 
in the deed If the deed ceases to have this self within it it ceases 
to be  that which alone is  its  essence  Its existence  forsaken  by 
this consciousness would be an ordinary reality and the action 
would appear to  us  to  be  the  fulfilling  of ones  pleasure  and 
desire  What ought to  be  there  is  here  an essentiality solely by 
its being known to be the selfexpression of an individuality and 
it is this being known  that is  acknowledged by others and which 
as  such  ough t  to  hive  an existence 

 I  The self enters  into  existence  as  self  the  selfassured 
Spirit exists  as  such for  others  Its immediate  action is  not  that 
which has validity and is  actual what is  acknowledged  is  not 
the  determinate  aspect of the  action  not  its  intrinsic  being  but 
solely the selfknowing self as such The elemntoflasting being 
is the universal selfconsciousness what enters into this element 
cannot be  the effect of the  action  the effect  cannot  endure in 
it and acq uires no permanence it is only selfconsciousness tha t 
is  acknowledged  and  that obtains  an  actual existence 

  Here again  then we  see  language as  the existence  of 

Spirit Language is selfconsciousness existingfor others selfconcid
sciousness which as such  is  immediately present  and as  this  selfcid
consciousness is universal It is the self that separates itself from 
itself which as  pure  I becomes objective  to  itself  which 
in  this  objectivity equally  preserves  itself as  this  self just as  it 
coalesces direc tly with other selves and is their selfconsciousness 
It perceives itself just as  it is  perceived by others and the percid
ceiving is  just existence  which  has  become  a self 

  The content which  language  has  here  acquired  is  no 
longer the perverted and perverting and distracted self of the 
world  of culture  on  the  contrary  it  is  the  Spirit  that  has 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

returned into itself  is  certain of itself  and  certain  in  itelf of 
its  truth  or of its  own  recognition  of that truth  and  which 
is  acknowledged  as  knowing  it  The  language  of the  ethical 
Spirit  is  law  and  simple  command  and  complaint  which  is 
more  the shedding of a  tear about necessity  Moral consciouscid
ness  on the other hand is  still dumb  shut up with itself within 
its inner life for there the self does not as yet have an existence 
existence and  the self stand as  yet only in  an  externai  relation 
to each other Language however only emerges as  the  middle 
term mediating between independent and acknowledged selfcid
consciousnesses and the existentselfis immediately universal accid
knowledgement an acknowledgement on the part of many and 
in  this  manifoldness  a  simple  acknowledgement  The  content 
of the language of conscience is  the self that knows itself as essential 
bezng  This alone is  what it declares and this  declaration is  the 
true actuality of the act and the validating of the action  Concid
sciousness declares its conviction it is in this conviction alone that 
the action is  a duty also it is  valid  as  duty solely  through the 
conviction being declared  For universal self  consdousness is free 
from the specijicaction that merely is what is  valid for that selfcid
consciousness  is  not  the action  as  an existence  but the  conviction 
that it is a duty and this is  made actual in language  To make 
thedeed a reality does noimean here translatingitscontentfrom 
the form  of purpose or beingfor  self in to  the form  of an  abstract 
reality  it  means  translating  it  from  the  form  of immediate 
selfcertainty which knows its knowledge or beingforself to be 
essential being into the form of an assurance  that consciousness 
is convinced of its duty and as conscience knows in its own mind 
what duty is  This assurance thus affirms  that consciousness  is 
convinced  that its  conviction  is  the essence  of the matter 

  Whether the  assurance of acting from  a  conviction  of 

dutyis true whether what is done is actually a dutythese quescid
tions or doubts have no rpeaning when addressed to conscience 
To ask  whether  the  assurance  is  true  would  presuppose  that 
the  inner intention is  different from  the  one put forward  ie 
that what the individual self wills  can be separated from duty 
from the will of the universal and pure consciousness the latter 
would be  put into words  but the former would  be strictly  the 
true motive of the action But this  distinction between the uniM 
versal consciousness and the individualselfisjust what has been 

MORALITY 

 
superseded and the supersession of it is  conscience  The selfs 
immediate knowing that is  certain of itself is  law and duty  Its 
intention through being its own intention is  what is  right all 
that is  required  is  that it should  know  this  and should  state 
its  conviction  that  its  knowing  and  willing  are  right  The 
declaration of this assurance in itself rids the form of its particucid
larity I t thereby acknowledges the necessary universality of the self 
In calling itself conscience  it calls  itself pure knowledge  of itself 
and pure abstract willing ie it calls itself a  universal knowing 
and willingwhich recognizes  and acknowledges  others  is  the 
same as themfor they are just this pure selfknowing and willcid
ingand which for that reason is als recognized and acknowcid
ledged  by them  In the will  of the self that  is  certain  of itself 
in this knowledge that the selfis essential being lies  the essence 
of what is  right  Therefore whoever says  he  acts  in such  and 
such a way from conscience speaks the truth for his conscience 
is  the self that knows and wills But it is essential that he should 
say  so  for  this  self must be  at the same  time  the  universal  self 
It is not universal in the content of the act for  this  on account 
ofitsspecifidty is intrinsically an indifferent affair it is  in the 
form of the act thatthe  universality lies  It is  this  form  which 
is to he established as actual it is  the self which as such is actual 
in language whichdeclares  itself to  be  the truth  and just by 
so doing acknowledges all other selves and is  acknowledged by 
them 

  Conscience  then in the majesty of its elevation above 
specific law and every content of duty  puts whatever content 
it pleases  into its  knowing and willing  It is  the  moral genius 
which knows  the inner voice of what it immediately knows  to 
bea divine voice and since in knowing this it has an equally 
immediate  knowledge  of existenceit  is  the  divine  creative 
power  which  in  its  Notion  possesses  the  spontaneity  of life 
Equally it is  in its own self divine worship for its action is  the 
con templation of its  own divinity 

  This solitary divine worship is at the same time essenti 
ally the divine worship ofa community and the pure inner know 
rzg and perceiving ofitsefadvances to the moment ofconsczouscid
ness  The contemplation of itself is its objective existence and this 
objective element is  the declaration of its  knowing and willing 
as  something  universal  Through  this  declaration  the  self 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
acquires moral validity and the act becomes an effective deed 
The actuality and lasting existence of what it does  is  universal 
selfconsciousness but the declaration of conscience affirms the 
certainty of itself to be pure self  and thereby to  be a  universal 
self  On account of this  utterance in which  the self is  expressed 
and acknowledged as essentia  being  the validity of the act is 
acknowledged  by  others  The  spirit  and  substance  of  their 
association are thus the mutual assurance of their conscientiouscid
ness good intentions the rejoicing over this mutual purity and 
the refreshing of themselves in the glory of knowing and utter  
ing of cherishing and fos tering such an excellen t state of affairs 
In so  far  as  this  conscience  still  distinguishes  its  abstract  concid
sciousness from  its  selfoconsciousness  it  has  only a  hidden  life  in 
God it is  true  that God  is  immediately  present in  its  mind and 
heart in its self  but what is  manifest its actual consciousness 
and  the  mediating  movement  of that  consciousness  is  for  it 
something other than that hidden inner life and the immediacy 
of Gods presence Ids only in the completed form of conscience 
that the  distinction  between its  abstract consciousness  and  its 
selfconsciousness  is  eliminated  Conscience  knows  that  the 
abstract consciousness is just this self  thisbeingfor  itselfthat is 
certainofitself  knows  that it is  precisely in  the  immediacy  of 
the relation of the self to the initselfwhichwhen posited outside 
the self is  an abstract God  and  hidden  from  itthat  the  dif  
ference  is  eliminated  For  that  relation  is  a  mediating  one  in 
which  the  related  terms are  not one  and  the  same  but each 
is an other for the other and only in  a  third term are they one 
The immediate relation however means in Jactnothing else  but 
the unity of the terms  The consciousness  that has  risen  above 
the thoughtlessness that still holds these differenceswhich are 
noneto be differences knows  the immediacy of the presence 
within it of the  absolute Being as  the  unity of that Being and 
its ownself it thus knows itself as the living initself and knows 
that this  knowledge  is  religion  which  as  knowledge  that  has 
a perceived or outer existence is the utterance of the community 
concerning its  own Spirit 

  Here then we see selfconsciousness withdrawn into its 
innermost  being  for  which  all  externality  as  such  has 
vanishedwithdrawn into the contemplation of the I  I in 
which  this is  the  whole  of essentiality  and  existence  It is 

MORALITY 

 
submerged in this  Notion of itself for it has been driven to  the 
limit of its  extremes and  moreover  in  such  a  way  that  the 
moments distinguished whereby it is real or is still consciousness 
are not only for  us  these pure extremes on the  contrary what 
it isfor itself and what is for it intrinsic and what is for it existence 
have evaporated into abstractions which  no  longer  have  any 
stability anys u bs tance for this consciousness itself and all that 
before  was  essential  being for  consciousness  has  reverted  into 
these abstractions Refined into this purity consciousness exists 
in its  poorest form  and  the  poverty which constitutes its  sole 
possession is itselfa vanishing This absolute certainty into which 
substance has  resolved itself is  the  absolute untruth  which  colcid
lapses internally it is  the absolute selfconsciousness in which con  
sciousness  is  submerged 

  Looking  at this  submergence  of consciousness  within 
itself  we see  that the unexplicated substance  is  for  consciousness 
knowledge as  its  knowledge   As  consciousness  it is  divided into 
the  antithesis  of itself and  its  object which  is  for  it  essence 
but it is just this object that is  perfectly transparent is  its  own 
self  and  its  cOlsdousness  is only  this  knowledge  of itself  All 
life  all spiritual  essentiality  has  withdrawn into this self and 
has  lost its  difference from  the   itsel  The  moments  of concid
sciousness  are  therefore  these  extreme  abstractions  none  of 
which endures but each of which loses  itself in  the  other  and 
prod uces it It is the fluctuating a tti tude to itselfof the Unhappy 
Consciousness  but here  this  fluctuation  takes  place explicitly 
for  consciousness  within itself  and  is  conscious  of being  the 
Notion of Reason whereas the Unhappy Consciousness is only 
implicitly that Notion The absolute certainty of itself thus finds 
itself quaconsiousness changed immediately intna sound that 
dies  way into an objectification of its  beingfor  sef  but this 
created world  is  its  speech  which  likewise  it has  immediately 
heard and only  the  echo of which returns  to  it  This  return 
therefore does not mean that the selfis in essence and actuality 
presen t in its speechfor essence is not for it an itself or merely 
implicit  being  but its  very sel  Just as  little has  consciousness 
an outer existence for  the objective  aspect  does  notget as  far  as 
heing a  negative  of the actual self  in  the same  way  thal  this 
self does not attain  to  an  actual existence  It Jacks  the  power 
to externalize itself  the power to make itself into a  Thing and 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

 
to endure mere  being  It lives  in  dread  of besmirching  the 
splendour of its  inner being by action  and an existence  and 
in order to preserve the purity of its  heart it flees  from contact 
with the actual world and persists in its selfwilled  impotence 
to renounce its selfwhich is  reduced to  the extreme of ultimate 
abstraction and to give itselfa substantial existence or to transcid
form its thought into being and put its trust in the absolute difcid
ference between thought and being The hollow object which 
it has  produced for itself now fills  it  therefore  with a  sense  of 
emptiness  Its  activity  is  a  yearning which  merely  loses  itself 
as  consciousness  becomes an object devoid  of substance  and 
rising above this loss and falling back on itself finds  itself only 
as a lost soul  In this  transparent purity of its  moments an uncid
happy socalled  beautiful soul  its  light  dies  away within  it 
and it vanishes like a shapeless vapour that dissolves  into  thin 
alr 

  This silent fusion of the pithless essentialities of the evacid

porated life has however still to be taken in the other meaning 
of the actuality ofconscience and in the manifestation ofitsmove u 
ment conscience has  to be considered as  acting  The objective 
momentinthisconsciousness acquiredabovethedetermination 
ofa universal consciousness  The knowledge  that knows  itself 
is  qua  this  particular self  distinct from other selves  the  lancid
guageinwhich all reciprocally acnowledge each other as  actcid
ingconscientiously this  universal identity faUs  apart into the 
nonidentity of individual be in gfo rsel f  each consciousness  is 
just as  much simply reflected  out oEits  universality into itself 
As  a  result  the antithesis of individuality to other individuals 
and  to  the  universal  inevitably comes  on  the scene  and  we 
have  to consider this  relationship and its  movement  In other 
words this universality and duty have the very oppositesignificid
canee  of the  specific  individuality  that  exempts  itself from  the 
unversal  for  which  pure  duty  is  only  a  universality  that 
appears on  the surface  and is  turned  outwards  duty  is  only 
a  rnatter of words  and  counts  as  a  beingforanother  Oon 
science  which  in  the  first  instance  is  only  negatively  directed 
against duty as this given specific duty knows itself to be free from 
it but since  it fills  the empty duty with a  specific  contentfrom 
itself  it is  positively aware that  it  as  this particular self  makes 
the content  Its  pure self  as  an  empty  knowing  is  something 

MORALITY 

devoid  of content  and  determinatio The  content  which  it 
gives  to  that knowing is  taken from  its  own self  as  this  specific 
self is taken from itself as a natural individuality And in speakcid
ing of the conscientiousness of its action it may well  be aware 
of its  pure self  but in  the purpose  of its  action  a  purpose with 
an actual content it is  aware of itself as  this  particular indivicid
dual  and is  conscious  of the  antithesis  between what it  is  for 
itself and what it is  for  others  of the antithesis of universality 
or duty and its  reflection  out of universality into itself 

  While in this way the antithesis into which conscience 

enters when it acts  expresses  itself in  its  inner being  the  anticid
thesis  is  at the  same  time  a  disparity  on  its  outer side  in  the 
element of existence the disparity of its particular individuality 
in relation  to  another  individual  Its  particularity  consists  in 
the  fact  that  the  two  moments  constituting  its  consciousness 
theselfand theinitself are held to be unequal in value within 
it a dis pari ty in which they are so determined that the certainty 
of itself is  the essential being in face  of the initself or the  unicid
versal which counts only as a  moment In contrast to this intercid
nal  determination  there  thus  stands  the  element  of existence 
or  universal  consciousness  for  which  the  essential  being  is 
rather  universality  duty  while  individuality  on  the  other 
hand which in contrast to the universal is for itself counts only 
as  a  superseded  moment  For  the  consciousness  which  holds 
firmly to duty the first consciousness counts as evil  because of 
the disparity between its innerbeingand the universal and since 
at the same  time  this  first  consciousness  declares its  action  to 
be in conformity with itself  to be duty and conscientiousness 
it is  held by  the  universal consciousness  to  be  hypocrisy 

  The movement of this antithesis is  n the first instance the 
formal production of an identity of what the evil consciousness 
is  in its  OWn  self and what it declares  itself to  be it  must  be 
made  apparent that it is  evil  and  thus  its  existence  made  to 
correspond  to  its  essence  the  hypocrisy  must  be  unmasked 
This return of the  disparity present in  hypocrisy into a  correcid
spondence is  not already an accomplished  fact because  hypocid
crisy as is commonly said demonstrates its respect for duty and 
virtuejusthy making a show of them and using them as a mask 
to  hide  itself from  its  own  consciousness  no  less  than  from 
others  as  if in  this  acknowledgement of the  antithesis  within 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

itself identity and correspondence were implied  Only it is  at 
the same timejust as much reflected out of this spoken acknow 
ledgement and into itself and  the  fact  that it uses  what is  an 
essence as a heingforanother implies rather its own contempt for 
that essence  and  the  exposure  to everyone of its  own  lack  of 
any substantial being For what lets itselfbe used as an external 
instrument shows itself to he a  thing which possesses  no imporcid
tance of its  own 

  Also  this  identity is  not  brought  about  either  by  the 

onesided  persistence of the evil  consciousness  in  its  own  atticid
tude or by the judgement of the universal consciousness  If the 
former denies itselfin face of the consciousness of duty and decid
clares  that what this asserts  to be wickedness  to  be absolutely 
nonidentical  with  the  universal  is  an  action  in  accordance 
with inner law and conscience then in this onesided assurance 
of an identity there still remains its nonidentity with the other 
since this other does not believe it or acknowledge it  In other 
words  since  the  onesided persistence in  one extreme  cancels 
itself out  evil  would  it is  true  thereby  confess  to  being evil 
hut in so  doing it would  directly  abolish itself and cease  to  be 
hypgcrisy and would not as such unmask itself  I tadmits in 
fact  to being eviL by asserting that it acts in opposition  to  the 
acknowledged  uJiversal  according  to  it  own  inner law  and 
conscience  For if this Jaw  and conscience were  not the lw of 
its single individutlity and caprice it would not be something 
inner or peculiar to it but what is  universally acknowledged 
Therefore when anyone says  that he is  acting according to his 
own law ad cOJscience against others he is saying in fact  that 
he is wronging them But actual conscience is not this persistence 
in a  knowing and  willing  that opposes  itself to  the  universal 
on  the  contrary  the  universal  is  the  element  of its  existence 
and its language declares itsaction to be an acknowledged duty 
  Just as little is the persistence of the universal consciouscid
ness in its judgement an unmasking and abolition of hypocrisy 
In denouncing hypocrisy as base vile and so on it is appealing 
in such judgement to its ownlaw just as  the evil  consciousness 
appeals to its law  For the former comes forward in opposition 
to  the  latter and  thereby as  a particular law  I t  has  therefore 
no superiority over the other law rather it legitimizes  it  And 
this zeal  does  the very opposite of what it means  to  do for  it 

MORALITY 

shows that what it calls true or genuine duty and which ought 
to be universally acknowledged is something not acknowledged 
in so doing it concedes to the other an equal right to befor itself 
  Thisjudgement has however at the same time another 
aspect from  which  it  becomes  the  way  to  a  resolution  of the 
antithesis confronting it  The consciousness  of the  universal  in 
its  relation  to  the first evil consciousness does  not behave as 
one that is  actual  and  actsfor the  latter is  rather  the  actual 
consciousnessbut in its antithesis to it  is  a consciousness that 
is  not  entangled  in  the  antithesis  of individuality  and  uni  
versality which occurs when action is entered upon It remains 
in  the  universality of thought  behaves  as  a  consciousness  thClt 
apprehends and its first action is  merely one of judgement Now 
through  this  judgement  it  places  itself  as  we  have  just 
remarked alongside the first consciousness and the latter through 
this likeness comes to see its own self in this other consciousness 
For the  consciousness  of duty maintains an attitude  of passive 
apprehension  but it is  thereby in contradiction with  itself as 
the absolute will of duty as a consciousness whose determining 
comes  solely  from  itself  It does  well  to  preserve  itself in  its 
purity for it does not act  itis the hypocrisy which wants its judgcid
ing to  be  taken for  an actual  deed  and  instead  of proving its 
rectitude  by  actions  does  so  by  uttering fine  sentiments  Its 
nature then is altogether the same as that which is reproached 
with making duty a  mere  matter of words  In both alike  the 
side of reality is  distinct from  the  words  uttered  in  the  onc 
through the selfish purpose of the action in  the other through 
the failure to act at all although the necessity to act is  involved 
in the very talk of duty for duty without deeds is  utterly meancid
ingless 

  Judging however is  also  to he looked  at as  a  positive 
act of thought and has a positive content  Through this aspect 
the contradiction  present in  the  apprehending consciousness 
and its  identity with the first  consciousness  become still  more 
complete The consciousness that acts declares its specific action 
to be a  duty and the consciousness  that judges it cannot deny 
this  for  duty itself is  the  form  which lacks  all  content  but is 
capable  of any  In other words  the  concrete  action  which  in 
its  manysidedness  is  in its  own self diverse  contains  the  unicid
versal aspectthat which is taken as dutyjust as much as  the 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

particular aspect which constitutes the share and interest of the 
individual in the action  Now  the judging consciousness  does 
not stop short at the former aspect of duty at the doers knowcid
ledge  of it  that this  is  his  duty  and at the fact  that  the  doer 
knows it to be his  duty  the condition and status of his  reality 
On the contrary it holds to  the other aspect looks at what the 
action is in itself  and  explains it as  resulting from  an  intention 
different from  the action itself  and from selfish motives  Just as 
every action is capable of being looked at from the point of view 
of conformity to duty so too can it be considered from the point 
of view of the  particularity of the doer for  qua  action it is 
the actuality of the individual This judging of the action thus 
takes  it out of its  outer existence  and  reflects  it  into its  inner 
aspect or into  the form  of its  own  particularity  If the  action 
is  accompanied by fame  then it knows  this  inner aspect to  be 
a desire  for fame  If it is  altogether in  keeping with the station 
of the individual without going beyond this station and ofsuch 
a  nature  that  the  individuality  does  not possess  its  station  as 
a character externally attached  to  it  bu t  through its own self 
gives filling to this  universali ty  there by showing itself capable 
ora higher station then the inner aspect of the action is judged 
to be ambition andso on Since in the action as such thedoer 
attains toa vision of himseljin objectivity or to a feeling of self 
in  his  existence  and  thus  to  enjoyment  the  inner  aspect  is 
judged to be an urge to secure his own happiness even though 
this  were  to  consist  merely  in  an inner  moral  conceit  in  the 
enjoyment of being conscious of his  own superiority andin the 
foretaste  of a hope offuture happiness  No action  can  escape 
such judgement for duty for dutys sake  this  pure  purpose is 
an unreality  it becomes  a  reality in  the  deed  of an individucid
ality and the action is thereby charged with the aspect of particid
cularity No man is  a  hero to his  valet  not  however  because 
the man is  not a hero  but because the valetis a valet whose 
dealings are with the man not as  a hero but as one who eats 
drinks and wears clothes in general with his individual wants 
and  fancies  Thus  for  the judging consciousness  there  is  no 
action in which it could not oppose  to  the  universa  aspect of 
the actlon  the  personal aspect of the  individuality  and  play 
the  part of the moral  valet  towards  the  agent

MORALITY 

   The consciousness that judges in this way is  itselfbase 
because it  divides  up  the  action  producing  and  holding fast 
to the disparity of the action with itself Further it is hypocrisy 
because it passes  off such judging  not  as  another  manner  of 
being wicked  but  as  the  correct  consciousness  of the  action 
setting itself up in  this  unreality  and conceit of knowing  well 
and better above the deeds it discredits and wanting its words 
without deeds to be taken for a superior kind of reality  By putcid
ting itself  then in this way on a level with the  doer on  whom 
it passes judgement it is  recognized  by the latter as  the same 
as himself This latter does not merely find himself apprehended 
by the other as something alien and disparate from it but rather 
finds  that other  according  to  its  own  nature  and  disposition 
identical  with  himself  Perceiving  this  identity  and  giving 
utterance to it he confesses this to the other and equally expects 
that the  other  having  in  fact  put  himself on  the  same  level 
will  also  respond  in words  in which he  win  give  utterance  to 
thisidentitywith him and expects that this mutual recognition 
will  now  exist  in  fact  His  confession  is  not  an  abasement  a 
humiliation  a  throwingaway  of himself  in  relaion  to  the 
other for this  utterance is  not a onesided affair which would 
establish his disparity with the other on the contrary he gives 
himself  utterance  solely  on  account  of  his  having  seen  his 
identity with the other he on his side gives expression to their 
common identity in his confession and gives utterance to it for 
thereason that language is the existence of Spirit as an immediate 
self He therefore expects that the other will contribute his  part 
to  this  exis tenee 

  But the confession of the one who is  wicked  I am so 
is not followed by a  reciprocal similar confession  This was  not 
what  the judging consciousness  meant  quite  the  contrary  It 
repels  this community of nature  and is  the hard heart that is 
jor itself  and which  rejects  any continuity with  the  other  As 
a  result  the situation is  reversed  The one who made  the  concid
fession sees himsefrepulsed and sees the otherto be in the wrong 
when he refuses to let his  own  inner  being come forth  into  the 
outer  existence  of speech  when  the  other contrasts  the  heauty 
of his  own  soul  with  the  penitents  wickedness  yet  confronts 
the  confession  of the  penitent  with  his  own  stiffnecked  uncid
repentant  character  mutely  keeping  himself to  himself  and 

c  BB  SPIRIT 

refusing to throw himself away for someone else  There is  here 
expressed  in its  extreme  form  the  rebellion  of the  Spirit  that 
is certain of itself for it beholds itself  as  this simple selfknowcid
ledge  in  someone  else  and  too  in such  a  way  that even  the 
outer shape of this other is not as in the case of material wealth 
something without substantial being is not a Thing on the concid
trary  what  is  held  opposed  to  this  other is  Thought  simply 
knowledge itself this absolutely fluid continuity of pure knowing 
which refuses  to  put itself into communication with  the  other 
which  in  its  confession  had  ipso  facto  renounced  its  separate 
beingforself and thereby expressly superseded its particularity 
and in  so  doing  posited  itself in  continuity with  the  other as 
a universal The other however retains withn itself and for itself 
its uncommunicative beingforself and itretains in face of the 
individual  who  did  confess  just  the  same  uncommunicative 
beingforself although the latter has ahead y thrown this away 
It thereby reveals itself as  a  consciousness which is  forsaken by 
and which itself denies Spirit for it does not klloW  that Spirit 
in the absolute certainty qf itlf is  lord and master over every 
deed andactuali ty and can cas t  them off and make them as 
if they had never happened Atthe same titne it does not recogcid
nize  the  contradiction it falls  into in not letting  the  rejection 
whichhas taken place in words  be validated as a genuine rejeccid
tion while itself has  the certainty of its Spirit notin an actual 
deed  but in  its  inner  being  and  finds  the  ouler existence  of 
this  inner being in  the  utterance  of its jldgement  It is  thus  its 
own self which hinders  that others  return from  the deed into 
the spiritual existence of speech and into the identity of Spirit 
and by this hardness of heart produces the disparity which still 
exists 

  Now in so far as  the selfcertain Spirit  as  a  beautiful 
soul  does  not  possess  the  power  to  renounce  the  knowledge 
of itself which it keeps  to  itself  it cannot attain  to  an ientity 
with the consciousness it has repulsed nor therefore to a  vision 
of the unity of itself in the other cannot attain to an objective 
existence  Consequently  the identity comes  about only negacid
tively as a heing devoid of Spirit  The beautiful sour lacking 
an actual existence entangled in the contradiction between its 
pure self and the necessity  of that self to externalize i teH and 
change itselfinto an actual existence and dwelling in the imme

MORALITY 

diacy of this firmly  held antithesisan immediacy which alone 
is  the  middle  term  reconciling  the  antithesis  which  has  been 
intensified  to  its  pure abstraction and is  pure  being or empty 
nothingnessthis beautiful soul then being conscious of this 
contradiction in its  unreconciled immediacy  is  disordered  to 
the point of madness wastes itself in yearning and pines  away 
in consumption Thereby it does in fact surrender the beingforcid
self to  which it so  stubbornly clings  but  what  it  brings  forth 
is  only  the  nonspiritual  unity  of mere  being 

  The true ie  the selfconscious and existent  equalization 
of the two sides is necessitated by and already contained in the 
foregoing  The breaking of the  hard heart  and  the  raising of 
it to  universality  is  the same movement which was  expressed 
in the consciousness that made confession of itself  The wounds 
of the Spirit heal  and leave  no scars  behind  The deed  is  not 
imperishable it is taken back by Spirit into itself and the aspect 
of individuality  present  in  it  whether  as  intention  or  as  an 
existent negativity and limitation  straightway  vanishes  The 
self that carries out the action the formofits act is only a  moment 
of the whole and so likewise is  the knowledge that by its judgecid
mentdetermines and establishes the distinction between the incid
dividual and universal aspects of the action The evil consciouscid
ness  referred to  above  posits  this  externalization  of itself  or 
posits itself as a  moment being enticed into openly confessing 
itself by the vision of itself in  the other But just as  the former 
has to surrender its onesided unacknowledged existence of its 
particular beingforself so too must this other set aside its onecid
sided  unacknowledged  judgement  And  just  as  the  former 
exhibits  the power of Spirit  over  its  actual  existence  so  does 
this other exhibit  the  power of Spirit over the specific  Notion 
of itself 

  The  latter  however  renounces  the  divisive  thought 
and the  hardheartedness of the  beingforself which clings  to 
it  because it  has  in fact  seen  itself in  the  first  This  first  concid
sciousness  which  turns  its  back  on  its  actual  existenceand 
makes itself into a superseded particular  consciousness  thereby 
displays itself as in fact a  universal  It returns from its external 
actual existence back into itselfas essential being  and  therein 
the universal consciousness thus recognizes itself  The forgive 
ness  which it extends to  the other is  the  renunciation  of itself 

C  BB  SPIRIT 

of its  unreal  essential  being  which  it  put  on  a  level  with  that 
other which  was  a  real  action  and  acknowledges  that  what 
thought characterized  as  bad  viz  action  is  good  or  rather 
it abandons this dis tinction of the specific thought and its subjeccid
tively determined judgement just as  the other abandons its sub
jective characterization of action  The word of reconciliation  is 
the objectively existent Spirit which beholds the pure knowledge 
of itself qua  universal essence in  its  opposite  in  the  pure knowcid
ledge of itself qua absolutely selfcontained and exclusive indivicid
dualityareciprocal  recognition which is  absolute  Spirit 

 I  It enters into existence only at that point where its pure 
knowledge  about itself is  the  antithesis  and alternation  of its 
dual  aspect  Aware  that  its  pure  knowledge  is  an  abstract 
essence  absolute Spirit is  this  conscious  duty in  absolute  anticid
thesis  to the knowledge  that is  conscious  of itself  qua  absolute 
individuality of self as essence  The former is  the pure continuity 
of the  universal  which is  aware  that  the  individuality  which 
is  conscious of itself as  essence is intrinsically a  nullity  is  evil 
This  however is  the absolute  discreteness  which is  conscious 
of itself in its  pure oneness  as  absolute and  of the  universal  as 
something unreal which exists only for someone else  Bothaspects 
are purified into the unity in which there is  no longer in them 
any  existence  devoid  of self  any  negative  of consciousness 
w here on the contrary  duty is the unchanging identicalcharaccid
teT of its selfknowledge and evil  equally has  its  purpose in its 
 beingwithinitselj and its actuality in its utterance The content 
of this  utterance is  the substance  of its  enduring  existence  it 
is  the  assurance  of Spirits  immanent  selfcertainty  Each  of 
these two sefcertain Spirits has no other purpose than its own 
pure self and no other reality and existence than just this  pure 
self  But yet  they are  different  and  the  difference  is  absolute 
because it is  set in  this element of the  pure  Notion  It is  also 
absolute not only for us  but for  the Notions themselves which 
stand in this antithesis For these Notions though specific in relacid
tion  to one  another  are  at  the same  time  in  themselves  unicid
versal so  that they fill  out the whole range of the self  and this 
self has  no  other  content  than  this  its  own  determinateness 
which neither goes  beyond the self nor is  more  restricted  than 
it for one of them the absol ute  universal  is  equally  the  pure 
knowledge of itself  as  the  other is  the absolute discreteness  of

individuality and both are only this pure selfknowledge  Both 
determinatenesses  are  thus  pure  conscious  Notions  whose 
determinatenness is itselfimmediately a knowing or whose relacid
tionship  and  antithesis is  the    Consequently  they  are  these 
sheer  opposites for  one  another  it  is  the  completely  inner  being 
which thus confronts its own selfand enters into outer existence 
They constitute pure  knowledge  which  through  this  antithesis 
is  posited as  consciousness  But it is  still not yet selfconsciousness 
It becomes  actually such  in  the  movement  of this  antithesis 
For  this  antithesis  is  rather  itself the  indiscrete  continuity  and 
identity ofl    and each through the very contradiction ofits 
pure  universality  which at the same  time  still  strives  against 
its identity with  the  other and cuts  itself off from  it  explicitly 
supersedes itself within its  own self  Through  this  externalizacid
tion  this  knowledge  which  in  its  existence  is  selfdiscordant 
returns ito the unity of the self It is the actual  the universal 
knowledge of itself in its absolute opposite in the knowledge which 
remains  internal  and  which  on  account  of the  purity  Qf its

VII  RELIGION 

  In the structured forms  hitherto considered which  are 
distinguished in  general  as  Consciousness  Selfconsciousness 
Reason  and  Spirit  religion  too  as  consciousness  of absolute 
Being as such has indeed made  its  appearance  although only 
from the standpoint of the consciousness that is conscious of absolute 
Being but absolute Being in and for itself the selfconsciousness 
of Spirit  has  not appeared  in  those  shapes 

  Even Consiousness in so far as it is  the Understanding 
is  consciousness of the supersensible  or the  inner  side  of objective 
existence  But the  sypersensible  the eternal  or whatever else 
it may be caned is  devoid qfself it i orly to  bgin with  tve 
universal wqieh is  a long way yet frqU  bdQg Spirit that knqws 
itself  as Sirit  Then  there  ws  the  dfonsdousns  that 
reached its final shape in the UnbaPPi  Copciousness that Tas 
only  the pain of tlle  Spirit that  wrestld but withovt  llqss 
to  reach  out into  qpjectivity  The  lmity  of the  irdivirjyal  slf
consciousness  and  its  changeless  essenc  to  w hieh  the  forwer 
attains remains  therefore  a  beyond for selfconsciousness  The 
immediate existence of Reason  which  for  us  issued  from  that 
pain and its peculiar shapes have no religion because the selfcid
consciousness  of them  knows  or  seeks  itself in  the  immediate 
present 

  On  the other hand  in  the  ethical world  we  did  see  a 
religion  namely  the  religion  of the  underworld  It is  the  belief 
in  the  terrible  unknown  night of Fate  and  in  the  Eumenides 
of the  departed  spirit  the  former  is  pure  negativity in  the form 
of universality the latter the same negativity in  the form of incid
dividuality  Absolute  Being  is  in  the  latter form  indeed  the 
self and present  since other than present the self cannot be  But 
the individual self is  this  individual shade which has separated 
from  itself the  universality which  Fate is  True  it  is  a  shade 
a superseded particular self  and thus  a  universal self  but the 
negative significance of the shade  has  still  not changed round 

RELIGION 

 

into the positive significance of the universal self  and therefore 
the superseded self still has  at the same time  the  immediate 
significance of this  particular and essenceless  being  But  Fate 
devoid  of self remains  the  unconscious  night  which  does  not 
attain to an immanent differentiation nor to the clarity of selfcid
knowledge 

  This belief in  the  nothingness  of necessity  and  in  the 
underworld becomes  belief in  Heaven  because  the  departed 
self must unite with its  universality  must explicate in this  unicid
versality what it contains and thus become clear to itself  This 
kingdom offaith however we saw unfold its content only in the 
element of thought without the concrete Notion and for that 
reason  perish  in  its  fate  viz  in  the  religion  of the  Enlightcid
enment  In  this  religion  the  supersensible  beyond  of  the 
Understanding is  reinstated  but in such a  way  that selfconcid
sciousness remains satisfied in this world and the supersensible 
empty beyond which is neither to be known nor feared it knows 
neither asaself norasa power 

  In the religion of morality thefact that absolute Being 
is a positive conien t is atlast again recognized but the con ten t 
is  bound up with  the negativity of the Enlightenment  It is  a 
being that is at the same time taken back in to the self in which 
it remains shut up  and  a  differentiated  content  whose  ptrts  are 
just as  immediately negated  as  they are  produced  The  Fate 
however which engulfs this contradictory movement is  the self 
which is  conscious  of itself as  the  Fate of what is  essentialand 
actual 

  The selfknowing Spirit is  in religion  immediately its 
own pureself  consciousness Those forms ofit which have been 
considered  viz  the  true  Spirit  the  self  aliented Spirit  and 
the Spirit that is  certain of itself  together constitute Spirit in 
its consciousness which confronting its world  does  not recognize 
itself therein  But in  conscience  it  brings  itself  as  well  as  its 
objective world in general into subjectionas also  its  picture  
thinking and its spedfic N otionand is now a selfconsciousness 
that communes with its  own self  In  this  Spirit conceived  as 
object has for itself the significance of being the universal Spirit 
that contains  within itself all  essence  and  all  actuality  yet it 
is not in the form offree actuality or the apparent independence 
of Nature  True  it has  shape  or the form  of being  in  that  it 

c  CC  RELIGION 

 
is  the  object  of its  consciousness  but because  in  religion  con a 
sciousness is posited essentially in the determination of selfconcid
sciousness  the shape is  perfectly  transparent to  itself  and  the 
reality  it contains is  shut  up in it and superseded  in  it in just 
the same way as  when  we  speak of all reality  it is  universal 
reality  as  thought 

  Since  then  in  religion  the  determination  of the  concid
sciousness proper of Spirit does  not have the form offree othercid
ness  Spiries existence is  distinct from its selfconsciousness  and its 
reality properfaUs outside of religion There is indeed one Spirit 
of both but its consciousness does  not embrace  both together 
and  religion  appears  as  a  part  of existence  of conduct  and 
activity whose other part is  the life  lived  in its  real  world  As 
we now know that Spirit in its own word and Spirit conscious 
of itself as Spirit orSpirit in religionare the same the perfeccid
tion ofreHgion consists in the two becoming identical with each 
other not only that religion concerns itself with Spirits reality 
but  conversely  that  Spirit  as  seWconscious  Spirit  becomes 
actual to itself and object of its  consciousness  So far as  Spirit  in 
religion pictures itselftoitselfitisindeed consciousness and the 
reality enclosed  within  religion  is  the  shape  and the  guise  of 
its picturethinking But  in  this  picturethinking reaHtydoes 
not receive its  perfect  due  viz to be not  merely  a  guise  but 
anindependent freeexistence andconverseybeca use itlacks 
perfection within itselfit is a specijic shape which does not attain 
to what it ought to  show forth  viz  Spirit that is  conscious of 
itself  If its  shape is  to  express  Spirit itself  it  must  be  nothing 
else than Spirit and Spirit must appear to itself or be in actu 
aity what it is in its essence Only by so doingwould that also 
be obtained whichinay seem to be the demand for the opposite 
viz  that  the  ohject  of its  consciousness  have  at  the  same  time 
the form offreeactuality but only Spirit that is  object to  itself 
as absolute Spirit is  conscious of itself as  a free actuality to  the 
extentthat ilis and remains  conscious  ofitself therein 

  When selfmconsdousness and consciousness proper relicid
gion and Spirit in its world  or Spirits existence  are in  the first 
instance distinguished from each other the latter consists in the 
totality  of Spirit so  far  as  its  moments  exhibit  themselves  in 
separation each on its own accollnt  But the  moments are con D 
sciousness  selfconsciousness  Reason  and SpiritSpirit that is  as 

RELIGION 

immediate Spirit which is not yet consciousness of Spirit Their 
totality taken together constitutes Spirit in its mundane existence 
generally Spirit as such contains the previous structured shapes 
in universal determinations in the  moments just named  Relicid
gion  presupposes  that these  have  run  their  full  course  and  is 
their simple  totality  or absolute  self  The  course  traversed  by 
these  moments is  moreover  in  relation  to  religion  not  to  be 
represented  as  occurring in  Time  Only  the  totality  of Spirit 
is  in Time and the shapes which are  shapes  of the  totality 
of Spirit  display  themselves in a  temporal succession  for  only 
the whole has true actuality and therefore the form of pure freecid
dom in face oran other a form which expresses itself as  Time 
But the  moments of the whole consciousness selfconsciousness 
Reason  and  Spirit just  because  they  are  moments  have  no 
edstencein separation from one anoter Just as Spirit was discid
tinguished from  its  moments so we  have further  in  the  third 
place  to  dis tinguish from  these  momen ts  themselves  their incid
dividual determination  We saw  that each  of those  moments 
was differentiated again in its own selfintn a process of its own 
and assumed different shapes as eg in consciousness sensecid
certainty and perception were distinct from each other  These 
lattershapes fall apart in Time and belong to a particular totality 
For  Spirit  descends  from  its  universality  to  individuality 
through determinationThe determination or middle term is 
consciousness seWconsciousness and so on  But individuality  is 
constituted  by  the shapes assumed by  these  moments  These 
therefore exhibit Spirit in its individuality or actuality  and are 
distinguished from one another in Time though in such a way 
that the later moment retains  within  it the  preceding one 

  If  therefore  religion  is  the  perfection  of Spirit  into 

which  its  individual  momentsconsciousness  selfconsciouscid
ness  Reason  and  Spiritreturn  and  have  returned  as  into 
their ground  they  together constitute  the  existent  actuality  of 
the  totality of Spirit which  s  only as  the  differentiating  and 
selfreturningmovement of these its aspects The genesis dfreHcid
ginn  in  general  is  contained  in  the  movement  of the  universal 
moments But since each of these attributes was exhibited not 
merely as it determines itself in general but as  it is in and for 
itself Le as it runs its course as a totality within itself therefore 
what has  come  to  be  is  not  merely  the  genesis  of religion  in 

C  CC  RELIGION 

general  those complete processes of the individual aspects at the 
same time contain the specificforms of religion itself The totality 
of Spirit  the  Spirit of religion  is  again  the  movement  away 
from its immediacy towards  the attainment of the knowledge  of 
what it is  in  itself or immediately the movement in which fincid
ally the shape  in which it appears for its consciousness will  be 
perfectly identical with its  essence  and it will  behold itself as 
it is  In  this  genesis  of religion  Spirit itself therefore  assumes 
specific  shapes  which  constitute  the different moments  of this 
movement at the same time  the specific religion  has  likewise 
a  specific actual Spirit  Thus  if consciousness  selfconsciouscid
ness  Reason  and  Spirit  belong  to  selfknowing  Spirit  in 
general similarly the specific shapes which were specially decid
veloped within  consciousness  selfconsciousness  Reason  and 
Spirit  belong  to  the  specific  shapes  of  selfknowing  Spirit 
From the shapes belonging to each of its  moments the specific 
shape  of religion  picks  out  the  one  appropriate  to  it for  its 
actual Spirit  The one distinctive feature  which charaeterizes 
the religion penetrates every aspect of its actual existence  and 
stamps  them with  this  common character 

  In this waythe arrangement of the shapes which have 
hitherto appeared differs from the way theyppeared in  their 
own  order  On this  point we shall  observe  briefly  at the  start 
what is  necessary  In  the series  we  considered  eachmqlJlent 
exploring its own depths formed itself into a  totality within its 
own  peculiar principle  and  cognition  was  the  depth  or  the 
Spirit wherein the  mOIPents  which  have  no other subsistence 
of their own possessed their substance But this substance is now 
manifest it is  the depth of Spirit that is  certain of itself which 
does  not  allow  the  principle  of each  individual  moment  to 
hecome isolated  and  to  make itself a  totality within itself  on 
the contrary gathering and holding together all these moments 
within itself  it advances  within  this  total wealth  of its  actual 
Spirit and al  its particular moments take anrlreceive in  com 
mon in to themselves the like determina teness of the whole This 
selfcertain Spirit and its  movement is  their true actuality qnd 
the  beinginandforseif which  belongs  to  each  moment  Thus 
while the previous single series in its advance marked the retrocid
gressive  steps  in  it  by  nodes  but continued  itself again  from 
them in a single line it is now as it were broken at these nodes 

RELIGION 

 
at  these  universal  moments  and  falls  apart  into  many  lines 
which gathered up into a single bundle at the same time comcid
bine symmetrically so that the similar differences in which each 
particular moment  took shape within itself meet  together 

However it is selfevident from the whole exposition how this 
coordination of the general  directions  here  represented  is  to 
be  understood  so  that  it is  superfluous  to  remark  that  these 
differences are to be grasped essentially only as  moments of the 
development not as parts  In actual Spirit they are attributes 
of its  substance  but in  religion  on  the  other  hand  they  are 
only  predicates  of the  Subject  Similarly  all  forms  in  general 
are certainly in  themselves  or for  us  contained  in  Spirit and  in 
each Spirit  but  as  regards  Spirits  actuality  the  main  point 
is solely which determinateness is  explicit for  it in its  consciouscid
ness  in  which  determinateness  it  has  expressed  its  self  or  in 
which  shape  it knows  i tsessence 

  The distinction which was  made  between actual Spirit 

and Spirit that knows itself as Spirit or between itself qua concid
scionsness and qua selfconsciousness is superseded in the Spirit 
that knows itselfin its  truth its consciousness  and its  selfcon 
sdousnessare on the same level But as religion here is to begin 
with immediate  this distinction has not yet returned into Spirit 
What is  posited is only the Notion of religion in this  the essence 
is  self  consciousness which is  conscious of being all  truth and 
contains all  reality within  that  truth  This  self  consciousness 
has  as  consciousness  itself for  object  Spirit  which  to  begin 
with has an immediate knowledge of its elf is  thus to itself Spirit 
in  the form  of immediacy  and  the  determinateness  of the  form 
in which it appears to itself is  that of mere being  This  being 
it is true isfiUed neither with sensation nor a manifold material 
nor with any other kind of onesided moments  purposes and 
determinations  it is  filled  with Spirit and is  known  by itself 
to be all  truth and reality  Suchjilling is  not identical with  its 
shape  Spirit qua  essence is  not identical with  its  consciousness 
Spirit is  actual as  absolute Spirit only when it is  also  for  itself 
in  its  truth  as  it is  in its  certainty  of itself  or when  the  extremes 
into which asconsciollsness it parts itselfare explicitly for each 
other in the shape of Spirit  The shape  which  Spirit assumes 
as  object of its  consciousness remains filled  by the certainty of 
Spirit as  by its  substance  through  this  content  the  object  is 

C  CC  RELIGION 

saved from  being degraded to  pure objectivity  to  the form  of 
negativity of selfwconsciousness  Spirits  immediate  llnitywith 
itselfis the basis or pure consciousness within which consciousw 
ness parts asunder into the  duality of subject and object  In 
this way Spirit shut up within its  pure selfconsdousness does 
not exist in religion as  the creator of a  Nature in general what 
it does create in this movement are its shapes qua Spirits which 
together constitute the completeness of its  manifestation  And 
this moyement itselfis the genesis ofits complete reality through 
its  individual  aspects  or through its  incomplete shapes 

  The first reality of Spirit is  the Notion of religion itself 
or religion as immediate and therefore Natural Religion In this 
Spirit knows itself as its object in a natural or immediate shape 
The second reality however is necessarily that in which Spirit 
knows  itself in  the shape of a superseded natural existence  or of 
the  self  This  therefore is  the  Religion  of Art for  the  shape 
raises itself to theform of the self through the creative  activity 
of consciousness wherehy this beholds irlitsobjectits actor the 
self  Finally the third  reality  overcomes  the  Qne  sidednessof 
thefirsttwo t slfisjust as much an immediacy as  theimme 
diacy  is  the self  If in the  first  reality  Spirit in generalis in 
theform of consciousness and in the second in that of selfconcid
sciousness  in  the  thirditis  in the form of the  unity of both 
It has the shape of heing  dn  andfor  itelf and when it is  thus 
conceived as it is in and for itelf this is the Revealed Religion 
But although in  this  Spirit has indeed  attained its  true shape 
yet  the  shape  itself and  the  picture  thoughtare  still  the  uncid
vanquished  aspeet  from which Spirit must  pass  over into  the 
Notion  in order wholly to  resolve  therein  the  form  of objec  
tivity  in the  Notion  which  equaUy  embraces  within itself its 
own opposite  It is  then  that Spirit has grasped  the Notion of 
itself just as  we now have first grasped it and its shape or the 
element of its  existence  being the Notion  is  Spirit itself 

A  NATURAL  RELIGION 

  The Spirit thatknows Spirit is consciousness of itself and 
is  present  to  itself in objective form  it  is  and  is  at  the  same 
time being that isfor itself  It isfor itself  it is  the  aspect of selfcid
consciousness and that too in contrast to  the aspect of its  con

NATURAL  RELIGION 

sciousness or of the relating of itself to itself as object  In its  concid
sciousness  there  is  antithesis  and  in  consequence  the  specific 
character of the  shape  in which it appears  to  itself and  knows 
itself  It is  solely  with  this  that  we  are  concerned  in  this 
treatment of religion for  we  have  already  considered  its  uncid
embodied essence or its pure Notion But at the same time  the 
difference  of consciousness  and selfconsciousness  falls  within 
the latter the shape of religion contains not the existence of 
Spirit as Nature that is free from thought nor as a  thought that 
is  free  fromexistence  but it is  an  existence  that is  preserved 
in  thinking  and  also  something  thought  that  is  objectively 
present to it  tis in accordance with  the specific  character of 
this shape in which Spirit knows itself that one religion is  discid
tinguished fromanother butwe have at the same timeto note 
thattheexposition of this knowledge of itself within the framecid
work of this  single  specific  character does  not  in  fact  exhaust 
the totality of an actual religion The series of different religions 
which will come  to  view  just as  much  sets  forth  again  only 
the  different  aspects  of a  single  religion  and  moreover  of 
every single religion  and  the ideas which seem  to  distinguish 
one  actual religion from  another  occur  in  each  one  At  the 
same  time  however  the  difference  must  also  be  viewed  as 
a  difference of religion  For since  Spirit lives in  the difference 
of its  consciousness  and  its  selfconscionsness  the  aim  of the 
movemen t  is  to  supersede  this  cardinal  distinction  and  to 
give  the  form  of seHconsciousness  to  the  shape  tha t  is  the 
object  of consciousness  But  this  difference  is  not  superseded 
simply  by  the  fact  that  the  shapes  contained  by  selfcon 
sciousness  have within them the moment of self  and that God 
is  thought of as selfconsciousness The self that is  thought of is  not 
the actualself in order that the self like any other more precise 
determination of shape may in  truth belong to  this  shape 
it must on  the one hand  be  posited in  the  shape  by  the  act 
ofsdfconsciousness and ontheother hand the lower determicid
nation mustshow itself to be reduced to a moment of the higher 
and  to  be comprehended  by  it  For what  is  thought  oj  ceases 
to  be something  merely  thought  of  something  alien  to  the 
selfs knowledge only when the selfhas produced it and therecid
fore  beholds  the  determination  of the  object as  its  own  concid
sequentlybeholds itselfin the object Through this activity the 

O    RELIGION 

lower determination has at the same time vanished for  the act 
is the negative that is realized at the expense of something else 
In  so  far  as  the  lower  determination  is  still  present  it  has 
retreated into an unessential aspect just as on the other hand 
where the lower is still dominant but the higher is  also  present 
the one determinatiDn devoid of self has its  place alongside  the 
other AccDrdingly if the various ideas within a particular relicid
gion do indeed exhibit the entire movement of its  shapes the 
character of each  idea  is  determined  by  the  particular  unity 
of consciousness and selfconsciousness in that religion ie  by 
the fact thatself  cDnsciousness embraces within itself the detercid
mination of the object Dfconsciousness by its act has completely 
appropriated it and knows it as  the essential determination in 
face  of the other  The truth of the belief in a  determination of 
the religious Spirit is  revealed in the fact  that the  constitution 
of the actual Spirit is similar to that of the shape in which Spirit 
beholds itself in the religionas eg  the incarnation  of God 
which  occurs  in  oriental  religion  has  no  truth  because  the 
actual Spirit oCthat religion  is  without  this  reconciliation  It 
is inappropriate here to return from  the totality of determina  
tions to the individ nal onesandtoshow inwhichsha pe within 
the totality and its  particular religion  the others are contained 
in  their completeness  The higher form  being placed  under a 
lower has stits significance for selfconsciousness  belongs  to 
it only superficially and to its  picturethought  It is  to  be  Concid
sidered in its proper significance only where it is  the  principle 
of this particular religion and is  upheld hy its actual Spirit 

a  God as  Light 

  Spirit as the essence that is selfconsciousnessor the selfcid

actuali tyw hich i t gives i tsdfin themovemen tofitsconsciousness 
And  thIS  Notion  is  as  contrasted  with  the  daylight  of this 
explicit development the night of its essence  as contrasted with 
the ou ter existence of its moments as  independen t shapes  it is 
the  creative  secret  of its  birth  This  secret  has  its  revelation 
within itself  for  the existence  of its  moments has  its  necessity 
in  this  Notion  because  this  Notion is  selfknowing Spirit and 

NATURAL  RELIGION 

therefore has in its essence the moment of being consciousness 
and of presenting itself objectivelyThis is  the pure which 
in its externalization has within itself as  universal object  the cercid
tainty of its  own self  or  in  other words  this  object is  for  the 
I  the  penetration of all  thought and all  reality 

  In the immediate first diremption ofself  knowing absocid

lute Spirit its  shape has  the  determination which  belongs  to 
immediate consciousness  or to sensecertainty  Spirit beholds itself 
in the form of being  though not of the nonspiritual being that 
is  filled  with  the  contingent determinations  of sensation  the 
being that belongs to sensecertainty on the contrary itis being 
that  is  filled  with  Spirit  It  also  includes  the  form  which 
appeared  in  immediate  selfconsciousness  the  form  of lord  and 
master over against the selfconsciousness  that retreats from  its 
object  This  being which is  filled  with the  Notion of Spirit is 
then the  shape J  of the simple  relation  of Spirit to itself  or the 
shape of shapelessness  In virtue  of this  determination  this 
shape  is  the  pure  allembracing  and  allpervading  essential 
light of sunrise  which  preserves itself in  its  formless  substanticid
ality  Its otherness is  the equally simple negative darkness  The 
movementsQf its  own externaHzation  its  creations in the  uncid
resis ting element of its otherness are torrents of light  in  their 
simplicity  they are at the same  time  the  genesis  of its  beingcid
forself and  the  return  from  the  exis tence  of its  momen ts  
streams  of  fire  destructive  of  all  structured  form  Thq 
moment of difference which it gives itself does it is  true  procid
liferate unchecked in the substance of existence and shapes itself 
to the forms of Nature yet the essential simplicity of its thought 
moves  aimlessly  about  in  it  without  stability  or  intelligence 
enlarges its  bounds  to  the  measureless  and its  beauty  heigh  
tened  to splendour is  dissolved in its  sublimity 

  The content developed by this pure being or the activity 

of its perceiving is therefore an essenceless by  play in this subcid
stance which merely ascends  without descending  into its  depths 
to become a  subject and through the self to consolidate its discid
tinct moments  The determinations of this substance  are only 
attributes which do  not  attain  to  selfsubsistence but  remain 
merely names  of the  manynamed  One  This  One  is  clothed 
with the manifold powers of existence and with the shapes of 
reality as with an adornment that lacks  a self  they are merely 

 
messengers having no will of their own messengers of its might 
visions  of its  glory  voices  in  its  praise 

C  CC  RELIGION 

  However  this  reeling  unconstrained  Life  must detercid

mine  itself as  beingfor  self and  endow  its  vanishing  shapes 
with  an enduring subsistence  The immediate  being  in  which  it 
stands in antithesis to its consciousness is itself the negative power 
which dissolves its distinctions  It is  thus in  truth the Self and 
S piri t therefore passes on to know itself in the form of self  Pure 
Light disperses its unitary nature into an infinity of forms  and 
offers  up itself as  a  sacrifice  to  beingforself  so  that  from  its 
substance  the individual  may  take  an  enduring  existence  for 
itself 

b  Plant  and animal 

  Selfconscious Spirit that has withdrawn into itselffrom 
the  shapeless  essence  or  has  raised  its  immediacy  to self in 
general  determines  its  unitary  nature  as  amanifoldness  of 
being  forselfand is  the  religion  of spiritual perception  In  this 
it  falls  apart into  the  numberless  multiplicity  of weaker  and 
stronger richer and  poorer Spirits  This  pantheism which  to 
begin with is  the  passive  subsistence  of these  spiritual  atoms 
develops into a  hostile movement within itself  The innocence 
of the flower  relzgion  which  is  merely  the  selfless  idea of self 
gives place to the earnestness ofwarring life to  the guilt of anicid
mal religions  the passivity and impotence of contemplative in  
dividuality pass  into destructive  beingforself  It is  of no  use 
to  have  taken from  the  things  of perception  the  deadness  of 
abstraction and tohave raised  them to beings of spiritual per 
ception the  ensoulment of this  kingdom  of Spirits  bears  this 
death within it owing to the determinateness and the negativity 
which  encroach  upon  the  innocent  indifference  of plant life 
Through this negativity  the dispersion into the  multiplicity of 
passive plant forms  becomes a  hostile  movement in  which  the 
hatred which stems from  beingfor  self is  aroused  The  actual 
selfconsciousness of this  dispersed  Spirit is  a  host of separate 
antagonistic national Spirits who hate and fight  each other  to 
the  death  and  become  conscious  of specific  forms  of animals 
as  their essence for  they  are  nothing else  than animal spirits 
animal lives  which separate  themselves  off from  one  another 
and are  unconscious  of their universality 

NATURAL  RELIGION 

 

  In this  hatred however  the determinateness of purely 

negative beingforselfconsumes itself  and through this  movecid
ment of the Notion Spirit enters into another shape Superseded 
beingJorselfis theform of the object  a  form produced by the self 
or rather is  the  produced self  the selfconsuming self  ie  the 
self that becomes  a  Thing  The artificer  therefore  retains  the 
upper hand over these mutually destructive animal spirits and 
his  action  is  not  merely  negative  but  tranquil  and  positive 
Spirits consciousness is thus now the movement which is above 
and beyond the  immediate  initself as  it is  above  and  beyond 
the  abstract  beingforself  Since  the  initself  is  reduced 
through opposition  to being a  determinateness it is  no longer 
the proper form of absolute Spirit but a  reality which its concid
sciousnessfinds confronting it as an ordinary existent thing and 
which it supersedes at the same time  this  consciousness is  not 
only this  beingforself which supersedes its  object  but it also 
produces its own idea the beingforself that is  put forth in the 
form of an object  This productive activity  however is  not a 
perfectbut a conditioned activity the fashioning of a  material 
already  to  hand 

c  The artificer 

  Spirit  therefore  here  appears  as  an  artijicer  and  its 
action whereby it produces itself as object but without having 
yet grasped the thought of itself is an instinctive operation like 
the building of a  honeycomb  by bees 

  The first form because it is  immediate is  the abstract 
form of the Understanding and the work is  not yet in its  own 
self filled  with  Spirit  The  crystals  of pyramids  and  obelisks 
simple  combinations of straight lines with  plane  surfaces  and 
equal proportions  of parts  in  which  the  incommensurability 
of the  round is  destroyed  these  are  the  works  of this  artificer 
of rigid form  On account of the merely abstract intelligibleness 
of the form the significance of the workis not in the work itself 
is not the spiritual self Thus either the works receive Spirit into 
them only as an alien departed spirit that has forsaken its Hving 
saturation with reality and being itself dead takes up its abode 
in this lifeless crystal or they have an external relation to S piri t 
as something which is itself there externally and not as Spirit

 

C  CC  RELIGION 

they are related  to it as  to  the  dawning  light  which  casts  its 
significance  on  them 

  The division from which the artificerspirit startsthe 

in  itself which he comes  the  material it fashions  and the beingcid
forself which  is  the  aspect of selfconsciousness  at  workthis 
division has become objective to it in its work Its further efforts 
must aim  at getting rid  of this  division  of soul  and  body  to 
clothe and give shape to soul in its own self and to endow body 
with  soul  The  two  aspects  in  being  brought  closer  to  each 
other retain the specific character of Spirit as ideally conceived 
and as  its  enveloping  husk  Spirits  unity  with  itself contains 
this antithesis of individuality and universality Since the work 
in the comingtogether of its aspects comes closer to itself  this 
at the same  time  produces  another  result  viz  that  the  work 
comes closer to the selfconsciousness performing it and that the 
latter in the work comes  to know itself as  it is  in its  truth But 
in this way the work at first constitutes only the abstract aspect 
of the activity  of Spirit  which  does  not yet  know  the  content 
of this activity within itself but in its work  which  is  a Thing 
The artificer himself Spirit in its entirety has not yet appeared 
but is  the still  inner  hidden essence  which  as  an  entirety  is 
presenT  only as  divided into  active  selfconsciousness  apd  the 
object it has  produced 

  The  surrounding  habitation  then  the  outcr  reality 
which has been raised at first only into the abstract form of the 
Understanding is fashioned by the artificer into a more lifelike 
form For this purpose he employs plantlife which is no longer 
sacred as it was to the earlier impotent pantheism on the concid
trary  the artificer  who grasps  himself as  the  being  that  is jar 
itself  takes  that plant life  as something to  be used and reduces 
it to an outer aspect  to a  mere  ornament  But it is  not  used 
unaltered for the artificer of the selfconscious form at the same 
time destroys the transitoriness inherent in the immediate existcid
ence of this life and brings its organic forms  nearer to  the more 
rigid and more  universal forms  of thought  The organic form 
which  left  to  itself  proliferates  unchecked  in  particularity 
being itself subjugated  by  the  form  of thought  in  turn  raises 
these  rectilinear flat  shapes  into  a  roundness  more  typical  of 
the organic forma blending which becomes  the root of free 
architecture 

NATURAL  RELIGION 

  This  dwelling  the  aspect of the  universal  element  or  incid

organic nature  of Spirit  now  also  includes  within  it  a  shape 
of individuality which brings nearer to actuality the Spirit that 
previously was  separated from  existence  and was  external  or 
internal  to  it  and  thereby makes  the  work  more in  harmony 
with active selfconsciousness The artificer lays hold first of all 
of the  form  of beingforself in  general  of the  animal  shape 
That he is  no longer conscious of himself immediately in  animal 
life  he proves by constituting himself the productive power in 
relation to It  and knows  himself in  it as  in his  work  whereby 
the animal shape at the same time becomes superseded and the 
hieroglyph  of another  meaning  of a  thought  Consequently 
the shape too is no longer solely and entirely used by the artificid
cer butis blended with  the shape of thought with the human 
form  But  the  work  still  lacks  the  shape  and outer  reality  in 
which the self exists as  self it still does not in  its  own self procid
claim  that  it  includes  within  it  an  inner  meaning  it  lacks 
speech  the  element  in  which  the  meaning  filling  it is  itself 
present  Therefore the work even when it is wholly  purged of 
the animalelement and wears only the shape of selfconsciouscid
ness is stilLthe soundless shape which needs the rays of the rising 
sun in order to  have sound which  generated by light  is  even 
then merely noise and not speech  and reveals  only  an  outer 
not the inner  self 

  Over against this outer shape of the selfstands the other 
shape which proclaims its  possession  of an  inner  being  Nature 
withdrawing into its essence deposes its living selfparticularizcid
ing  selfentangling  manifold  existence  to  the  level  of an uncid
essential husk which is  the covering for  the  inner  being  and this 
inner  being is  in  the  first  instance  still  simple  darkness  the 
unmoved  the  black formless  stone  The  Black  Stone  in  the 
Kaaba at Mecca 

  Both representations contain inwardness and outer excid

istcpcethe two moments of Spirit and  both  representations 
contain  the  two  moments at once in  an  antithetical  relation 
the selfboth as  inner and as  outer The two have to be united 
The soul of the statue in human shape does not yet come forth 
from the inner being is not yet speech the outer existence that 
is in its own self inward and the inner being of multiform existcid
ence is  still  soundless  is  not immanently differentiated  and  is 

C  CC  RELIGION 

still separated from  its  outer existence  to  which  all  differences 
belong  The artificer therefore unites  the  two  by  blending the 
natural and the selfconscious shape and this ambiguous being 
which is a riddle to itself the conscious wrestling with the noncid
conscious the simple inner with the multiform outer the darkcid
ness of thought mating with the clarity of utterance these break 
out into  the language  of a  profound  hut scarcely  intelligible 
wisdom 

  In  this  work  there  is  an  end  of the  instinctive  effort 
which produced the work that in contrast to selfconsciousness 
lacked consciousnessfor in it the activity of the artificer which 
constitutes selfconsciousness comes face to face with an eq ually 
selfconscious selfexpressive inner being  In it he has worked 
himself  up  to  the  point  where  his  consciousness  is  divided 
against itself  where  Spirit  meets  Spirit  In  this  unity of selfcid
conscious Spirit with itself  in so  far as  itis the  shape and the 
object of its  consciousness  its  blendings with the  unconscious 
shapes  are  purged of the  immediate shapes of Nature  These 
monsters in shape worciand deed are dissolved  into spiritual 
shape into an outerthathas retreated into itselfandan inner 
that utters  or expresses itself outof itself and in its  own self 
into thought which  begets  itself  which  preserves  its  shape in 
harmony with itself and is a lucid intelligible existence  Spirit 
is  Artist 

B  RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM  OF  ART 

  Spirit has raised the shape in which  it is  present to  its 
own  consciousness  into  the form  of consciousness  itself and it 
producessuch a shape for itself  The artificer has given up the 
synthetic effort to blend the heterogeneous forms of thought and 
natural objects now that the shape has gained thefbfm ofsef 
conscious activity  he has  become a  spiritual worker 

  Ifwe ask which is  the actual Spirit which  has  the  concid

sciousness of its absolute essence in thcreligion of art we  find 
that it is  the ethical or the true Spirit This is  not merely theunicid
versal substance of all  individuals on  the contrary since  this 
substance has for actual consciousness the shape of consciousness 
and it is  individualized it follows  that the substance is  known 
by  the individuals  as  their  own  essence  and  their  own  work 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF  AR T 

 
It is for them neither the divine essential Light in whose unity 
the  beingforself of selfconsciousness  is  contained  only  negacid
tively  only  transitorily  and in which it beholds  the lord  and 
master of its  actual world  nor is  it the  restless  destruction  of 
hostile  peoples  nor  their  subjection  to  a  castesystem  which 
gives the semblance of organization of a  completed whole but 
in which  the  universal  freedom  of the  individuals  is  lacking 
On the contrary this Spirit is  the free nation in which hallowed 
custom constitutes the substance of all whose actuality and excid
istence each and everyone knows  to  be his  own will  and  deed 

  The religion of the ethical Spirit is  however its  elevacid

tion  above  its  real  world  the  withdrawal  from  its  truth into 
the  pure  knowledge  of itself  Since  the  ethical  nation  lives  in 
immediate  unity with its  substance  and lacks  the  principle  of 
the pure individuality of selfconsciousness  the complete form 
of its  religion first  appears as  divorced from  its  existential shape 
Bestehen For the reality of the ethical substance rests  partly 
on its passive unchangeableness as contrasted with the absolute 
movement of selfconsciousness  and consequently on the fact 
that  this selfconstiousness  has  not  yet  withdrawn  into  itself 
from  its  contented  acceptance  of custom  and  its  firm  trust 
therein  Partly  too  on its  organization into  a  multiplicity  of 
rights and duties as  also on its distribution into the sphere of 
the various classes and their particular activi ties which coopercid
ate to form the whole and hence on the fact that the individual 
is  content with  the  limitation of his  existence and has  not yet 
grasped the  unrestricted thought of his free self  But that trancid
quil immediate trust in the substance turns back into trust in onecid
self and  into  the  certainty  of oneself  and  the  multiplicity  of 
rights and duties like the restricted activity is the same dialecticid
cal moyement of the ethical sphere as  the m ul ti plicity of things 
and theirspedfic naturesa movement which finds its rest and 
stability only in  the  simplicity  of the  Spirit  that  is  certain  of 
itself The consummation of the ethical sphere iu free selfconcid
sciousness and the fate  of the  ethical  world  are  therefore  the 
individuality that has withdrawn into itself  the absolute levity 
of the  ethical  Spirit  which  has  dissolved  within  itself all  the 
firmly  established  distinctions  of its  stable  existence  and  the 
spheres of its  organically  ordered  world  and  being  perfectly 
sure of itself  has  attained  to  unrestrained joyfulness  and  the 

c  ce  RELIGION 

freest enjoyment of itself This simple certainty of Spirit within 
itselfhas a twofold meaning it is  a  serene stable existence and 
settled truth and also absolute unrest and the passingaway of 
the ethical order But it changes round into  the  latter for  the 
truth of the ethical Spirit is  in the first instance still  only  this 
substantial essence  and trust in  it  in  which  the  self does  not 
know itself as  a free individuality and which therefore in  this 
inwardness or in the liberation of the self perishes Since then 
its  trust  is  broken  and  the  substance  of the  nation  bruised 
Spirit which hitherto mediated the unstable extremes has now 
stepped forth as  an extreme that of selfconsciousness grasping 
itself as  essence  This  is  Spirit  inwardly  sure  of itself  which 
mourns  over  the  loss  of its  world  and  now  out of the  purity 
of self creates  its  own  essence  which  is  raised  above  the  real 
world 

  In such an epoch  absolute art makes  its  appearance 

Prior  to  this  it is  an  instinctive  fashioning  of material  subcid
merged in the world of determinate being it works its way Ollt 
of it and into it it does not possesshs substance in the free  ethicid
cal  sphere  tnd  therefore  does  not have  the  fharacter  of free 
spiritual activity for the sefat work Later on Spirit transcends 
art in order to  gain a  higher representation of itself  viz  to  be 
not merely the substance  born of the self  but to  be in its reprecid
sentation as object this slj not only to give birth to itself from 
its Notion but to have its very Notion for its shape so  that the 
Notion and the work of art produced know  each other as  one 
and  the sam 

  The ethical substance having withdrawn from its outer 
existence back into its pure selfconsciousness  this is  the aspect 
of the  Notion  or of the  activity  with  which  Spirit brings  itself 
forth as  object This activity is  pure form  because  the  indivicid
dual in ethical obedience and service has worked off every uncid
conscious  existence and fixed  determination in  the  same  way 
that substance itself has  become  this  fluid  essnce This  form 
is  the  night in which substance was  betrayed and  made  itself 
in to Subject It is aut of this  nigh t of pure certainty of self tha t 
the  ethical  Spirit is  resurrected  as  a  shape freed  from  Nature 
and  its  own  immediate existence 

  The concrete existence  of the  pure Notion  into which 
Spirit has fled from its body is an individual which Spirit selects 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF ART 

to be the vessel of its sorrow Spirit is  present in this individual 
as his universal and as the power over him from which he suffer 
violence  as  his  pathos by  giving  himself over  to  which  his 
selfconsciousness loses  its freedom  But that positive  power of 
universality  is  subdued  by  the  pure self of the individual  the 
negative power This pure activity conscious of its inalienable 
strength  wrestles  with  the  shapeless  essence  Becoming  its 
master it has made the pathos into its material and given itself 
its  content and this  unity emerges  as  a  work  universal  Spirit 
individualized and set  before  us 

a  The  abstract  work  of art 

  The first work of art as  immediate is  abstract and incid

dividual As for itself it has to move away from  this  immediate 
and objective mode towards selfconsciousness  while selfconcid
sciousness  on  the  other hand  in  the  cult  aims  at  getting  rid 
of the  distinction  by which  it  distinguishes  itself at first  from 
its  Spiritand  by so  doing  to  produce  a  work  of art which  is 
in its  own selfanimate 

  The first mode in which the artistic spirit keeps its shape 
and  its  active  consciousness  farthest  apart  is  the  immediate 
mode viz  the shape is  there  or is  immediately  present simply  as 
a thing  In this mode the shape is broken up into the distinction 
of individuality which bears within it the shape of the self and 
of  universality  which  represents  the  inorganic  essence  in 
reference  to  the shape  its  environment and  habitation  This 
shape through the raising of the whole into  the pure Notion 
acquires its pure spiritually appropriate form  It is neither the 
 crystal  the  form  characteristic  of the  Understanding  which 
houses  the  dead  or is  illumined  by a  soul  outside  of it  nor is 
it that blending of the forms  of Nature and  of thought which 
first  emerged from  the  plant  thoughes  activity  in  this  being 
stiIJan imitation On the contrary the Notion strips off the traces 
of root  branches  and  leaves  still  adhering  to  the forms  and 
purifies the latter into shapes in which the crystals straight lines 
and flat surfaces are raised into incommensurable ratios so that 
the ensoulment of the organic is  taken up into the abstract form 
of the  Understanding  and  at  the  same  time  its  essential 
natureincommensurabilityis  preserved  for  the  Undercid
standing

  But the indwelling god is  the Black Stone  drawn  forth 
from  its  animal covering and  pervaded with  the  light of con  
sciousness  The human form  strips  off the  animal  shape  with 
which it was blended the animal is for the god merely an accim 
dental guise it steps alongside its true shape and no longer has 
any worth on its own account but is reduced to signifying somem 
thing else and has sunk  to  the  level  of a  mere symbol  By  this 
very fact  the shape of the god in its  own self strips off also  the 
poverty of the natural conditions of animal existence and hints 
at the internal dispositions of animal life melted into its  surface 
and  belonging only  to  this  surface  The  essential  being  of the 
god is  however  the  unity of the universal existence of Nature 
and of selfconscious Spirit which in its actuality confronts the 
former At the same time being in the first instance an indzvidual 
shape its existence is  one of the elements of Nature just as  its 
selfconscious actuality is an individual national Spirit But the 
former  is  in  this  unity  that  element  reflected  into  Spirit 
Nature transfigured by thought and  united with selfconscious 
life  The  form  of the  gods  has  therefore  its  Natureelement 
within  it as  a  transcended  moment  as  a  dim  memory   The 
chaoticheing and confused strife ofthefreelycexisting elements 
the unethical realm of the  Titans  is  conquered and banished 
to  the fringes  of an actuality  that  has  become  transparent to 
itself  to the obscure boundaries of the world which finds  itself 
in  the sphere of  Spirit and is  there  at peace  These ancient 
gods firstborn  children  of the  union  of Ligh t  with Darkness 
Heaven  Earth Ocean  Sun  the  Earths blind  typhonic  Fire 
and so  on  are supplanted  by shapes which only  dimly  recall 
those Titans and which are no longer creatures of Nature but 
lucid  ethical  Spirits  of selfconscious nations 

  This sim pIe sha pe has th us rid itselfof the unrest of endcid
less  individuation both of its  Natureelement which only qua 
universal essence is  ruled  by necessity  but in its existence and 
activity is  open  to  contingency  and of the  nation  which  discid
persed in to particular spheres of activity and individ ual centres 
of selfconsciousness  has  an  existence  which  is  manifold  in 
meaning and activity  All  this  individuation  has  been  got  rid 
of by  this simple form and brought together into an  individu  
ality that is  at rest  This  individuality is  therefore confronted 
by the moment of unrest itthe essenceis confronted by self

consciousness for which as  the birthplace of that unrest nothing 
remains except to be pureactivity What belongs to the substance 
the artist gave entirely to his work but to himself as  a particular 
indivduality he gave in his work no actual existence  he could 
impart perfection to  his work  only  by emptying himself of his 
particularity depersonalizing himself and rising to  the abstrac 
tion  of pure  action  In  this  first  immediate  production  the 
separation of the work from his selfconscious activity is  not yet 
restored to their unity The work by itselfis not therefore actu  
ally an inspired work it is a whole only together with its genesis 
The common element in a  work of art viz  that it is  produced 
in consciousness and is  made by human hands  is  the  moment 
of the Notion existing qua  Notion  which stands in contrast to 
the work  And if this Notion whether in the shape of artist or 
spectator is  unselfish  enough  to  declare  the  work  of art to be 
in its own self absolutely inspired and to forget himself as  percid
former  or as  spectator  then against this  we  must  stick  to  the 
Notion  of Spirit which  cannot  dispense  with  the  moment  of 
being conscious  of itself  This  moment  however  stands  concid
trasted  with  the  work  because  in  this  initial  duality  of itself 
Spirit gives  the  two sides  their abstract  contrasted characters 
of action  and of being a Thing and  their return into  the unity 
from  which  they proceeded has  not yet come  about 

  The artist then learns in his work that he did not procid

duce a being like  himself  From it  it is  true  there comes  back 
to  him  a  consciousness  in  the sense  that an  admiring  crowd 
reveres it as the Spirit which is  their own essence  But this  in 
spiration since it returns to  him  his  selfconsciousness  only as 
admiration is rather a confession to  the artist that the inspired 
work is  not on the same level as  himself  Since his  work  comes 
back to him simply  as joyfulness  he does  not find  therein  the 
painful labour of making himselfinto an artist and of creation 
nor the strain and effort of his  work  Furthermore  the  crowd 
may judge the  work or bring it offerings  endue  it with  their 
own consciousness in whatever way it may be if they with their 
knowledge set themselves above it  he  knows  how  much more 
his aclis than what they understand and say if they put themcid
selves  below it and recognize in it the essence which  dominates 
them  he  knows  himself as  the master of this heing 

  The work of art therefore demands another elemen t of 

C  CC  RELIGION 

its existence  the god another mode of coming forth  than  this 
in which  out of the  depths  of his  creative night  he  descends 
into the opposite into externality into the determination of the 
Thing  which  lacks  selfconsciousness  This  higher  element  is 
Languagean outer reality that is  immediately selfconscious 
existence  Just as  the  individual  slfconsciousness is  immediately 
present in language so it is  also  immediately present as  a  unicid
versal infection the complete separation into independent selves 
is  at the same time  the  fluidity  and the  universally communicid
cated  unity  of the  many selves  language  is  the  soul  existing 
as soul  The god therefore who has language for  the element 
of his  shape is  the  work  of art that is  in  its  own  self inspired 
that  possesses  immediately  in  its  outer  existence  the  pure 
activity which when it existed as  a  Thing  was  in contrast  to 
it  In other words  selfconsciousness  in  the  objectification  of 
its  essence  abides  mmediately with itself  Abiding thus  with 
itselfin its essence it is pure thought or the devotion whose inwardcid
ness  in  the  hymn  has  at  the  same  time  an  outer  existence  It 
retains within itself the individuaHty of selfconsciousnessand 
this individuality is at thesame time heard as a universal indivicid
duality that is  immediately present  Devotion kindled  in  the 
manifold units of self consciousness isconsciousofitsactas the 
act of all alike and as simple being Spirit as  this  universal  selfcid
consciousness  of all  has  its  pure inwardness no  less  than  the 
beingforothers and  the  beingforself of the individuals in a 
single  unity 

 L  This language is  distinct from another language of the 
god which isnot that of universal selfconsciousness The Oracle 
both of the god of the religions of art and of the preceding relicid
gions is the necessary firstform of the gods  utterance for the 
NJtion  of the god implies that he is  the essence of both Nature 
and Spirit and therefore has not only natural but spiritual excid
istence as well In so far as this moment is at first merely jmplied 
in his  Notion  and  not yet realized  in  religion  the language is 
for the religious selfconsciousness the language of an alien  selfcid
consciousness The selfconsciousness that is still alien to its com  
munity is  not yet  immediately present in  the  manner demanded 
by its Notion  The self is  simple or unitary  and  thereby absocid
I utely universal beingorselJ  but the self that is  sepal ated from 
the selfconsciousness of the community is at first only an zndivi

dual  self  The content of this  its  own  and individual language 
stems  from  the  universal  determinateness  in  which  absolute 
Spirit in  general is  posited  in  its  religion  Thus  the  universal 
Spirit of the Sunrise which has not yet particularized its  existcid
ence utters equally simple and universal statements about the 
divine Being  the substantial content of which is sublime in  its 
sirnple  truth  but on  account  of this  universality  at  the  same 
time  appears  trivial  to  the  progressively  developing  selfconcid
sciousness 

 

   The  further  developed  self which  rises  to  become  a 
beingforselfis master over the pure pathos of substance over 
the objectivity of the Light of Sunrise and knows that simplicity 
of truth as essenlialbeing which does not have the form of contincid
gent existence through an alien speech knows it as  the sure  and 
unwritten  taU  of the gods  a law  that  is  everlasting  and no  one  knows 
whence  it came  Just as  the universal truth which was  revealed 
by the di vin Light has here withdra wninto the inner or nether 
world of being  and is  thus freed  from  the form  of contingent 
existence n the other hand in the religion  of art because

as  that which possesses  esentia  being are claimed by conscwus

manner  When  the  individual  by  using  his  understanding 
makes  up  his  mind  and  after  deliberation  chooses  what  is 
advantageous for  him  this selfdetermination is  based  on  the 
specific  nature of his  particular character  This  latter is  itself 
contingent  and  therefore  knowledge  supplied  by  the  undercid
standing as  to  what is  advantageous for  the individual  is  just 
such a knowledge as that of the oracles or of the lot only that 
he who questions the oracle or loe thereby expresses the ethical 
sentiment  of indifference  to  what  is  contingent  while  the 
former on  the other hand  treats what is  intrinsically contincid
gent  as  an  important  concern  of his  thinking  and  knowing 
What  is  higher  than  both  however  is  not  only  to  make 
deliberation the Oracle for a contingent action but in addition 
to know that this deliberate action is itself something contingent 
on account of its  connection with the  particular aspect of the 
action and of its  advan tageousness 

  The true selfconscious existence which Spirit receives 
in speech which is not the utterance of an alien  and  therefore 
contingent not univrsalselfeonsdousness is  the work of art 
we  met  with  before  It stands  in contrast  to  the  Thinglike 
character of the statue  Whereas this  exists  at rest  speech is  a 
vanishing existenceanrl  whereas  in the statue  theliberated 
objectivity lacks an imrnediatesdffitsownin speech on the

  The  movement  of the  two  sides  constitutes  the  Cult 
a  movement in  which  the  divine shape  in motion  in  the  pure 
feeling element  of selfconsciousness  and  the  divine  shape at 
rest in  the dement of thinghood mutually surrender their dis 
tinctivecharacters and the unity which is  the  Notion of their 
essence achieves an existence  In the  Cult  the self gives  itself 
the consciousness of the divine Being descending  to  it from its 
remoteness  and  this  divine  Being  which  formerly  was  not 
actual  but  only  an  object  over  against  it  through  this  act 
receives  the actuality proper to  selfconsciousness 

   This Notion of the CuI t is  already m plicitly contained 
and  present in  the stream of sacred song  This  devotion  is  the 
immediate pure satisfaction of the self by and within  itself  It 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF  ART 

 
is  the purified soul which in this purity is directly only essence 
and is one with essence The soul because of its abstract characcid
ter  is  not  consciousness  which  distinguishes  its  object  from 
itself it is  thus only the night of its existence and the place precid
pared for its   outer shape  The abstract Oult therefore  raises 
the self into  being this  pure divine element  The soul  perfects 
this  purification with consciousness  Yet  it  is  still  not  the  self 
that has descended into its  depths and knows itself as  evil but 
it is  something  that only immediately  is  a  soul  that cleanses  its 
exterior by washing it and puts on white robes while its inward 
being traverses  the  imaginatively  conceived  path  of works 
punishments  and  rewards  the  path  of spiritual  training  in 
general  ie  of ridding itself of its  particularity  as  a  result  of 
which it reaches the dwellings and the community of the blest 
 I   This Oult is at first only a secret fulfilment  Le  a  fulfilcid

ment only in imagination not in actuality It must be an actual 
deed for a deed tha t is notatual isselfcon tradictory Consciouscid
ness  proper thereby raises  itself into its pure  selfconsciousness 
The  divine  Being  has  in  this  the  meaning  of a  free  object 
through the  actuaICult  this  object returns into  the self  and 
in so far  as  it has in  pure  consciousness  the  meaning of the 
pure divine Being dwelling beyond reality this Being descends 
from its  universality  through  the  mediation of the  Oult  into 
individuality  and  thus  unites  itself with reality 

   The way the two sides enter into the act is  determined 
as follows for the selfconscious aspect so far as it is  actual con 
sciousness  the  divine  Being presents itself as  actual  Nature  on 
the one hand Nature belongs  to consciousness as  its  possession 
and property  and  has  the  value  of an  existence  that has  no 
being of its  own  On the other hand  Natgre is  consciousnesss 
own  immediate  actuality  and  individuality  which  equally  is 
regarded as a nonessential being and is stripped of its apparent 
independence  But  for  its  pure  consciousness  this  external 
Nature has at the same  time  the opposite  meaning viz  of being 
the  implicitly  divine  Being  for  which the self sacrifices  its  uncid
essential being just as  coversely it sacrifices  the  unessential 
aspect ofN alure to itself  This makes  the act a spiritual move 
ment  because  it is  this  twofold  process  on  the  one  hand  of 
superseding  the  abstraction  of the  divine  Being  which  is  how 
devotion determines its object  and  making it actual  and  on 

 

C  CC  RELIGION 

the  other  hand  of superseding  the  actual  which  is  how  the 
doer determines  the object and himself  and raising it into  a 
universality 

   The actofthe Cult itselfbegins therefore with the pure 
surrender  of a  possession  which  the  owner  apparently  without 
any profit whatever to  himself  pours  away  or  lets  rise  up  in 
smoke  In so doing he renounces before  the essence of his  pure 
consciousness  all  possession  and  right  of  the  property  and 
enjoyment thereof  renounces his  personality and the  return 
of his act into himself and he reflects the act into the universal 
or into the divine Being  rather than into himself  Conversely 
however  the divine BeiQg in its  immediacy  also  perishes  in this 
act The animal sacrificed is  the symbol of a god the fruits concid
sumed  are  the  living  Ceres  and  Bacchus  themselves  In  the 
former  die  the powers of the  upper law which  has  blood  and 
actual life in the latter the  powers of the  lower law  that pos  
sesses in bloodless form secret and cunning power The sacrifice 
of the divine substance in  so  far  as  it  is  an ac  belongs  to  the 
selfqmscJQus  aspect  that  this  aqtual  deed  bepossihle  the 
diyineBeiqg rnutlready have sacrificed itseJfinprincipl This 
ithas done by giving itseif an  outer  existenqe  and has  made 
itself into  an  individual  animal  and  into fruit  This  renuncid
ciation 
the  divine  Behtg  has  already 
accomplished inprinciplc is shown forth hy theselfwhoperforms 
the sacrifice as  an existent fact  and for  his  own consciousness 
tbus  rplacing that immediate  actuality ofthe divine Being  by 
the higher aStulity viz  that of himself  For the  unity which 
has resulted from overcoming the ilglenes and separation of 
the  two sides  is  not merely a  negative fate  but has  a  positive 
significance  It is  only to  the abstract being of the  underworld 
that the saqificial offering is  wholly surrendered and thus  the 
rftection of possessions and beingforself into the  universal  is 
qistinguished from thesefas such At the same time however 
tpis is only a small part ang  the other act of sacrifice is  merely 
the destruction of what cannot be  used  and is  really  the precid
paration of the offering for a meal the feast  that cheats the act 
out of its negative significance At that first sacrifice the person 
making  the  offering  reserves  the  greatest  share  for  his  own 
enjoyment and from the latter sacrifice what is  useful for the 
same purpose This enjoyment is the negative power which puts 

therefore  which 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM  OF  ART 

 
an end both  to  the divine  Being and  to  the  singleness  and  it 
is  at the same time the positive  actuality in  which  the objective 
existence of the  divine  Being  is  transformed  into selfconscious 
existence  and  the self has  consciousness  of its  unity  with  the 
divine Being 

  For the rest though this Cult is in fact an act its meancid

ing yet lies mostly in devotion What belongs to devotion is  not 
objectively produced just as  the  result  in  the  enjoyment  of 
the feast is itself robbed of its outer existence The Cult therecid
fore  goes further and replaces  this  defect  in  the  firstinstance 
by giving its devotion an enduring objective existence since the 
Cult is  the common taskor the individual task  for each and 
all  to dow hich prod uces  a  dwelling and adornmen ts  for  the 
glory of the god By so doing in part the objectivity of the statue 
is  transcended for  by  this  dedication of his  gifts  and labours 
the labourer inclines the god to look favourably upon him and 
contemplates his self as  belonging to the god  In part too this 
action is  not the individual labour of the artist this  particular 
aspect of it being dissolved  in  universality  But it is  not  only 
theglolY of the god that is  accomplished  and  the  blessing of 
his favourshedon the laboureronlyideally and in imagination 
the work has also a  meaning the reverse of the first  which was 
that of alienating and glorifying something alien  The dwellcid
ings and halls of the god are for  the  use  of man  the treasures 
preserved therein are his  own in case of need the honour and 
glory enjoyed by the god in his adornment are the honour and 
glory of the nation  great in soul and inartistic achievement 
At  the  festival  this  people  adorns  its  own  dwellings  and 
garments  no  less  than  the  things  of the  god  with  graceful 
decorations  In this way they receive  from  the  grateful god  a 
return for their gifts and proofs of his favour in which through 
their  work  they became  united  with  him  not  as  a  hope  and 
in  a  future  realization  but rather  in witnessing  to  his  glory 
and  in  bringing  him  gifts  the  nation  has  the  immediate 
enjoyment of its  own wealth and adornment 
b  The  living  work  of art 

  The nation  that approaches its  god  in  the  Cult of the 
religion of art is  the ethical nationthat knows its state and the 
actions  of the state  to  be  the  wil  and  the  achievement  of its 

c  ce  RELIGION 

own self  This Spirit  confronting the selfconscious  nation  is 
therefore  not  the  divine  Light which  being  devoid  of a  self 
does  not con tain within it the self  certainty of the  individuals 
but is only their universal essence and the lordly power in which 
they disappear  The Cult of the  religion  of this  simple  amorcid
phous essence gives  back  to  its  votaries  therefore  in  general 
merely this  that they are the  people of their god who secures 
for  them only  their enduring existence and  their substance  as 
such  not  however  their  actual  self which  on  the  contrary 
is  rejected  For they  reverence  their god as  the  empty Depth  
not as  Spirit  But the  Cult of the  religion  of art on  the  other 
hand is without that abstract simplicity of the essence and therecid
fore  of its  depth  That  essence  however  which  is  immediately 
united with the selfis in itself Spirit and the truth that is a knowing 
thoughstill not the truth thatisknown or the truth that knows 
itselfin the depths of its nature Because then the essence here 
contains a self its  manifestation is  well  disposed  towards concid
sciousness and in the Cult consciousness receives not only the 
generalsanction of its enduring existencehu talso its conscious 
existencein the Cult itselfjustas conversely the essence does 
not have an actuality devoid of self in arejected people whose 
subs tancemerely is acknowledged  bu tin the people whose self 
is  acknowledged  iuits substance 

 L  Self  consciousness  then  comes  forth  from  the  Cult 
satisfied in its essence and the god enters in t t as into its ha bitacid
tion  This habitation is  by itself  the  night of Substance or its 
 pureindividuality but no longer the tense individuality of the 
artist an individuality which has not yet reconciled itself with 
its  essence  that is  in  process  of  becoming  objective  it  is  the 
satisfied  night  of  substance  which  has  its  pathos  within 
hand  is  not  in  need  of anything  because  it  returns  from 
intuition from  the  objectivity  that has  been superseded 

This  pathos  is  by  itself  the  Being  of the  risen  Sun  but 
a  Being which  has  now  et  within itself  and  has its  setting 
or goingdown ieselfconsciGusnessand hence existence and 
actualitywithin itself  It has  here traversed the  movement of 
its actualization  Coming down from  its  pure essential  nature 
and becoming an objective force of Nature and the expressions 
of that force it is an outer existence for the other for  the self 
by which it is  consumed  The silent essence of selfless  Nature 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF  ART 

 
in  its  fruits  attains  to  that  stage  where  self  prepared  and 
digested  it offers  itself to life  that has  a  selflike  nature  In its 
usefulness  as  food  and drink it  reaches  its  highest  perfection 
for in  this  it is  the possibility of a  higher existence and comes 
into contact  with  spiritual  reality  In  its  metamorphosis  the 
EarthSpirit  has  developed  partly  into  a  silently  energizing 
Substance partly intoa spiritual fermentation in the first case 
it  is  the  feminine  principle  of nourishment  in the  other  the 
masculine principle the selfimpelling force ofselfconscious excid
istence 

  In  this  enjoyment  then  is  revealed  what  that divine 
risen Light really is  enjoyment is  the mystery of its being  For 
the mystical is  not concealment of a secret  or ignorance  but 
consists in the selfknowing itself to be one with the divine Being 
and that this therefore is revealed Only the self is  manifest to 
itself or what is  manifest is so only in  the immediate certainty 
of itself  But it is  in  this  immediate  certainty  that  the simple 
divine Being has  been placed by the  Oult as  a  thing that can 
be  used  it  not only  has  an existence  that  is  seen  felt  smelt 
tasted  but it is  also  an object ofdesire and by  being actually 
enjoyed  becomes  one with  the  self and  thereby  completely 
revealed  to  the self and  manifest  to  it  That which  is  said  to 
be  manifest  toReason  to  the  heart  is  in  fact  still  secret  for 
it still  lacks  the  actual  certainty of immediate existence  both 
the  certainty  of objectivity  and  the  certainty  belonging  to 
enjoyment a certainty which in religion however is not merely 
immediate and unthinking but is  at the same time purely the 
certainty  that is  known  by the self 

  What has thus  through the  Cult become  manifest to 
selfconscious Spirit within itself is  simple essence as  themove 
ment  partly out of its dark night of concealment up into concid
sciousness there to be its silently nourishing substance butno 
less however the movement of again losing itselfin the nether 
darkness  and  lingering  above  only  with  a  silent  maternal 
yearning  The  moving impulse  is  however  nothing  but  the 
manynamed divine Light of the risen Sun and its undisciplined 
tumultuous life which similarly let go from its merely abstract 
Being  at first  enters into  the  objective  existence  of the  fruit 
and then surrendering itself to self  consciousness  in  it attains 
to genuine realityand now roams about as a crowd offrenzied

females  the  un tamed  revelry  of  Nature  in  selfconscious 
form 

  But what is disclosed to consciousness is  still only absocid

lute Le abstract Spirit which is  this simple essence not Spirit 
as it is in its own self in other words it is  only immediate Spirit 
the Spirit of Nature Consequently its selfconscious life is  only 
the  mystery  of bread  and wine  of Ceres  and of Bacchus  not 
of the other  the  strictly  higher  gods  whose  individuality  incid
cludes as an essential momentselfconsciousness as such Therecid
fore  Spirit has not yet sacrificed itself as  selfconscious  Spirit to 
selfconsciousness and the mystery of bread and wine is not yet 
the  mystery  of flesh  and  blood 

  This  undisciplined revelry of the  god  must bring itself 
to  rest as  an  object  and  the  enthusiasm  which  did  not attain 
to consciousness  must  produce a  work  that confronts it  as  in 
the  previous  case  the  statue  confronts  the  artist  as  a  work 
moreover that is equally complete but not however as  an incid
trinsically lifelessbut as a living self Such a Cult is  the festival 
whih  man  celebrates  in  his  own  honour  though  not  yet 
imparting to  that Cult the significance of the absolute  Being 
for  iris essence  that is  manifest  to  him  at first  not yet Spirit 
notassomething that essentially takes on human form But this 
Cult  lays  the  foundation  for  this  revelation  and  unfolds  its 
moments separately  Thus here we  have  the  ahstract  moment 
of the living corporeality of essence just as previously we had the 
urtity of both in an unconscious revelry  Man thus puts himself 
in the place of the s ta tue as  the shape that has been raised and 
fashioned  for  perfectly free  movement just as  the  statue  is  per 
fecdy free  repose  Although each individual knows how to  play 
the part of at least a  torchbearer one of them comes forward 
who is  the  patterned  movement  the smooth  elaboration  and 
fluentenergyofal the participants He is an inspired and living 
work of art that matchS strength with its  beauty and on him 
is  bestowed as  a  reward for his strength  the decoration with 
which  the statue was  honoured  and  the  honour  of being  in 
place  of the  god  in  stone  the  highest  bodily  representation 
among his  people of their essence 

  In  both  representations  which  have just come  before 
us  there is  present the  unity of selfconsciousness and spiritual 
essence  but  they  are  still  not equally  balanced  against  each

other In the Bacchic enthusiasm it is the self that is beside itself 
but in  corporeal  beauty  it  is  spiritual  essence  The stupor  of 
consciousness and its wild stammering utterance in  the former 
case must be taken up into the clear existence of the latter and 
the  nonspiritual  clarity  of  the  latter  into  the  inwardness  of 
the former  The perfect element in which inwardness is just as 
external  as  externality is  inward  is  once  again  speech  but it 
is  neither the speech of the  Oracle wholly contingent and  incid
dividual as  regards its  content  nor the emotional  hymn sung 
in praise of the individual god nor again is  it the  meaningless 
stammer of Bacchic frenzy  On the  contrary  it  has  gained  a 
lucid and universal content a content that is  lucid  because the 
artist has worked his way out of the initial enthusiasm originatcid
ing wholly from substance into a  definite shape  This shape 
is  his  own  existence which  in all  its  stirrings  and  impulses  is 
permeated  and  accompanied  by selfconscious  soul  and  the 
content is universal for in this festival which honours man there 
vanishes the onesidedness of the statues which  contain  only a 
national Spirit a  specific character of the  divine  nature  The 
handsome warrior is indeed the glory of his  particular nation 
but he is  a  corporeal individuality in which are swallowed  up 
the fulness and seriousness of meaning and the inner character 
of the Spirit which bears the  particular life  the  demands  the 
needs and customs of his nation  In  this kenosis  this externalcid
ization ofitself into complete corporeality Spirit has laid aside 
the special influences and sympathies of Nature which  as  the 
Spirit of the nation it contained shut up within it  Its  nation 
is therefore no longer conscious in this Spirit of its particularity 
but rather of having laid this aside and is conscious of the unicid
versality of its  human existence 

c  The  spiritual  work  of art 

  The national Spirits which  become  conscious  of their 
essence in the shape ofa particular animal coalesce into a single 
Spirit  Thus  it  is  that  the  separate  beautiful  national  Spirits 
unite  into  a  single  pantheon  the  element  and  habitation  of 
which  is  language  The  pure  intuition  of  itself  as  universal 
humanity  has in the actuality of the  national Spirit this form 
the national Spirit combines with the others with which it concid
stitutes through Nature a single nation in a common undertak

c  ce  RELIGION 

ing  and for  this  task forms  a  collective  nation  and  therewith 
a collective Heaven This universaity to which Spirit in its  excid
istence  attains  is  however  only  this  first  universality  which 
first  issues from  the individuality of the ethical sphere  which 
has not yet overcome its immediacy has not yet formed  a single 
State out of its  peoples  The ethical life  of the actual national 
Spirit rests partIy on the immediate trust of the individuals in 
their nation as  a  whole  partIy on  the  direct  share  which  all 
regardless  of  differences  of  class  take  in  the  decisions  and 
actions of the government  In the union which  to begin with 
is  not a  permanent arrangement but only for the purpose  of a 
common action  that freedom of participation by each and all 
isfor the time being  put on one side  This first  alliance is  there  
fore more an assembly ofindividuaHties than their domination 
by an abstract thought which would rob the indjviduals of their 
selfconscious  participation in  the  will  and deed  of the  State 
  The assembly of national Spirits constitutes  a circle  of 
shapes which now embraces the whole of Nature as  we  as  the 
whole ethical world  They stand too  under the supreme com 
mand ofthc one rather than under his sovereignty By themselves 
they  are  the  universal  substances  of  what  the  selfconscious 
essence in itselfis and does This however cons ti tutes the power 
and in the first  instance  the centre at least with which  those 
universal  beings  are  concerned  and  which  at  first  seems  to 
merge their affairs only contingently But it is  the return of the 
divine Being into selfconsciousness  that  already  contains  the 
reason why selfconsciousness forms  the centre for those divine 
powers and conceals their unity to begin with under the form 
of a friendly  external  connection of the  two  worlds 

  The same  universality  which  belongs  to  this  content 
attaches necessarily also  to  the form  of consciousness  in  which 
the content appears  It is  no  longer  the  actual practice of the 
Cult  but  a  practice  that  is  raised  not  yet  indeed  into  the 
Notion  but at first into picturethinking  into the synthetic linkcid
ingtogether  of  selfconscious  and  external  existence  The 
external  existence  of  this  picturethinking  language  is  the 
earliest language the Epic as such which contains the universal 
content of the world universal at least in the sense  of completecid
ness  though  not  indeed  as  the  universality  of  thought  The 
Minstrel is  the individual  and  actual Spirit from  whom  as  a 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM  OF  AR T 

 
subject of this world it the world  is  produced and by whom 
it is  borne His  pathos is  not the stupefying  power of Nature 
but  Mnemosyne  recollection  and  a  gradually  developed  incid
wardness  the  remembrance  of  essence  that  formerly  was 
directly  present  He is  the organ  that vanishes  in  its  content 
what counts is not his own sefbut his Muse his universal song 
What however  is  in fact present is  the syllogism in which  the 
extreme of universality  the  world  of the  gods  is  linked  with 
individuality with the  Minstrel  through  the  middle  term  of 
particularity The middle term is  the nation in its  heroes who 
areindividual men like the Minstrel but presented only in idea 
and are thereby at the same time unzversal like the free extreme 
of universality  the  gods 

  In this  Epic  then  there is  in general presented  to  concid
sciousness what is  implicitly  accomplished in the Cult the relacid
tion of the divine to  the human  The content is  an action  of the 
selfconscious essence The acting disturbs the tranquillity of the 
Substance  and  excites  the  essence  so  that  its  simple  unitary 
nature is  divided  nd  opened  up  into  the  manifold  world  of 
natlral and ethical  powers  The action is  the  violation of the 
peaceful earth  the  trench which  animated by  blood  evokes 
the departed spirits and these thirsting for life receiveit in  the 
action  of selfconsciousness  The business  which  is  the  object 
of these general exertions has twosides  the side of the self  by 
which  the  bysins  is  accomplished  by  a  totality  of  actual 
nations and the individualities standing at their head and  the 
side of the universal  by  which  it is  accomplished  by their subcid
stantil powers Formerly however the relation of the two bore 
the character of a  synthetic  combination of the  universal  and 
theinQlvidual ie of pictrethinking On this specific qharaccid
ter depends thppraisal of this world The relation of the two 
is  thus  a  mingling  of them  which  inconsistently  divides  and 
apportions th unity of the action and superfluously throws the 
action over from  one side  to  the other  The  universal  powers 
have the form of individuality and hence the principle of action 
in them w hat they effec t appears therefore to proceed en tirely 
from  them  and  to  be  as  free  an  action  as  that  of men  Concid
sequently  both  gods  and  men  have  done  one  and  the  same 
thing  The  earnestness  of those  divine  powers  is  a  ridiculous 
superfluity since  they are in fact  the  power or strength of the 

c  ce  RELIGION 

individuality  performing  the  action  while  the  exertions  and 
la bour of the latter is  an equally useless  effort since it is  rather 
the gods who manage everything  Ephemeral mortas who are 
as nothing are at the same time the mighty self that brings into 
subjection  the  universal  Beings  offends  the  gods  and  in 
general procures for  them an actual existence and  an interest 
in acting  Just as  conversely  these  impotent  universal  Beings 
who nourish  themselves on the gifts of men and through  them 
alone get something to do  are  the  natural substance  and  the 
material of all  events  and  are  equally the ethical matter and 
the  pathos  of  action  If  their  elemental  natures  are  first 
brought into actual existence  and  into  an  active  relationship 
by the free  self of individuality  they  are no less  the  universal 
that  withdraws  itself from  this  connection  that  remains  uncid
restricted  in  its  own  specific  character  and  through  the  incid
vincible elasticity of its  unity effaces  the atomistic singleness of 
the doer and his constructions  preserves itselfin its  purity and 
dissolves  everything individ ualin its fluid  nature 

 I    Just as the gods fall  into a con tradictoryrelation with 
the selfJike  nature  opposed  to  them so  too their  universality 
comes  into conflict with  their  own  specific  character  and  its 
relationship  to others They are  the eternal  beautiful  indivicid
duals who serenein theirown existence are exempt from transcid
itoriness and the influence of alien powers But they are at the 
sametime specific elements particular gods which therefore stand 
in relation to others But that relation to others which in virtue 
of the opposition involved in it is a conflict with them is a comicid
cal selfforgetfulness  of their eternal  nature  Determinateness 
is  rooted in their divine existence and possesses  in its limitation 
the independence of the whole individuality through this their 
characters at once lose  the sharpness of their  peculiar disposicid
tion and blend together in their ambiguity One purpose of the 
activityand  their activity  itsefsince it is  directed  against 
an other and hence against an invincible divine power is  an 
arbitraryshowingoffwhich at once melts away and transforms 
the apparent earnestness of the action into a harmless selfton  
fident  play  without  result  or  outcome  If  however  in  the 
nature  of their  divinity  the  negative  element  or  the  specific 
determinateness of that nature appears merely as  the inconsiscid
tency of their activity and as the contradiction between purpose 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF  ART 

 
and result  and if that independent assurance  retains  the  pre 
ponderance over the element of determinateness then by  that 
very fact the pure power of the negative confronts it and morecid
over  as  the  ultimate  power over  it  and  against  which  it can 
do  nothing  They  are  the  universal  and  the  positive  over 
against  the  individual  self of mortals  which  cannot  hold  out 
against  their  might  but  the  universal  self  for  that  reason 
hovers over them and over this whole world of picturethinking 
to  which  the entire content belongs  as  the  irrational  void  of 
Necessitya mere happening which  they  must face  as  beings 
without a self and sorrowfully for these determinate natures cancid
not find  themselves  in this  purity 

  This Necessity however is the unity of the Notion which 
brings under control the contradictory substantial being of the 
separate moments a unity in which the inconsistency and arbicid
trariness of their action is orderly disposed and the play of their 
actions receives its earnestness and worth in the  actions  themcid
selves   The contentof the world of pictorial thought freely  uncid
foldsitselfin the middle term on i own account gathering itseJf 
rOllnd the individ uality of a hero who however in his strength 
and  beauty  feels  his  life  is  broken  and  sorrowfully  awaits  an 
early death  For the individuality thJt  is  in itself firmly  estabcid
lished and actual is  banished  to  its  etreme  and  split  into  its 
moments whicp have not yet found and united thernelves The 
one 
is 
Necessity  which shares  in  the life  of the  middle  term just as 
little as does  the other the actUq individual  the  Minstrel who 
keeps himself outside of it and is  lost in his  performance  Both 
extremes  must  draw  nearer  to  the  content  one  of  them 
Neqessity  has  to fill itself with the content  the other  the lancid
guage of the  Minstrel must participJte  in  it and  the  content 
formerly left to itself must receive  within it the  certainty and 
the  fied character of the  negative 

the  abstract  nonactual  one

  This  higher language  that of Tragedy gathers  closer 
together the dispersed momen ts of the inner essential world and 
the world of action  the substance of the divine in accordance 
with the nature of the Notion sunders itself into its shapes and 
their movement is  likewise  in conformity with  the Notion  In 
regtrd  to form  the language ceases  to  be  narrative because it 
enters into the contentjust as  the content ceases tobe one that 

 

C  C C   R E L J G ION 

is imaginatively presented The hero is himself the speaker and 
the performance displays to the audiencewho are also specta  
torsself  conscious human beings whoknow their rights and purcid
poses the power and the will of their specific nature and know 
how  to  assert  them  They are artists  who  do not express  with 
unconscious naturalness and naivety the external aspect of their 
resolves  and  enterprises  as  happens  in  the  language  accomcid
panying ordinary actions  in  actuallife  on  the contrary  they 
give utterance to  the inner essence they prove the rightness of 
their  action  and  the  pathos  which  moves  them  is  soberly 
asserted and definitely expressed in its  universal individuality 
free  from  the  accidents of circumstance  and personal idiosyn  
crasies  Lastly  these  characters  exist  as  actual  human  beings 
who impersonate the heroes and portray them not in the form 
ofanarrativc but in the actual speech of the actors themselves 
Just as  it is  essential  for  the statue  to  be  the  work  of human 
hands so is  the actor essential to his  masknot as  an external 
condition from which artistically considered we  must abstract 
orsofar as  we do have to make abstraction from  it we admit 
justthis that Art does not yet contain in it the true and proper 
self 

  The  general  ground  on  which  the  movement  of these 

shapes produced from the Notion takes  place is  the consciouscid
ness  expressed  in  the  first  imaginative  language  that  of the 
Epic  where  the content devoid of a  sdfis  left  disunited  It 
is the commonalty as such whose wisdom finds utterance in the 
Chorus of the  Elders  in  the  powerlessness  of this  chorus  the 
commonaltyhas its representative because the common people 
themselves constitute merely the positive and passive  material 
of the individuality of the governfnent confronting it  Lacking 
the power of the negative it is  unable to  hold  together and  to 
subdue the riches and varied abundance of the divine life  but 
lets it all go its own separate ways and in its  reverential hymns 
it extols each individual moment as  an  independent goq first 
one and then another But where it does  detect the earnestness 
of the  Notion  in  its  onward  march  dashing  these  figures  to 
pieces and comes to see how ill it fares  with its venerated gods 
who dare to  trespass on ground where  the  Notion holds sway 
then it is not itself the negative power which actively interferes 
on the contrary it clings to  the selfless  thought of such power 

RELIGION  IN  THE  FORM OF  ART 

 
clings  to  the  consciousness  of an  alien  fate  and  produces  the 
empty desire for  ease and comfort and feeble  talk  of appease M 
ment In its fear of the higher powers which are the immediate 
instruments of the Substance fearful  of their struggles  among 
themselves  and fearful  of the  simple  self of Necessity  which 
crushes  them as  well as  the living beings  linked with  them in 
its  compassion  for  these  living  beings  which  it  also  knows  to 
be the same as itselfit is  conscious only of a  paralysing terror 
of this  movement  of equally  helpless  pity  and  as  the  end  of 
it all the empty repose of submission  to Necessity whose work 
is  understood neither as  the  necessary  deed  of the  character 
nor as  the  action of the  absolute Being within  itself 

  At  the  level  of  this  spectatorMconsciousness 

the 
Chorus  the  indifferent  ground  on  which  the  performance 
takes place Spirit does not appear in its scattered multiplicity 
but in the simple diremptiqn of the Notion Its Substance thereM 
fore  shows  itself torn  asunder  merely  into  its  two  extreme 
powers These elementary universal beings are at the same time 
selfconscious individualitiesheroes who place their consciouscid
ness  into  one  of thse powers  find  in  it  determinateness  of 
character and constitute the effective activity and actuality of 
these  powers  This  universal  individuation  descends  again 
as  will  be  remembered  to  the  immediate  reality  of existence 
and  presents  itself to  a  crowd  of spectators  who  have  in  the 
Chorus their counterpart or rather their own thought express  
ingitself  

  The  content  and  movement  of Spirit  which  here  is 
object to  itself has  already been considered as  the nature and 
realization of the ethical substance  In its  religion it attains to 
a consciousness of itself or exhibits itself to consciousness in its 
purer form  and its  simpler embodiment  If  then  the  ethical 
substance in virtue of its Notion split itselfas regards its content 
into powers which were defined  as  divine and  human law or 
law of the nether and of the  upper worldthe one the Family 
the other the State power the first  being the feminine and  the 
second the masculine charactersimilarly now the previously 
multiform circle of gods with its fluctuating characteristics concid
fines  itself to  these  powers which are thereby brought closer to 
genuine individuality For the previous dispersion of the whole 
into manifold and abstract forces  which appear hypostatized 

C  CC  RELIGION 

is  the dissolution of the Subject which comprehends them only 
as  moments  within  its  self  so  that  individuality  is  merely  the 
superficial  form  of these  entities  Conversely  a  further  discid
tinction of characters than that just named is  to  be attributed 
to  contingent and  intrinsically external  personality 

  At the same time the ethical substance is divided with 
respect to its form  or to knowing  Spirit when acting appears  qua 
consciousness  over  against  the object  to  which  its  activity  is 
directed and which consequently is  determined as  the negative 
of the knower the doer finds  himself thereby in  the antithesis 
of knowing  and  notknowing  He  takes  his  purpose from  his 
character and knows it as an ethical essentiality  but on account 
of the  determinateness of his  character he  knows  only  the  one 
power ofsubstance the other remaining for him concealed The 
present reality is therefore one thing in itself and another thing 
for consciousness the upper and the nether law come to signify 
in  this  connection  the  power  that  knows  and  reveals  itself to 
consciousness  and  the  power  that  conceals  itself and  lies  in 
ambush The one is  the aspect of Light the god of the Oracle 
who in accordance with its natural moment has sprung from 
the all  illuminating Sun knows all and reveals  allPhoebus 
and  Zeus who is  his  father  But the  commands  of this  truthcid
speaking god and his announcements of what is  are really decid
ceptive For this knowing is in its principle immediately a notcid
knowing  because  consciousness  in  its  action  is  in its  own  self 
this  antithesis  He  who  was  able  to  unlock  the  riddle  of the 
Sphinx  and  he  who trusted  with  childlike  confidence  are 
therefore  both  sent  to  destruction  through  what  the  god 
revealed  to  them  This  priestess  through  whom  the  beautiful 
god speaks is in no way differentfronl the equivocating sisters 
of Fa te  who by their promises drive to crime those who lis ten 
to  them and who by the doubletongued  character of what 
they announced as  a  certainty deceive him  who relied on  the 
obvious  meaning  The consciousness  therefore  that is  purer 
than  the latter  which believes  witches  and is  more  prudent

more solid and thorough than the former which trusts the pries 
tess and the beautiful god tarries with his revenge even though 
the very spirit of his father reveals  to him the  crime by which 
he  was  murdered  and  institutes  still  other  proofsfor the 
reason  that this  revelatory spirit could also  be  the  devil 

  The grounds of this mistrust are that the knowing concid

sciousness is caught up in the antithesis of the certainty of itself 
and objective essence Ethical rightness which holds that what 
actually is  is  in  itself nothing  when  opposed  to  absolute  law 
learns  that its  knowing  is  onesided  its  law  only  a  law  of its 
own character and that it has seized on only one of the powers 
of the substance  The action itself is  this inversion of the known 
into its opposite into being  is  the changinground of the rightcid
ness  based on character and knowing into  the  rightness of the 
very opposite with which the former js bound up in the essential 
nature of the Substanceconverts it into the Furies Erinnyes 
who embody the other power and character aroused hito hos  
tHity  This nether right sits with Zeus on  the  throne and enjoys 
equal honour withthe god who is  revealed and known 
    To  these  three  beings  the  world  of the  gods  of  the 
Chorus is  restricted by the acting individuality  One of them 
is  the Substance the power presiding over the hearth and  the 
spiri tof family piety as well as the universal power of state and 
government Since this  distinction belongs  to  the substance as 
Such  when it is  pictorially represented it is  not individualized 
in two distinct figures  but has in actuality the  two  persons  of 
its  characters  On  the  other  hand  the  distinction  between 
knowing  and  notknowing  falls  within  each  of the  selfcon  
sciousnessesand only in  abstraction  in  the  element of unicid
versality is  it divided into  two  individual shapes  For  the self 
of the hero has an existence only as  a  whole consciousness and 
is  therefore essentially the whole of the distinction belonging to 
the  form  but its  substance  is  determinate  and  only  one  side 
of the distinguished content belongs to him Therefore the  two 
sides  of consciousness  which have in actuality no separate incid
dividuality peculiar to each receive when pictorially represented 
each its  own  particular shape  the one  that of the  revelatory 
god  the  other  that of the  Furies  who  keep  themselves  concid
cealed  In part both enjoy equal honour but again  the shape 
assumed  by  the  substance  Zeus  is  the  necessity  of the  relation 

 

C  CC  RELIGION 

of the two  to each other The substance is  the relation a  that 
the knowing ifor itself  but has its  truth in what is  simple  b 
that the distinction through and in which actual consciousness 
exists has its basis in that inner being which destroys it c  that 
the clear conscious assurance  of certainty  has  its  confirmation in 
forgeifulness 

  Consciousness disclosed this antithesis through action 
acting in accordance with the knowledge revealed it finds  out 
that  that  knowledge  is  deceptive  and  being  committed  as 
regards the content of that knowledge  to one of the attributes 
of substance  it violated the other and so  gave  it  the  right  as 
against itself In following the god that knows it really got hold 
of what was  not revealed  and  pays  the  penalty  of trusting  a 
know ledge w hose ambiguity  for such is its na ture also becomes 
explicitfor consciousness  and a  warning to  i  The  ravings of 
the  priestess  the inhuman shape of the witches  the  voices  of 
trees arid birds dreams and so forth are not the ways in which 
truth manifests  itself  they are warning signs  of deception  of 
an absence ofsef  possession of the singularity and contingency 
of the knowing  Or in other words the opposite power which 
is violated by consciousness is  presentas express law and valid 
right whether law of the  family or of the state  consciousness 
on the other hand fonowed its own way of knowing and con 
cealed from  itself what was  openly revealed  The truth  how  
ever of the opposing powers of the con ten t  or the know ledge 
and of consciousness is  the  result  that both  are  equally right 
and  therefore  in  their  antithesis  which  is  brought  about  by 
action  are  equally  wrong  The  action  in  being  carried  out 
demonstrates their unity in the natural downfall of both powers 
and  both  selfconscious characters  The  reconciliation  of the 
opposition with hself is  the Lethe of the underworld in death 
or the  Lethe of the  upper world as  absolution not from  guilt 
for consciousness cannot deny its  guilt  because it committed 
the act  but from the crime and also the peaceofmindfoHow  
ing atonement for the crime  Both are oblivion  the vanishedcid

men t and the eq ual honour and consequent ind ifferen t unreality 
of Apollo and  the Furies  and  the  return of their spiritual life 
and activity into  the  unitary heing of Zeus 

  This  Fate  completes  the  depopulation  of Heaven  of 
that unthinking mingling of individuality and essencea ming 
ling  whereby  the  action  of essence  appears  as  inconsequent 
arbitrary  unworthy  of itself  for  individuality  that  is  only 
superficially attached  to  essence  is  unessential  The expulsion 
of such  shadowy  insubstantial  picturethoughts  which  was 
demanded by the philosophers ofantiquity thus already begins 
in Greek Tragedy in general through the fact that the division 
of the substance is  controlled by the Notion and consequently 
individ uality is  essen tial individ uali ty  and the determina tions 
are  ahsolute  characters  The selfconsciousness  that  is  reprecid
sented in Tragedy  knows  and  acknowledges  therefore  only 
one supreme power and this Zeus only as the power of the state 
or of the  hearth  and  in  the  antithesis  belonging  to  knowing 
of knower and known oulyas the father of the particular that 
is  takiqgshape in tbeknowing and  also as the Zeus of the oath 
and of the  Furies  the  Zeus  of the universal  of the inner being

Notion and dispersed throughout the pictorial representation 
moments which the Chorus allows  to  hold sway one after the 
otherare on the other hand not the pathos of the hero they 
sink to theleve of passions in the hero to the level of contingent 
insubstantial  moments  which  though  praised  by  the  impercid
sonal Cborus are not capable of constituting the  character of 
the heroes nor of being epressed and honoured as  their essencid
tial  nature 

   But also  the  persons of the  divine  Being itself  as  well 
as  the  character  of its  substance  coalesce  into  the  simplicity 
of what is without consciousness   This Necessity has in contrast 
to  selfconsciousness  the  characteristic  of being  the  negative 
power of all  the shapes that appear a  power in which  they do 
not recognize themselves but on the contrary perish  The self 
appears merely as assigned to the characters not as the mediating 
factor of the movement But selfconsciousness  the simple cercid
tainty  of self  is  in fact  the  negative  power  the  unity  of Zeus 
of substantial  being and of abstract  Necessity  it is  the  spiritual

unity into which everything returns  Because  actual  selfconcid
sciousness is  still distinguished from the substance and  Fate  it 
is  partly the Chorus or rather the crowd of spectators  whom 
this  movement of the divine life  fills  with fear  as  being somecid
thing alien or in whom  this  movement  as  something close  to 
them  produces  merely  the  emotion  of  passive  sympathy 
Partly  too so  far as  consciousness is  involved  and belongs  to 
the  characters  this  union  is  an  external  one  is  a  hypocrisy 
because  the  true  union  that of the  self  Fate  and  substance 
is  not yet present  The hero who appears  before  the onlookers 
splits  up into  his  mask  and  the  actor  into  the  person  in  the 
play and  the actual self 

  The selfconsciousness of the hero must step forth from 
his mask and present itself as knowing itself to be the fate both 
of the gods of the chorus and of the absolute powers themselves 
and as beingno longer separated from the chorus from the unicid
versal  consciousness 

  Comedy has therefore above all  the aspect that actual 
selfconsciousness exhibits itself as  the fate  of the  gods  These 
elementary Beings arc as universal moments not a self and are 
notequal They arc itis true endowed with the form ofindivi  
duality but this is only in imagination and does not really and 
truly  belong  to  them  the  actuaL self does  not  have  such  an 
abstractmomentforits substance and content It the Subject is 
raised above such a moment such a single property and clothed 
in th mask it proclaims the irony of such a property wanting to 
be something on its own account The pretensions of universal 
essentiality  are  uncovered  in  the  self  it shows  itself  to  be 
entangled  in  an  actual  existence  and  drops  the  mask  just 
because it wants to be something genuine The self appearing 
here in its significance as something actual plays with the mask 
which it once put on in order to act its  part  but it as  quitkly 
breaks out again from  this  illusory  character and stands forth 
in its own nakedness and ordinariness which it shows to  he not 
distinct from  the genuine self  the actor or from  the spectator 
  This general dissolution of the shapes of the essentiality 
as  a  whole  in  their individuality  becomes  in  its  con ten tmore 
petulant and bitter in so far as  the content has its mOre serious 
and  necessary  meaning  The  divine  substance  unites  within 
itself the meaning of natural and ethical essentiality As regards

the natural element actual selfconsciDusness shows in the very 
fact  of employing  things  Df Nature  for  its  adDrnment  fDr  its 
dwelling and also in feasting on its sacrificial offering  that it 
is  itself the Fate  to  which  the secret is  revealed viz  the  truth 
abDut the essential independence of Nature  In the  mystery Df 
bread and wine it appropriates this independence along with 
the meaning of the inner essence and in Comedy it is cDnscious 
of the irony of this  meaning generally  NDw  in so  far  as  this 
meaning contains ethical essentiality it is  partly the  nation in 
its  two aspects of the state or Demos  proper and the individucid

the general  mass  which knDws  itself as  lord  and ruJer  and is

of its  actual  existence  and  exhibits  the  ludicrous  contrast 
between its own Dpinion  Df itself and its  immediate existence 
between its  necessity  and cDntingency  its  universality and its 
CDmmDnness  If the  principle  of its  individuality  separated 
from the universal makes itself conspicuous in the proper shape 
Df an actual existence  and openly  usurps  and administers  the 
commDnwealth  to which it is  a  secret detriment  then  there is 
expDsed mDre immediately the  contrast between the  universa 
as  a  theory  and  that with which  practice is  concerned  there 
is  exposed  the  cDmplete  eJTlancipatiDn  of the  purpDses  of the

  RatiDnal thinking frees the divine Being from its cDntincid

Chorus which produces  all  sorts  Df ethical  maxims  and  gives 
currency  to  a  hDSt  of laws  and  specific  cDncepts  of duty  and 
of right lifts  these  into  the simple  Ideas  of the  Beautiful  and

of the dialectic contained in these maxims and laws themselves 
and  consequently  the  consciDusness  of the  vanishing  Df  the 
absolute  validity  previously  attaching  to  them  With  the 
vanishing of the contingent character and superficial individucid
ality which  imagination  lent  to  the  divine  Beings  all  that is 
left to them as regards their natural aspect is  the bareness of their

C  CC  RELIGION 

those imaginative representations  The essence of these having 
been  given  the  form  of thought  they  have  become  the  simple 
thoughts of the Beautiful and  the  Good  which  tolerate  being 
filled  with any kind  of content  The power of dialectic  knowcid
ledge  puts  specific  laws  and  maxims  of conduct at  the  mercy 
of the pleasure and frivolity of youth which is  led astray  by it 
and provides weapons for deceiving old  age with its  fears  and 
apprehensions and which is  restricted  to  life  in  its  individual 
aspect  The pure thoughts of the Beautiful and  the  Good  thus 
display  a  comic  spectacle  through  their  liberation  from  the 
opinion which contains  both  their specific  determinateness  as 
content  and  also  their  absolute  determinateness  liberation 
tha t is from the firm hold of consciousness on these  determinacid
tenesses they become empty and just for  that reason  the sport 
of mere opinion and  the  caprice of any chance  individuality 
  Therefore the  Fate which  up  to  this  point has  lacked 
consciousness and consists in an empty repose and oblivion and 
is separated from selfconsciousness this Fate is now united with 
selfconsciousness  The  individual  self is  the  negative  power

pletely returned in to itself Through the fact that it is the indivicid
dual consciousness in  the certainty of itself that exhibits  itself 
as this absolute power this latter has lost the form ofsomething 
presented to  consciousness  something altogether separate from  concid
sciousness and alien to  it as  were the statue and also  the living 
beautiful corporeality or the content of the Epic and the powers 
and persons  of Tragedy  This  unity  too snot the  unconscious 
unity of the Cult and the mysteries on the contrary the actual 
self of the actor coincides  with  what  he  impersonates just as 
the spectator is  completely at  home  in  the  drama  performed 
before  him  and sees  himself playing in  it  What  this  selfconcid
sciousness beholds is  that whatever assumes the form ofessenticid
ality over against it is  instead  dissolved  in  itin its  thinking 
its existence and its actionand is at its mercy It is  the return 
of every thing universal into the certainty of itself which in COll

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
sequence is  this complete loss  offear and of essential being on 
the  part  of all  that  is  alien  This  selfcertainty  is  a  state  of 
spiritual wellbeing and of repose  therein  such as  is  not to  be 
found  anywhere  outside of this  Comedy 

C  THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

  Through the religion of Art Spirit has advanced from 
the form of Substance  to  assume  that of Subject  for  it produces  its 
outer  shape  thus  making  explicit  in  it  the  act  or  the  selfcid
consciousness that merely vanishes in the awful Substance and 
does  not apprehend its  own self in  its  trust  This  incarnation 
of the divine Being starts from  the statue which wears only the 
outer shape of the Self  the inwardness  the SeWs  activity falling 
outside of it  But in  the  Cult the  two  sides  have  become one 
and in the outcome of he religion of Art this  unity  in its  concid
summation has  even gone  right over at the same  time  to  the 
extreme of the Self  In Spirit that is  completely certain of itself 
in  the  individuality  of consciousness  all  essentiality  is  subcid
merged  The proposition  that expresses  this levity runs  The 
Selfis absolute Being  The essence  the  Substance for  which 
the Self was only Jan accident has sunktothe level of a  predicid
cate  and  in  this  selfconsciausness  over  against  which  there  is 
nothing in  the form  of essence  Spirit has  lost  its  consciousness 
  This proposition  The Self is  absolute Being  belongs 
quite obviously to the nonreligious actual or secular  Spirit 
and we have to remember which shape of that Spirit itis which 
expresses  it  It will  contain the movement  and  also  the  concid
version of it which degrades the Self to the level of a  predicate 
and elevates  Substance  to  Subject  and  in  this  manner  that 
the converse  proposition does  not in  itself or JOT  US  make  Subcid
stance into Subject or  to  put the same thing another way  it 
does not reinstate Substance inuch a manner that Spirits concid
sciousness is  led  hack  to  its  beginning  to  natural religion  on 
thv  contrary  this  conversion is  one  that is  brought  about for 
and by selfconsciousness itself Since selfconsciousness surrenders 
its  alienation  and 
itself  consciously 
remains  the  Subject of substance  but since  it is  likewise  self 
alienated  it still  has  the  consciousness  of the  substance  or 
since  selfconsciousness  through  its  sacrifice  brings  forth  suh

it  is  preserved 

in 

C  CC  RELIGION 


stance  as  Subject  the  substance  remains  selfconsciousnesss 
own  Self  In  the  first  of the  two  alternative  propositions  the 
substantiality of the Subject merely vanishes and in the second 
Substance is  only a  predicate and both sides  are  thus  present 
in each with contrary ineq uality of value  Here  however  the 
result achieved is  the union and permeation of the  two natures 
in which both  are  with equal  value  essential  and  at  the  same 
time only moments  so  that Spirit is  simultaneously consciousness 
ofi tself as its objective substance and simple selfconsciousness comcid
muning with itself 

  The religion of Art belongs to the ethical Spirit which 
we  earlier saw perish  in  the condition  of right  or law  ie  in  the 
proposition  The Self as such the abstract person is  absol ute 
Being  In the  ethical life  the Self is  submerged  in  the  Spirit 
ofits people it is the universality that isfilled Butsimple individucid
ality raises itself out of this content and its levity refines it into 
a person into the abstract universality of rightor law  In this 
the reality of the ethical Spirit islost and having lost all content 
the  Spirits  of national  individuals  are  gathered  into  a  single 
pantheon notinto a pantheon of picturethought whose powercid
less form lets each Spiritgo its own way but into the pantheon 
of abstract  universality  of pure  thought  which  disembodies 
themandimparts to the spidtless Self to the individual person 
a  being that is  in and for  itself 

 I  But this Self has through its emptiness let the content 
go  free  it is  only within itself that consciousness  is  essence  its 
own existence  the legal recognition of the  person is  the unfilled 
abstraction  What  it  possesses  therefore  is  rather  only  the 
thought oLitself  or in  other words  in  the  mode  in  which  it 
immediately exists  and  knows  itself as  object  it is  something 
that  is  not  actual  Hence it is  only  the  Stoic  independence  of 
thought  which  passes  through  the  dialectic  of the  Sceptical 
consciousness  to  find  its  truth  in  that  shape  which  we  have 
called the Unhappy Selfconsciousness  

  This selfconsciousness  knows  what  the validity of the 
abstract  person  amounts  to  in  reality  and  equally  in  pure 
thought  I t knows  that such validity is  rather a  complete loss 
it is  itself this  conscious  loss  of itself and  the  alienation of its 
knowledge about itself  We see  that this  Unhappy Conscious  
ness  constitutes  the  counterpart  and  the  completion  of the 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
comic consciousness  that is  perfectly happy within itself  Into 
the latter all divine being returns or it is  the  complete alienacid
tion  of substance  The  Unhappy  Consciousness  on  the  other 
hand is  conversely  the tragic fate of the certainty of self that 
aims to be absolute  It is  the consciousness of the loss of all essencid
tial  being in  this  certainty  of itself  and  of the  loss  even  of this 
knowledge about itselfthe loss  of substance as  well  as  of the 
Self it is the grief which expresses itself in the  hard saying that 
God is  dead 

  In the condition of right or law then the ethical world 
and  the  religion  of that world are submerged  and  lost  in  the 
comic  consciousness  and  the  Unhappy  Consciousness  is  the 
knowledge of this total loss It has lost both the worth it attached 
to its immediate personality and the worth attached to its  percid
sonality as  mediated as thought  Trust in the eternal laws of the 
gods has vanished and the Oracles which pronounced on par 
ticular questions  are  dumb  The statues are now  only stones 
from  which  the  livillg  soul  has  flown  just  as  the  hymns  are 
words from which belief has gone  The tables of the gods  procid
vide no spirituaLfood and drink and in his games and festivals

constituted  their substance  not  the climate which gave them

gives  not the  spring  and  summer of the  ethical  life  in  which 
they  blossomed and ripened  but  only  the  veiled  recollection 
of that actual world Our active enjoyment of them is  therefore 
not an act of divine worship  through which our consciousness

in  the  gleam  of her selfconscious  eye  and  in  the  gesture  with 
which she offers them so too the Spirit of the Fate that presents 
us  with  those works of art is  more than the ethical life  and the 
actual world of that nation for it is  the inwardizing in us  of the 
Spirit which in them was  still  only  outwardly  manifested  it 
is  the Spirit of the tragic  Fate which gathers all  those  indivicid

whose  existence does  not go  olltside of the  Self  but is  purely

consciousness  in its  inspiration  and  as  a  mediated  unity  in  the

man birthpang of its  emergencethe simplicity  of the  pure 
Notion which contains  those  forms  as  its  moments 

  Spirit has in it the two sides which are presented above 
as  two  converse  propositions  one  is  this  that  substance 
alienates  itself from  itself and  becomes  selfconsciousness  the 
other is the converse that selfconsciousness alienates itself from 
itself and gives  itself the nature  of a  Thing  or  makes  itself a 
universal  Self  Both sides  have  in  this  way  encountered  each 
other  and  through  this  encounter  their  true  union  has  come 
into  being  The  externalization  or  kenosis  of substance  its 
growth into selfconsciousness expresses the transition into the 
opposite the unconscious transition of necessity in other words 
that  substance  is  in  itself selfconsciousness  Conversely  the 
externalization of sefconsciousness  expresses  this  that it is  in 
itselJ the universal essence orsince the Self is  pure beingforcid
self which in its opposite communes with itselfthat it is just 
because  substance  is  selfconsciousness Jor  the  Self  that  it  is 
Spirit  Of this  Spirit  which has  abandoned  the  form  of Subcid
stance  and  enters existence in  the shape  of selfconsciousness 
it may therefore be saidifwe wish to employ relationships decid
rived from naturalgenerationthat it has an actual mother but 
an implicit father  For actuality or selfconsciousness  and the incid
itselfassubstance are its two moments through whose reciprocal 
externalization each becoming the other Spirit comes into excid
istence  as  this  their  unity 

  In so  far  as  selfconsciousness  onesidedly  grasps  only 
its own externalization then even though its object is  for it just 
as much Being as Self and it knows all existence to be spiritual 
in nature nevertheless  true  Spirit has still  not yet come  to  be 
explicitly for selfconsciousness  inasmuch  as  being in general 
or Substance has not equally on its side implicitly externalized 
itself and hecome sefconsciousness  For in that case  then  all 
existence  is  spiritual  being only  from  the  stanQpoint  of concid
sciousness not in its own self Spirit is  in this way only imagined 
into existence  tbis imagining is  the visionary dreaming which 
insinuatesinto both Nature and history into the world and into 
the mythical ideas of earlier religions another esoteric  meancid
ing than that which lies on the surface and in the case of relicid
gions  another meaning  than  the  one  known  in  them  by  the 
selfconsciousness whose religions they were  But  this  meaning 

C  CC  RELIGION 

 
is  one  that is  borrowed  a  garment which  does  not  cover  the 
nakedness  of  the  appearance  and  merits  neither  belief  nor 
reverence it is  no more  than  the  dark night and selfNdelusive 
rapture of consciousness 

  If  therefore  this  meaning of the objective is  not  to  be 
mere imagination it must possess intrinsic being  must originally 
appear in consciousness as stemming from the Notion and must 
come forth  in its  necessity  It is  thus  that  selfknowing  Spirit 
has arisen for us viz through the cognition of the immediate concid
sciousness or of the consciousness of the object in its  immediacy 
through its necessary movement This Notion which as imme 
diate  had also  the  shape  of immediacy  for  its  consciousness 
has  in the second place given itself the shape of implicit self  
consciousness  ie  by just the  same necessity of the  Notion  by 
which being or the immediacy  which is  the contentless object of 
sensuous consciousness  externalizes  itself and becomes  the  I 
for consciousness But the immediate initself or the necessity that 
simply is  is  itself different from  the initself that thinks  or from 
the  cognition  of necessitya  difference  however  which  at  the 
same time does not He outside of the Notion for  the simple unity 
of the  Notion is  immediate  being  itself  The Notion is  at once  a 
selfexternalization  or  a  comingtobe  of  intuitively  perceived 
necessity  and also inthis necessity is in  communion with itself 
knows it and comprehends it  The immediate initself of Spirit 
that gives  itself the shape  of selfconsciousness  means  nothing 
else than that the actual WorldSpirit has attained to this knowcid
ledge ofitself it is then too that this knowledge also first enters 
its  consciousness How that came about we  have already seen 
  That absolute Spirit has given itself implicitly  the shape 
of selfconsciousness and therefore has also given it for its  concid
sciousnessthis now appears as  the beliefojthe world that Spirit 
is  immediately present as  a  selfconscious  Being  ie  as  an  actual 
man  that the believer s immediately certain of Spirit seesjeeis 
and hears this divinity Thus this selfconsciousness is not imagicid
nation but is  actual  in  the  believer  Consciousness  then  does 
not start from its inner life from thought and unite within  itself 
the  thought of God  with  existence  on  the  contrary  it starts 
from  an existence  that is  immediately  present and  recognizes 
God  therein  The  moment of immediate  being  is  present  in  the 
content of the Notion  in such  a  way that  the  religious  Spirit 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
in the return of all essentiality into consciousness  has  become 
a simple positive Selfjust as the actual Spirit as such in the  Uncid
happy  Consciousness  was just this  simple  selfconscious  negacid
tivity  The Self of existent Spirit has  as  a  result  the  form  of 
complete immediacy it is posited neither as something thought 
or imagined  nor  as  something  produced  as  is  the  case  with 
the immediate Self in natural religion and also in  the religion 
of Art  on  the  contrary  this  God  is  sensuously  and  directly 
beheld as  a  Self  as  an actual  individual  man  only  so  is  this 
God selfconsciousness 

  This incarnation of the  divine  Being  or  the fact  that 
it essentially and  directly  has  the  shape  of selfconsciousness 
is  the simple  content of the absolute  religion  In  this  religion 
the divine Being is  known as  Spirit or this  religion  is  the  concid
sciousness of the divine Being that it is  Spirit  For Spirit is  the 
know ledge of oneself in the externaliza tion of oneself the being 
that is  the  movement of retaining its  selfidentity  in  its  othercid
ness  This however is  Substance in so  far  as  Substance is  in 
its  accidents  at  the  same  time  reflected  into  itself  not  incid
different to thern as to something unessential or present in them 
as  in an alien element but in them it is  within itself  Ie  in so 
far  as  it is  Subject or Self  Consequently  in  this  religion  the 
divine  Being  is  revealed  Its  being  revealed  obviously  consists 
in  this  that what it is  is  known  But it is  known  precisely  in 
its  being known  as  Spirit  as  a  Being  that is  essentially  a  selfcid
conscious Being  For there is  something hidden from consciousness 
ioits object if the object is  for  consciousness an other  or somecid
thing alien  and if it does  not know it as  its  own  self  This  concid
cealment ceases when the absolute Being qua Spirit is the object 
of consciousness for  then the object  has  the form  of Self in  its 
relation to consciousness ie  consciousness knows itself immecid
diately in the object or is  manifest to itslf in the object  Con 
sciousness is manifest to itself only in its  own certainty of itself 
its object now is  the Self  but the  Self is  nothing alien  on the 
CQntrary it is the indissoluble unity with itself the universal that 
is  immediately such  It is  the  pure  Notion  pure  Thought  or 
beingforselfwhich is immediately being and consequently being
foran other and as this beingforan other is immediately returned 
into  itself and in communion with  itself  it  is  therefore  that 
which  is  truly  and alone  revealed  The Good  the  Righteous 

c  ce  RELIGION 

the Holy Creator of Heaven and Earth and so  on are predi u 
cates  of a  Subject universal  moments which  have  their supcid
port on this  point and  only  are  when  consciousness  withdraws 
into thought As  long as  it is  they  that are known  their ground 
and essence the Subject itselfis not yet revealed and similarly 
the determinations of the universal are not this  universal itself The 
Subject itself and consequently this pure universal too is howcid
ever  revealed as  Self  for  this  is just this inner being which is 
reflected into itselfand which is immediatey present and is  the 
selfcertainty of the Self for  which it is  present  Thisto be  in 
accordance with its  Notion  that which is  revealedthis is then 
the true shape of Spirit and this its shape the Notion is likewise 
alone its essence and its substance  Spirit is  known  as  selfconcid
sciousness  and  to  this  selfconsciousness  it  is  immediately 
revealed for  Spirit is  this  selfconsciousness  itsef  The  divine 
nature is  the  same  as  the  human  and  it is  this  unity  that  is 
beheld 

  Here  therefore  consciousnessor the  mode in  which 
essence is for consciousness itself ie its shapeis in fact identicid
cal  with  its  selfconsciousness  This shape  is  itself a  selfconcid
sciousness  it is  thus  at  the  same  time  an  object in  the  mode 
of immediate being and this being likewise  immediately  has 
the significance of pure Thought of absolute Being  Theahsocid
lute  Being  which  exists  as  an  actual  selfconsciousness  seems 
to have come down from its eternal simplicity butby thus comcid
ing down it has in fact attained for the first time to its own highest 
essence  For it is  only when the  Notion of essence  has  reached 
its simple purity that it is  the absolute abstraction  which  is  pure 
Thought  and  hence  the  pure  individuality  of Self  just as  on 
account of its simplicity it is  also  the immediate  or being  What 
is called senseconsciousness isjust this pure abstraction  it is  this 
thinking  for  which  being  is  the  immediate  Thus  the  lowest 
is  at the same  time  the  highest  the revealed  which has  come 
forth  wholly on  to  the surface  is  precisely  therein  the  most pro 
found  That the supreme Being is  seen  heard etc  as  an imme 
diately  present selfconsciousness  this  therefore  is  indeed  the 
consummation of its  Notion and  through  this  consummation 
that Being is  immediately present  qua  supreme Being 

 I  This immediate existence is at the same time not solely 
and simply immediate consciousness but is  religious conscious 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

ness  the immediacy has  inseparably  the  meaning not only of 
a selfconsciousness that immediately is but also of the supreme 
Being as an absolute essence in pure thought or absolute Being 
What  we  are  conscious  of in  our  Notion  viz  that  Being  is 
Essence is what the religious consciousness is  also conscious of 
This  unity  of Being  and  Essence  of Thought which  is  immecid
diately Existence is both the thought of this religious consciouscid
ness or its mediated knowledge  and equally its  immediate  knowcid
ledge for this unity of Being and Thought is  selfconsciousness 
and is  itself immediately present  or the  thought  unity has  at the 
same time this existential shape ofwhat it is  Here therefore 
God is  revealed  as  He  is  He is  immediately present as  He is  in 
Himself ie He is immediately present as Spirit God is attainable 
in pure speculative knowledge alone and zs  only in that knowcid
ledge  and is  only  that knowledge  itself  for  He is  Spirit  and 
this speculative knowledge is  the knowledge of the revealedrelicid
gion  Speculative knowledge  knows  God  as  Thought or  pure 
Essence and knows this Thought as simple Being and as  Existcid
ence and Existence as  the negativity of itself  hence as Self as 
the Self that is  at the same  time  this  individual  and  also  the 
universal  Self  It is  precisely  this  that  the  revealed  religion 
knows  The hopes  and  expectations  of the  world  up  tiB  now 
had pressed fbrward  solely  to  thjs  revelation  to  bhold what 
absol ute Being is  and in it to find  itself  The joy of beholding 
itself in absolute Being enters selfconsciousness  and seizes  the 
whole world for it is  Spirit it is  the simple movement of those 
pure moments which expresses just this  that only when absocid
lute Being is beheld as an immediateselfconscousness is it known 
as  Spirit 

  This Notion of Spirit that knows itself as  Spirit is  itself 
the immediate Notion and is not yetdeveloped Absolute Being 
is Spirit ie it has appeared it is  revealed  this first  revelation 
is itself immediate but the immediacy is equally pure mediation 
or thought and it must therefore exhibit this in its own sphere 
as such Looking at this  more closely  Spirit in the immediacy 
of selfconsciollsness is  this  individual selfconsciousness  and so 
in an antithesis to the universal selfconsciousness It is an exclucid
sive One or unit which  has  the still unresolved form  of a  sen a 
suous other for the consciousness for  which it is  immediately 
present  This  other  does  not  as  yet  know  Spirit  as  its  own 

c  CC  RELIGION 

ie  Spirit as  an individual Self is  not yet equaUy  the  universal 
Self  the  Self of everyone  In  other  words  the  shape  has  not 
as yet the form  of the  Notion  ie  of the  universal Self  of the 
Self that in its immediate actuality is  at the same time a supercid
seded Self viz  Thought universality  without losing its actucid
ality in this  universality  But the  proximate  form  of this  unicid
versality the form  that is  itself immediate  is  not yet  the form 
of thought  itself  of the  Notion  as  Notion  but  the  universality  of 
reality  the allness or totality of the  selves  and  the  raising of 
existence into an ideational form  a in every case  and to  cite 
a  specific  example  the superseded  This  of sense  is  in  the  first 
place the Thing of perception  not yet the universal of the Undercid
standing 

  This individual man  then which  absolute  Being  has 
revealed itself to  be  accomplishes  in himself as  an individual 
the movement of sensuous Being He is  the immediately  present 
God consequently his being passes over into having been  Concid
sciousness for which God is  thus sensuously  present  ceases  to 
see  Ild  to  hear  Him  it has  seen  and  heard  Him  and  it  is 
because it only has  seen  and heard  Iiim  that it first  becomes 
itself spiritual consciousness Or in other words j lIst as formerly 
He rose  up fQr consciousness as  a sensuous existence  now He has 
arlsen in the Spirit  For a consciousness that sensuously sees and 
hears Him is itself a merely immediate consciousnesswhichbas 
not overcome the disparity of objectivity has not taken it back 
into pure thought  it  knows  this  objective individual  but not 
itself  as  Spirit  In  the  vanishing  of the  immediate  existence 
known to be absolute Being the immediacy receives its negative 
moment Spirit  remains  the  immediate  Self of actuality  but 
as  the universal selfconsciousness of the I religious  community  a 
selfconsciousness  which  reposes  in its  own  substance just  as 
in it  this  Substance is  a  universal  Subject  not  the  individual 
by  himself  but  together  with  the  consciousness  of the  comcid
munity  and  what  he  is  for  this  community  is  the  complete 
whole  of the  individual as  Spirit 

  Remoteness in  time  and space  is  however only the  impercid

fect form in which the immediate mode  of existence  is  given 
amediaed or universal character it is  merely dipped superficicid
ally in the element of Thought is  preserved in it as a  sensuous 
mode and not made one with the nature of Thought itself  It 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

is  merely  raised  into  the  realm of picturethinking  for  this  is 
the synthetic combination of sensuous immediacy  and its  uni 
versality  or Thought 

  Thisform of picturethinking constitutes the specific mode 
in which Spirit in this community becomes aware of itself This 
form is  not yet Spirits selfconsciousness  that has  advanced  to 
its  Notion qua  Notion  the mediation is  still  incomplete  This 
combination of Being and Thought is  therefore  defective  in 
that spiritual Being is still burdened with an unreconciled split 
into a  Here and a  Beyond The content is  the  true  content  but 
all its  moments when placed in the  medium of picturethinkcid
ing have the character of being uncomprehended in terms of 
the  Notion  of appearing  as  completely  independent  sides 
which are externally connected with each other Before the true 
content can also receive its true form for consciousness a higher 
formative  development  of consciousness  is  necessary  it  must 
raise  its  intuition  of absolute  Substance  into  the  Notion  and 
equate its consciousness with its selfconsciousness for itself just 
as  this  has  happened for  us  or in  itself 

  This content is  to  be considered  as  it exists  in its  concid

sciousness Absolute Spirit is  the content and is  thus in the shape 
of its  truth  But its  truth is  to  be not  merely  the Substance or 
the  in  itselfof the community  nor merely  to  step forth  out of 
this inwardness into the objectivity of picturethinking  but to 
become an actual Self to reflect itself into itself and to be Subcid
ject This therefore is the movement which it accontplishes in 
its  community  or  this  is  the  life  of  the  community  Concid
sequently what this sefrevealing Spirit is in andfor itself is  not 
elicited by as  it were unravelling the rich  life  of Spirit in  the 
community  and tracing it  back to  its  original  strands  to  the 
ideas say  of the  primitive  impetfectcommunity  or  even  to 
the  utterances of the actual  man  himself  This  tracingback 
is  based  on  the  instinct  to get  to  the  Notion  but it confuses 
the  origin  of the Notion as  the immediate existence  of its  first 
manifestation  with  the  simplicity  of the  Notion  What  results 
from this impoverishment of Spirit  from gettingrid of the idea of 
the community and its action with regard to its idea is not the 
N otlon bu t rather bare externality and singularity the historical 
mannerofthe manifestationin itsimmediacy and the nonspiricid
tual recollection of a supposed individual figure and of its past 

C  CC  RELIGION 

  Spirit is  the content of its  consciousness  at first  in  the 
form of pure substance or is the contentof its pure consciousness 
This element of Thought is  the  movement of descending into 
existence or into individuality The middle term between these 
two is  their synthetic connection  the  consciousness  of passing 
into othrness or picturethinking as such  The third moment 
is  the  return from  picturethinking and otherness  or  the  elecid
ment  of selfconsciousness  itself  These  three  moments  concid
stitute Spirit its  dissociation in picturethinking consists  in its 
existing in a specific or determinate  mode but this determinatecid
ness is nothing else than one of its moments Its complete move 
ment is  therefore  this  to diffuse its nature  throughout each of 
its moments as in its native element since each of these spheres 
completes itself within itself  this  reflection  of one sphere into 
itself is  at  the same time  the  transition  into  another  Picturecid
thinking constitutes the middle term between pure thought and 
self  consciousness  as  such  and  is  only  one  of  the  specific  or 
determina te forms at thesame time however as weha ve seen 
its characterthat of being a synthetic connectionis diffused 
throughout  all  these  elements  and  is  their  common  detercid
minateness 

  The content itselfwhich we have to consider has partly 
been  met with  already as  the  idea  of the  unhappy aJlo  the 
beljeving consciousness but in the fonner itbas the character 
of a  content  produced  from  consciousness  for  which  Spirit 
yearns  and  in  which  Spirit  cannot  be  satiated  or  find  rest 
because it is not yet in  itseljits own content or is  not  the Subcid
stance of it  Inthe believing consciousness on the other hand 
the content was regarded as the self  less Being of the world or 
as  essentially  an  objective  content  of  picture thinking  of  a 
picturethinking thatsimplyfleesfrom reality and conseq uently 
is without the certainty of selfconsciousness which is separated 
from  it partly by  the  conceit  of knowing and  partly  by  pure 
imdght  The  consciousness  of the  community  on  the  other 
hand possesses the content for its substance just as  the content 
is  the certainty  of the  communitys ownSpirit 

  When Spirit is  at first conceived of as substance in the 
element  of pure  thought  it  is  immediately  simple  and  self  
identical eternal  essence  which  does  not  however  have  this 
abstract meaning of essence but the meaning of absolute Spirit 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

Only Spirit is  not a  meaning is  not what is  inner  but what 
is actual Therefore simple eternal essence would be Spirit only 
as  a  form of empty words if we went no further than  the idea 
expressed  in  the  phrase  simple  eternal  essence  But  simple 
essence because it is  an abstraction is  in fact  the negative in 
its own self and moreover the negativity of thought or negacid
tivity as  it is  in itself in essence  ie  simple essence  is  absolute 
difference  from  itself  or its  pure othering of itself  As  essence  it 
is only in itself or for us but since this  purity is just abstraction 
or negativity it isfor itself or is  the Self  the Notion  It is  thus 
objective  and since  picturethinking interprets and expresses 
as  a happening  what  has  just been  expressed  as  the  necessity  of 
the  Notion it is  said that the eternal Being begets  for  itself an 
other But in this otherness it has at the same time immediately 
returned into itself for  the difference is  the difference  in  itself 
Ie  it is  immediately distinguished only from  itself and is  thus 
the  unity  that has returned into itself 

  There are thus three distinct moments essence  beingcid

forself which is  the otherness of essence and for which essence 
is  and  being  forself  or  the  knowledge  of itself in  the  other 
Essence  beholds  only  its  own selfin its  beingforself  in  this 
externaHzation of itself it stays only with itself  the  beingforcid
self that shuts itself out from  essence  is  essences  knowledge  of its 
own  self  It is  the  word  which  When  uttered  leaves  behind 
externalized and emptied him who uttered it  but which is  as 
immediately  heard  and  only  this  hearing  of its  own  self is 
the eXIstence of the Word Thus the distinctions  made are imcid
mediately resolved as soon as  they are made and are made as 
soon as they are resolved and what is true and actualis precisely 
this  immanent circular move men  

  This  immanent  movement  proclaims  the  absolute 
Being as  Spirit  Absolute Being that is  not grasped as  Spirit is 
merely the abstract void just as  Spirit  that is  not grasped  as 
this  movement is  only an  empty  word  When  its  moments  are 
graspedintheir purity they are the restless Notions which only 
are  in  being in  themselves  their own opposite  and in finding 
their rest in the whole But the picturethinking of the religious 
community is  not this speculative thinking it has the content 
but withoutits necessity and instead of the form of the Notion 
it brings into the realm of pure consciousness the natural rela 

C  CC  RELIGION 

tionships  of father  and  son  Since  this  consciousness  even  in 
its  thinking remains at  the  level of picturethinking  absolute 
Being is  indeed revealed  to  it  but the moments of this  Being 
on account of this   empirically  synthetic  presentation  partly 
themselves  fall  asunder  so  that  they  are  not  related  to  one 
another through their own Notion and partly this consciousness 
retreats  from  this  its  pure object  relating itself to  it only  in 
an external manner  The object is  revealed to it  by something 
alien apd  it does  not recognize itself in this  thought of Spirit 
does  not  recognize  the  nature  of pure  selfconsciousness  In 
so far as the form of picturethinking and of those relationships 
derived from Nature must be transcended and especially also 
the  standpoint  which  takes  the  moments  of the  movement 
which Spirit is  as  isolated immovable Substances or Subjects 
instead of transient momentsthe transcending of this  standcid
point  is  to  be  regarded  as  a  compulsion  on  the  part of the 
Notion  as  we  pointed  out earlier in connection with another 
aspect Byt since  this  compulsion is  instinctive self  consciouscid
nessmisunderstands its own nature rejects  the content as wen 
as the form and what amounts to the same thing degrades the 
conten t  into  a  historical  pictorial  idea  and  to  an  heirloom 
handed down by tradition  In this  way  it  is  only  the  purely 
external  element  in  belief that is  retained  and  as  something 
therefore  that is  dead and cannot be known but the inner ele  
ment in faith has vanished  because this would  be  the  Notion 
that knows  itself as  Notion 

  Absolute Spirit as pictured in pure essence is not indeed 
abstract pure essence for abstract essence has sunk  to  the level 
of being merely an element just because it is  only a  moment in 
the life of  Spirit But the  representation of Spirit in  this  elecid
ment is  charged with  the same defect of form  which essence  as 
such has Essence is an abstraction and is therefore the negation 
of its simple  unitary nature is  an other similarly  Spirit in 
the element of essence is  the form  of simple oneness  which therecid
fore  is equally essentially an othering of itself  Or what is  the 
same  thing  the  relation of the eternal  Being  to  its  beingforo 
selfis the immediately simple one of pure thought In this simple 
beholding of itself in the other  the otherness  is  therefore  not 
posited as such it is  the  difference which in  pure  thought is 
immediately no  difference  a loving recognition in which the  two 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

sides  as  regards  their essence  do  not stand in an antithetical 
relation  to  each other  Spirit  that is  expressed  in  the  element 
of pure though tis itself essentially this  to be not merely in this 
element but to be actual  Spirit  for  in  its  Notion  lies  otherness 
itself  ie  the  supersession  of the  pure  Notion  that  is  only 
thought 

  The element of pure thought because it is  an abstract 
element is itself rather the other  of its simple  unitary nature 
and therefore  passes  over into the element proper  to  picturecid
thinkingthe  element  in  which  the  moments  of  the  pure 
Notion obtain a substantial existence relatively  to  one another 
and also  are  Subjects which  do  not possess  for  a  third  the incid
difference  towards  each other of mere  being  but  being  recid
flected  into  themselves  spontaneously  part  asunder  and  also 
place  themselves over against each other 

  Thus the merely eternal or abstract Spirit becomes an 
other to itself or enters into existence and directly into immecid
diate  existence  Accordingly it creates  a  world  This  creating 
is  picturethinkingsword for  the  Notion  itself in  its  absolute 
movement or to express the fact thatthe simple which has been 
asserted as absolute or pure thoughtjust because it is abstract 
is  rather the negative and hence theself  opposed or other  of 
itself orbeca use to pu tthesame thingin another form  tha t which 
is  posited as essence is  simple  immediacy  or heing  but qua  immecid
diacy or being lacks Self and  therefore  lacking inwardness  is 
passive ora beingforanother Thisheingforanotheris at the same 
time a world Spirit in the determination of beingforanother 
is the inert subsistence of the moments formerly enclosed within 
pure thought  is  therefore  the dissolution  of their simple  unicid
versalityand the parting asunder of them into their own particid
cularity 

  But the world is not merely this Spirit cast out and discid

persed into the fulness  of natural existence  and  its  external 
ordering for since S piri t  is  essentially the simple Self  this Self 
is  equally presentin the world  it is  the  existent  Spirit  which 
is  the individual Selfwhich has consciousness and distinguishes 
itself as  other or as  world from itself  This individual Self as 
at first  thus  immediately posited  is  not yet Spirit for  itself  it 
does  not exist as  Spirit it can  be  called  innocent  but hardly 
good  Before  it  can  in  fact  be  Self and  Spirit  it  must  first 

C  CC  RELIGION 

 
become  an  other  to  its  own  self  just  as  the  eternal  Being 
exhibits itselfas the movement of being selfidentical in its othcid
erness  Since  this  Spirit  is  determined  as  at first  an  immediate 
existence or as  dispersed  into  the  multifariousness  of its  concid
sciousness  its  othering of itself is  the  withdrawal into  itself  or 
selfcentredness of knowing as such  Immediate existence sudcid
denly  turns  into  thought  or  mere  senseconsciousness  into 
consciousness of though t and  moreover because the  thought 
stems  from  immediacy or is  conditioned  thought  it is  not  pure 
knowledge but thought that is  charged with  otherness  and is 
therefore  the selfopposed  thought of Good  and Evil  Man is 
pictorially thought of in this way that it once happened without 
any necessity that he lost the form of being at one with himself 
through plucking the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good 
and  Evil  and  was  expelled from  the state of innocence  from 
Nature which yielded its fruits without toil and from Paradise 
from  the  garden with  its  creatures  

   Since  this  withdrawal into itself or selfcentredness  of 
theeistent conscioilsnessimmediatelymakes it selfdiscordant 
Evil  appears  as  theprimryexistenceof theinwardly  turned 
consciousness and because tbe thoughts of Good and Evil are 
utterly opposed and this antithesis is not yet resolved  this concid
sciousncs isessentially  onlY  evil  But  at  the  arne  time  on 
accountpfjllst this an ti thcis  there is also present the good concid
sciollness opposing it  and  their relation  to  each other  In so 
far as immediate eistencsuddenly changes into  Thought  and 
the  beingwithinself is  on  the  one hand itself a  thinking  while 
on the other hand the mornclt of theotheying of essence is  more 
precisely determined by it  becauseofthis double aspect  the 
becoming of Evil can be shifted further hack outof the existent 
world even into the primary realm of Thought I t can therefore 
be said that it is  the vry firstborn Son of Light Lucifer himcid
self who feU  because he withdrew into  himself or became selfcid
centrd but that in his place another was at once created Such 
a form of expression as  fallen which like the expression  Son 
belongs moreover to picturethinking and not to  the  Notion 
degrades  the  moments  of the  Notion  to  the  level  of picturecid
thinking  or  carries  picturemthinking  over  into  the  realm  of 
though t  Likewise  it  makes  no  difference  if we  coordinate  a 
multiplicity of other shapes with the simple thought of otherness 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

in the eternal Being and  transfer  the seljcentredness  into  them 
In fact  this  coordination  must be  approved since  by  means 
ofit this moment of otherness also expresses diversity as it should 
and moreover not as plurality in general but also as a specific 
diversity so that one part the Son is  that which is  simple and 
knows  itself to  be  essential  Being  while  the  other  part is  the 
alienation the externalization of beingforself which lives only 
to praise that Being to  this part then can be assigned  the takcid
ing back again of the externalized beingforself and the withcid
drawal into self of the evil principle  In so far  as  the  otherness 
falls  into  two  parts  Spirit  might  as  regards  its  momentsif 
these are to be countedbe more  exactly expressed  as  a  quacid
ternity in  unity or  because  the quantity itself again falls  into 
two parts viz one part which has remained good and the other 
which has  become evil  might even be  expressed  as  a  fiveincid
one  But to count  the  moments  can  be  reckoned  as  altogether 
useless since in the first place what is  differentiated is  itself just 
as much only one thingvizthe thought of the difference which 
is  only one  thoughts it the  differentiated  is  this  differenticid
ated element  the second relatively to  the first  And secondly 
itis useless to countbecause the thoughtwhich grasps the Many 
in aGne mustbedissolved out of its universality and differenticid
atedinto more than three or four distinct components and this 
universality appears in contrast to the absolute  determinatecid
ness  of the  abstract  unit  the  principle of number  as  indetercid
minateness  with  respect to  number as  such so  that we  could 
speak only of numbers in general ie  not ofa specific numher 
of differences  Here  therefore  it is  quite superfluous  to  think 
of numbers  and  counting  at all Just  as  in  other  respects  the 
mere difference of quantity and amount has no notional significid
cance and makes  no difference 

  Good and Evil were  the specific differences yielded by 

the thought of Spirit as  immediately existent Since their anticid
thesis  has  not yet been resolved  and  they  are  conceived  of as 
the essence  of thought  each  of them  having  an  independent 
existence  of its  own  man  is  a  self lacking  any  essential  being 
and is  the synthetic ground of their existence and their conflict 
But these  universal  powers just as  much  belong to the self  or 
the sef is  their actuality  I n  accordance with  this  moment it 
therefore comes to  pass  that just as  Evil is  nothing other  than 

c  ce  RELIGION 

  
the selfcentredness  of the natural  existence  of Spirit so  concid
versely Good enters into actuality and appears  as  an existent 
selfconsciousness  That which in the pure thought of Spirit is 
in general merely hinted at as  the othering  of the divine  Being 
here comes  nearer to  its  realization  for  picturethinking  this 
realization consists  for  picturethinking in  the  selfabasement 
of the divine Being who renounces his  abstract and nonactual 
nature  Picturethinking  takes  the  other  aspect  evil  to  be  a 
happening alien  to  the divine Being  to grasp it in  the  divine 
Being itself as the wrath of God  this demands from picturethinkcid
ing  struggling  against  its  limitations  its  supreme  and  most 
strenuous  effort  an  effort  which  since  it  lacks  the  Notion 
remains  frui dess  

  The alienation of the divine Being is  thus made explicit 
in its  twofold  form  the  Self of Spirit  and  its  simple  thought 
are  the  two  moments  whose  absolute  unity is  Spirit  itself  Its 
alienation  consists  in  the  moments  going  apart  from  one 
another and in one of them having an unq ua value compared 
withthe other This disparityis therefore twofold and tworelacid
tionships  arise whose  common  moments  are  those just given 
Inone of them the divine Being counts as essence while natural 
existence and the Self COllnt  as  the unessential aspect which is 
to besupersedd  In  the other on  the contrary  beingforself 
counts as  the essential and the simple divine Being as  unessencid
tiaL  Their still  empty  middle  term  is  existence  in  general  the 
bare community of their  two  moments 

  This antithesisis resolved not so much through the concid

flict  hetween the two  moments which are pictured as  separate 
and independent Beings their very independence implies that 
eaq  of them in  its  own self  through its  Notion  must  resolve 
itself The conflict begins where both cease to be these minglings 
of thought and of independent existence and where they concid
front each other only as thoughts For then they are as  specific 
Notions only in the relation of an antithesis  as  independent 
on the other hand they have their essentiality outside of their 
antithesis  Their  movement  is  therefore  their  own  free  and 
spontaneous  movement  As  then  the  movement  of the  two 
sides is an intrinsic movement since it is  to be considered in the 
sides themselves it is  initiated by that side which is  determined 
as  possessing beinginitself as  contrasted with  the  other  This 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
is depicted as a spontaneous act but the necessity for its  extercid
nalization lies in the Notion that beinginitself which is  so  decid
termined in the antithesis has just for  that reason no  genuine 
subsistence  It is  therefore that side which has  not beingforcid
selfbut simple being as its essence that alienates itself from itself 
yields  to  death  and  thereby  reconciles  absolute  essence  with 
itself For in this movement it manifests itselfas Spirit abstract 
essence is alienated from itself it has natural existence and selfcid
like actuality this its otherness or its sensuous presence is taken 
back again by the second othering and  posited as  superseded 
as  universal  The absolute  essence  has  thereby  come  to be its 
own Self in its sensuous  presence  the immediate  existence  of 
actuality has ceased to be something alien and external for the 
absolute essence since that existence is superseded is  universal 
This death is  therefore  its  resurrection  as  Spirit 

  The  transcended  immediate  presence  of the  selfconcid

scious essence has the form of universal selfconsciousness  This 
Notion of the transcended individual self that is  absolute Being 
immediately  expresses  therefore  the establishing  of a  comcid
munity which tarrying hitherto in  the sphere of picturethinkcid
ing now returns into itself as  the Self and in doing this Spirit 
passes  over from  the second element constituting  it  ie  from 
picturethinking  into  the  third  element  selfconsciousness  as 
such  If we further consider the behaviour of picturethinking 
in its progress we find first of all the declaration that the divine 
Being takes  on  human nature  Here it is  already  asserted  that 
in themselves thetwo are not separate likewise in the declaration 
tha t  the divine Being from  tke  beginning  externalizes  itself  that 
its existence withdraws into itself and becomes selfcentred and 
evil implies  though it does  not expressly assert  that this  evil 
existence  is  not  in  itself something  alien  to  the  divine  Being 
Absolute Being would be but an empty name if in  truth  there 
were for it an other if there were a  fall from it on the  concid
trary  the  moment  of beingwithin  self constitutes  the  essential 
moment of the Self of Spirit That this beingwitkinself and  the 
actuality which follows from it belong to absolute Being itself 
this which for us is  Notion  and in so far as it is  Notion appears 
to  the  picturethinking consciousness  as  an  incomprehensible 
happening the initselfassumes for it the form of indifferent being 
The thought that those  moments of absolute Being and  of the 

C  CC  RELIGION 

 
selfcentred  Self which  seem  to  flee  from  each  other  are  not 
separate also appears in this  picturethinkingfor it does  poscid
sess  the true contentbut this  picturethought comes later  in 
the externalization of the divine Being who is  made flesh  The 
picturethought is in this way still immediate  and therefore  not 
spiritual ie  it knows  the  human form  of the  divine Being at 
first  only as  a  particular  not yet  as  a  universal  form  it  becid
comes spiritual for this consciousness in the movement whereby 
this  divine  Being  in  human  shape  sacrifices  his  immediate 
exis tenceagain andreturns to thedivine Being only w hen essence 
is  reflected into itself is  it Spirit  In  this  picturethought there 
is depicted the reconciliation of the divine Being with its other 
in  general  and  specifically  with  the  thought  of  itEvil  If 
this reconciliation is notionally  expressed  by saying that it concid
sists  in  the  fact  that Evil  is  in  itself the  same  as  Goodness  or 
again that the  divine Being is  the  same  as  Nature in its  whole 
extent or that Nature separatedfrom the divine Being is simply 
nothingwe must regard this as an unspiritual way of talking 
and one that is necessarily bound to give rise to misunderstand  
ings  If EvH is  the same as  Goodness  then Evil is just not Evil 
nor  Goodness  Good  on  the  contrary  both  are  suspended 
momentsEvil  in  general  is  selfcentred  beingforself  and 
Goodness  is  what  is  simple  and  without  a  self  When  thus 
expressed in terms of their Notion their unity is a t once eviden t  
for  self centred  beingforself is  simple  knowing  and  simple 
being  that lacks a  Self is  eq ually  pure selfcentred  being  for 
self  If  therefore it must  be said  that according to  this  their 
Notion Good and Evil ie  in so far as  they are not  Good and 
Evil are the same it must also no less  emphatically be asserted 
that they are not  the same  but are utterly different  for simple 
being  forself  or  pure  knowing  too  is  each  in  its  own  self 
equally  pure  negativity  or  absolute  difference  The  whole  is 
only complete  when  the  two  propositions  are  made  together 
and  when  the  first  is  asserted  and  maintained  it  must  be 
countered by clinging to the other with invincible stubbornness 
Since both are equally right they are both equally wrong and 
the mistake consists in taking such abstract forms  as  the same 
and not the same  identiti and  nonidentity  to  be  somecid
thing true fixed  and actual and in resting on  them  Neither 
the one nor the other has truth the truth is just their movement 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
in which simple sameness is  an abstraction and hence absolute 
difference but this as  difference in itself is  distinguished from 
itself and is therefore selfsameness This is precisely the case with 
the  selfsameness  of the  divine  Being  and  Nature  in  general 
and human nature in particular the former is  Nature in so far 
as  it is  not  essential  Being  and  the  latter  is  divine  according 
to  its  essence  But it is  Spirit in  which  the  truth  of these  two 
abstract  sides  is  made  explicit  viz  by  reducing  them  to 
suspended moments an explication which cannot be expressed 
by  the judgement and  the lifeless  is  which  forms  its  copula 
Similarly Nature is  nothing apart from its  essence but this same 
nothing just as much is it is an absolute abstraction and thus 
pure thought or beingwithinself and with the moment of its 
antithesis to  the spiritual unity it is  Evil  The difficulty  that is 
found in these IN otions s terns solely from clinging to the is  and 
forgetting  the  thinking of the  Notions  in  which  the  moments 
j ustas much are  as  they are notare only the movement which 
is Spirit his this spiritual unity or the  unity in which the dif 
ferences  are  prsentonlyas moments  or as  suspended  which 
has  become explicit for  the  picturethinking  consciousness  in 
that reconciliation spoken ofabovc and since  this  unity is  the 
universality of selfconsciousness selfconsciousness  has  ceased 
to thinkin pictures  the movement has returned into sefcon 
sciousness 

  Spirit is  thus posited in  the  third  element  in  universal 
seifconsciousness  iists community  The movement of the com 
munity as  selfconsciousness that has  distinguished  itself from 
its picturethoughtis to make explicit what has been implicitly 
established The dead divine Man or human God is  in  himself 
the universalselfconsciousness  this he has to become explicitly 
for  this  seljconsciusnessOr  since  this  selfconsciousness concid
stitutes  one  side  of the  antithesis  in  picturethought  viz  the 
side orevil for which natural existence and individual selfconcid
sciousness count as essencethis side which is pictured as indecid
pendent not yet as a  moment  has  on  account of its  indepencid
dence to  raise itself through its own nature to Spirit ie  it has 
to  exhibit in its  own self the  movement of Spirit 

  Thisselfconscousness  is  natural  Spirit  the  self has  to 
withdraw  from  this  natural  existence  and  retreat  into  itself 
which would  mean to become euil  But  this  side is  already in 

C  CO  RELIGION 

 
itself evil its withdrawal into itself consists therefore in convinccid
ing itself that natural existence is evil  For the consciousness that 
thinks  in  pictures  the world has  actually  become  and  is  evil 
and  the  propitiation  of the  absolute  Being was  a  real  event 
bpt  in  selfconsciousness  as  such  what  is  thus  pictured  as 
happening as an event has as  regards its form  the significance 
only of a  suspended  moment  for  the  self is  the  negative  and 
hence  a  knowinga  knowing  that  is  a  pure  act within  concid
sciousness  itself  This  moment  of  the  negative  must  likewise 
express itselfin the content Thatis to say since absolute Being 
is  already reconciled with itself in  itself and is  a  spiritual unity 
in which the  parts of the picturethought are suspended or are 
moments what is  expressed in  the content is  that each  part of 
the picturethought here receives the opposite  meaning to what 
it  had  before  each  meaning  thereby  completes  itself in  the 
other and onlythrough  this  selfcompletion  is  the  content  a 
spiri tual one since the determinateness is j us t as much its oppocid
site  unity  in  otherness  ie  the  spiritual relationship  is  an 
accomplished fact just as  the oPPQsite  meaning  were united 
previousiyfor us or in themselves and even the abstract forms 
ofthesame and not thesame of identity and nonidentity 
were  reduced  to  moments 

  If  then  in  the  picturethinking consciousness  theincid

wardizing of natural selfconsciousness was the real existence of 
evil that inwardizingin the elementofself  consciousness is  the 
knowledge of evil  as  something that is  implicit in existence  This 
knowledge is  of curse a  genesis of evil  but only a  genesis  of 
the  thought  of evil  and  is  therefore  recognized  as  the  first 
moment of reconciliation  For as a withdrawal into itself from 
the immediacy of Nalure which  is  determined  as  evil  it is  a 
forsaking of that immediacy and a  dying away of sin  It is  not 
natural existence as such that is  forsaken  by consciousness but 
natural existence  that is  at the same  time known as  evil  The 
immediate  movement of withdrawal into  self is  just as  much a 
mediated movement it presupposes itself or is its own ground 
that  is  to  say  the  ground  of the  withdrawal  into  self is  that 
Nature has  already withdrawn  into itself  on account of evil 
man  must  withdraw  into  himself  but evil  is  itself  the  withcid
qrawal in to self This firs t movemen t is for that very reason only 
immediate  or the  simple  Notion  of that  movement  because  it 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
is  the same as  what its  ground is  The  movement or othering 
has therefore still to appear but in its own more characteristic 
form 

  Besides  this  immediacy  therefore  the  mediation  of the 

picturethought is necessary The knowledge of Nature as the uncid
true existence  of Spirit  and  this  immanently  developed  unicid
versality of the Self is  in  itself the  reconciliation of Spirit with 
itself For the selfconsciousness that does not think in terms of 
the Notion this initself receives the form of something that poscid
sesses immediate being and is imaginatively represented Comcid
prehension is therefore for that selfconsciousness not a  graspcid
ing of this  Notion  which  knows  superseded  natural existence 
to be universal and therefore reconciled with itself but rather 
a grasping of the imaginative idea that by bringing to  pass its 
own externalization in its historical incarnation and death the 
divine  Being has  been reconciled with  its  natural  existence 
The grasping of this  idea now expresses  more definitely what 
was previously called the spiritual resurrection in this same concid
text ie the coming into existence of Gods individual selfconcid
sciousness  as  a  universal selfconsciousness  or as  the  religious 
community  The  death  of the  divine  Man  as  death  is  abstract 
negativity the immediate result of the  movement which ends 
only in natural  universality  Death loses  this  natural  meaning 
in spiritual selfconsciousness ie  it comes  to  be its just stated 
Notion death becomes transfiguredfrom its immediate meancid
ing viz the nonbeing of this particular individual into the unicid
versality  of the  Spirit who  dwells  in His  community  dies  in  it 
every day  and is  daily  resurrected 

  Thus what belongs to the element of picturethinking viz 
that absolute  Spirit qua  individual  orrather  qua  particular 
Spirit  presents  the  nature of Spirit in its  natural  existence 
is here shifted into selfconsciousness itself into knowledge that 
preserves itselfin its otherness This selfconsciousness therefore 
does  not  actually  die  as  the  particular  selfconsciousness  is 
pictured as being actually dead hutits particularity dies away 
inits universality ie in its knowledge which is essential Being 
reconciling itself with  itself  The  immediately  preceding  elecid
ment of picturethinking is  therefore here explicitly set aside 
or it has  returned into the Self  into its  Notionwhat was  in 
the former merely in the element of being has become a Subject 

C  CC  RELIGION 

By  this very fact  the  first  element  too  pure  thinking and  the 
eternal  Spirit  therein  is  no  longer  beyond  the  picturing  con 
sciousness or beyond  the Self on the contrary  the return into 
itself of the  whole  is  just  this  to  contain  within  itself all  the 
moments  The death  of the  Mediator  as  grasped  by  the  Self 
is  the  supersession  of his  objective  existence  or  his  particular 
beingforself  this  particular  beingfor  self has  become  a  unicid
versal  selfconsciousness  On  the  other  side  the  universal  has 
become self  consciollsness just because of this and the  pure or 
nonactual Spirit of mere thinking has become actual  The death 
of the  Mediator is  the  death  not  only  of his  natural  aspect  or 
of his particular beingforself not only of the already dead husk 
stripped of its  essential Being  but also  of the  abstraction  of the 
divine Being  For the  Mediator in so  far  as  his  death has  not 
yet  completed  the  reconciliation  is  the  onesidedness  which 
takes as essential Being the simple element of thought in contrast 
to actuality this onesided extreme of the Self does  not as  yet 
have equal worth with essential Being this it first has  as  Spirit 
The  death of this  picture  thought  contains  therefore  at  the 
same  time  the  death of the  abstraction  of the  divine  Being which 
is  not posited as  Self  That dea this the  painful  feeling  of the 
Unhappy Consciousness that GodHimseLJ is dead  This hard saycid
ing is  the  expression  of innermost simple selfknowledge the 
return  of consciousness into  the  depths  of the  night in  which 
P P a  night which no longer distinguishes  or knows  anycid
thing outside of it This feelingis  in fact  the loss  of substance 
and  of its  appearance  over against  consciousness  but it is  at 
the  same  time  the  pure  subjectivity  of substance j  or  the  pure 
certainty of itself which it lacked when it was object or the imcid
mediate or pure  essence  This  Knowing is  the inbreathing of 
the  Spirit whereby Substance becomes Subject  by  which  its 
abstraction and lifelessness have died  and Substance therefore 
has  become  actual  and  simple  and  universal  elf  conscious 
ness 

  In  this  way  therefore  Spirit js  selfknowing  Spirit  it 
knows itselfthat which is object for it is or its  picturethought 
is  the true absolute content as  we saw it expressed Spirit itself 
Itis atthe same time not merely the content ofselfconscious 
ness and not merely objectfor it but it is also actual Spirit  This 
it is  because it runs  through  the three elements  of its  nature 

THE  REVEALED  RELIGION 

 
the movement through its own phases constitutes its  actuality 
What moves  itself  that is  Spirit it is  the Subject of the  movecid
ment and is  equally the moving itself or the substance  through 
which  the  Subject  moves  The  Notion  of Spirit  which  had 
emerged for  us as  we entered the sphere of religion viz  as  the 
movement of self  certain  Spirit  which  forgives  evil  and  in  so 
doing abandons  its  own  simple  unitary  nature  and  rigid  uncid
changeableness or  as  the  movement  in  which  what  is  in  an 
absolute antithesis recognizes itself as  the same as  its  opposite 
this  recognition  bursting forth  as  the  affirmative  between  these 
extremesthis Notion is  intuitively  apprehended  by  the  religious 
consciousness  to  which  the  absolute  Being  is  revealed  and 
which overcomes  the  difference  between  its  Self and  what  it 
intuitively apprehends just as  it  is  Subject  so  also  it is  subcid
stance  and  hence  it is  itself Spirit just because  and  in  so  far 
as  it is  this  movement 

  But the community is  not yet  perfected  in this  its  selfcid
consciousness  in general  its  content exists  for  it in  the  form 
of picturethinking  and the duality in this thinking still attaches 
even to the actual spirituality of the community to its return out 
ofi tspicturethinking  just as  the element of pure thought itself 
was burdened withit The community also does not possess the 
consciousness ofw ha tit is it is s piritualsefconsciousness which 
is not an object toitsef as this selfconsciousness orw hich does 
not unfolditselftoa consciousness of itself but rather in so far 
as  itis consciousness  it has  those  picturethoughts  which  we 
have  considered  We see  selfmconsciousness at  its  last  turningcid
point become inward toitselfand attain to a knowledge of its incid
wardness  we  see  it  divest  itself of its  natural  existence  and 
acquire pure negativity But the positive meaning viz  that this 
negativity or pure inwardness of knowledge is just as  much the 
selfidentical  essenceor in  other  words  that  substance  has 
here succeeded  in  becoming  absolute  seWconsciousnessthis 
is  an  other  for  the  devotional  consciousness  It grasps  this 
aspect viz  that the pure inwardization of knowledge is  in  itself 
absolute  simplicity  or  substance  as  the  picturethought  of 
something which  is  so  not in  virtue  of its  Notion  but as  the 
deed of an alien  satisfaction  In other words  it does  not grasp 
the fact  that this depth of the pure Self is  the  power  by which 
the abstract divine Being is drawn down from its abstraction and 

C  ce  RELIGION 

raised to a  Self by the  power of this  pure devotion  The action 
of the Selfretains towards it this negative meaning because the 
externalization  the  kenosis  of substance  is  taken  by  the  Sel 
to  be  an action  implicit  in  the  nature  of substance  the  Self 
does  not grasp and truly comprehend it or does  not find  it in 
its own action as such This unity of essence and the Self having 
been implicitly achieved consciousness too still has this picturecid
thought of its reconciliation but as a picturetheught It obtains 
satisfaction by externally attaching to its pure negativity the posicid
tive  meaning of the  unity of itself with  the essential  Being its 
satisfaction  thus itself remains  burdened with  the antithesis of 
a beyond Its own reconciliation therefore enters its  conscious 
ness as something distant as something in the distantfuture just 
as  the reconciliation which  the  other Self achieved appears  as 
something in the distant past  Just as  the individual divine  Man 
has  a  father  in  principle  and  only  an  actual  mother  so  too  the 
universal divine Man the community has for its father its own 
doing and knowing  but for  its  mother  eternal  love  which  it 
only feels  but does not behold in its onsciousnessis an actual 
imrnediateohject Its reconciliation therefore is in its heart but 
its consciousness is still dividedagainstitself and its actual world 
is stiUclisrupted  What enters its  consciousness  as  the  initself 
or the side ofpure mediation isa reconciliation thatlies in the 
beyond  but what entrs it as  present  as  the  side  of immedzacy 
and existence is the world which has still to await iis trausfigura 
tion  The world is  indeed implicztly  reconciled with the  divine 
Being aug regaring the  ivine Being it is  known  of course 
that it recognizs the object as  no longer alienated from it but 
as  identical with it in its  love  But  for  selfconsciousness  this 
immediate prsencestin has not the shape of Spirit The Spirit 
of the community is thus in its immediate consciousness divided 
from its  religious consciousness which declares it is  true that 
in  themselves  they are not divided hut this  merely implicit  unity 
isoot realized or has not yet become an equally absolute being  
forself 

DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

VIII  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

  The  Spirit  of the  revealed  religion  has  not  yet  surcid

mounted its consciousness as such orwhat is the same its actual 
selfconsciousness  is  not  the  object  of its  consciousness  Spirit 
itselfas a whole and the selfdifferentiated moments within it 
fall  within  the  sphere  of picturethinking  and  in  the  form  of 
objectivity  The  content  of  this  picturethinking  is  absolute 
Spirit and all that now remains to be done is  to supersede this 
Inere form  or rather since  this  belongs  to consciousness  as  such 
its  truth must already have yielded itself in  the shape of con a 
sciousness  This surmounting of the  object  of consciousness  is 
notto be taken onesidedly to mean that the object showed itself 
as  returning into the Self  but is  to  be  taken mOfe  specifically 
to  mean not only that the object as such presented itself to the 
Selfas vanishing butrather that itis the externalization of selfcid
consciousness that posits the thinghood or the object and that 
this  externalization  has  not  merely  a  negative  but  a  positive 
meaning  a  meaning which is  not only for  us  or  in  itself  but 
for selfconsciousness  itself  The negative  of the  object  or its 
selfsupersession has a  positive meaning for selfconsciousness 
ie  selfconsciousness  knows  the  nothingness  of the  object  on 
the one  hand because it externalizes its  own  selffor in  this 
externalization it posits  itself as  object or  the  object  as  itself 
in virtue of the  indivisible  unity of beingjorselj  On the  other 
hand this positing at the same time contains the other moment 
viz thatseIfconsciousness has equally superseded this externalcid
ization and objectivity too  and taken it back into itself so  that 
it is  in communion with itself in  its  otherness as  such  This  is 
thernovement of consciousness and in that movement consciouscid
ness is  the  totality ofit moments  Equally consciousness  must 
have related itself to  the object in accordance with the totality 
of the latters determinations and have thus grasped it from the 
standpoint of each of them  This  totality of its  determinations 
establishes the object as an implkitly spiritual being and it does 

C  DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

truly become a spiritual being for  consciousness  when  each of 
its individual determinations is  grasped as  a  determination of 
the Self or through  the spiritual relationship to  them that was 
just mentioned 

  Thus the object is in partimmediate being or in general 
a  Thingcorresponding to immediate consciousness  in  part 
an  othering  of itself  its  relationship  or  beingforanother  and 
beingforitself  ie  determinatenesscorresponding to  percepcid
tion and in part essence  or in the  form  of a  universalcorrecid
sponding to  the Understanding  It is  as  a  totality  a  syllogism 
or the movement of the universal through determination to incid
dividuality  as  also  the  reverse  movement from  individuality 
through superseded individuality  or through  determination 
to  the universal It is therefore in accordance with these  three 
determinations  that  consciousness  must  know  the  object  as 
itself  However this  Knowing of which we are speaking is  not 
Knowing as  pure comprehension of the oject  ie  in  terIJls  of 
the Notion here  this  Knowing is  to  be indicated only in its 
process  of cOlningtobe or in the  moments  of that  aspect  of 
it which helongs  to  consciousnes as  sucr  the  moments  of the 
Notion proper or of pure nowing in theformofshapesofcqncid
sciougness For this reason theohject does not yet appearincQncid
sciousness  as  such  as  the  spiritual  essentiality  we  have  just 
affirmed it to  be and the  relationship of consciousness  to it is 
not the consideration ofit in this totaJityas such nor inits pure 
form as Notion but it is from one side a shape of consciousness 
as such and from the other side a number of such shapes which 
we bring together in which the totality of the  moments  of the 
object and of the rdation of consciousness to it can be indicated 
only  as  resolved into its  moments 

  For thisaspect of the  apprehension  of the  object  Le 
as it exists in the shape of consciousness we have only to recall 
the earlier shapes of consciousness already encountered Thus 
in  regard  to  the object so  far  as  it is  an immediacy  ie  is  an 
indifferent  being  we  saw  Observing  Reason  seeking  and finding 
itself in  this  indifferent thing ie  we saw it equally conscious 
ofits action being external to it as it was conscious of the object 
only as  an  immediate object  And we saw Observing Reason 
at its peak express its specific character in the infinite judgement 
that  the being  qf the l is  a  Thing  and  moreover  a  sensuous 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

immediate Thing When the  I is  called soul  it is  true  that it 
is  also  represented  as  a  Thing  but as  something invisible  incid
tangible etc and therefore in fact not as  an immediate being 
and not as what is  meant by a  Thing  That judgement  taken 
just as  it stands  is  nonspiritual pr  rather is  the  nonspiritual 
itself  In its Notion however it is  in fact the most richly spiritcid
ual and this inner significance of what is not yet apparent is what 
is  expressed  in  the  two other moments  to  be considered 

  The  Thing  is   in point of fact  in  this  infinite judgecid
ment the Thing is superseded in itselfit is nothing it has meancid
ing only in the relation only through the P and its connection with 
it  This moment manifested itself for  consciousness  in  pure incid
sight and enlightenment Things are simply usiful and to he concid
sidered  only from  the standpoint of utility  The cultivated selfcid
consciousness which has  traversed  the  world  of selfalienated 
Spirit has  through  its  selfalienation  produced  the  Thing  as 
its own self therefore it still retains its own self iIi it and knows 
that  the  Thing lacks  selfsubsistence  that it  is  essentially  only 
abeingforanother  Of  to give complete expression  to  the relacid
tionshipie  to what alone constitutes the nature of the object 
here the Thing counts for it as something that exists  on  its  own 
acpoui it dclares sensecertainty to be absolute truth but this 
beingforseif is  itself  declared  to  be  a  moment  that  merely 
vanishes and passes  over into its opposite  into a  being  that is 
at the  disposal  of an  other 

  However at this stage knowledge of the Thing is  still 
not complete it must be known not only from  the standpoint 
of the immediacy of being and of determinateness  bu t also  as 
essence or innlrveing as Self This occurs in moral selfconsciousness 
This is  aware that its knowledge is  a knowledge of what is  absocid
lutely essential  it knows that being is simply and solely pure wilcid
ling and kQowing it is nothing else  but this willing and knowcid
ing  anything else  has  only  unessential  being ie  not  intrinsic 
being  only its  empty  husk  In  the  same  measure  that  moral 
selfconsciousness lets  determinate  being  go free  from  the Self  so 
too  in its  conception  of the  world  it takes  it back  again  into 
itself  Finally  as  conscience  it  is  no  longer  this  continual 
al ternationof exis tence being placed in the Self and vice  versa 
it knows  that its existence as  such is  this  pure certainty of itself 
The  objective  element  into  which  it  puts  itself forth  when 

C  DD  ABSOL UTE  KNOWING 

it  acts  IS  nothing  other  than  the  Selfs  pure  knowledge  of 
itself 

  These are  the  moments  of which  the  reconcipation  of 

Spirit with its own consciousness proper is composed by themcid
selves they are single and sepClrate and it is solely their spiritual 
unity that constitutes the power of this  reconciliation  The last 
of these moments is  however necessarily this  unity itself and 
as  is  evident it binds  them  all  into  itself  The  Spirit  that  in 
its existence is  certain of itself  has for  the element of existence 
nothing else  but this knowledge of itself when it declares  that 
what it does it does out of a  conviction of duty  this  utterance 
is the validating of its  action  Action is  the first  implicit sundering 
ofthesimpleunity of theN otion and the return ou t of this dividedcid
ness  This first movement changes round into the second since 
this element of recognition posits  itself  as  simple  knowledge of 
duty  in  antithesis  to  the  distinction  and  dichotomy  that  lie  in 
action as such and so constitutea stubborn actuality confrontcid
ing action But in forgiveness  we saw how  this obstinacy surcid
renders and renounces itself  Here  therefore actuality as  well 
as  immediate  existence  has  for  selfconsciousness  no  other  sigcid
nificance  than  that  of  being  a  pure  knowing  similarly 
as  determinate  existence  or  as  relation  what  is  selfopposed 
is  a  knowing  partly  of this  purely  individual  Self  partly of 
knowledge  as  universal  In  this  is  posited  at  the  same  time 
that the third moment the universality or essence  counts only as 
knowledge  for  each  of the two  sides  that  stand  over  against 
each other  and finally  these latter equally resolve  the empty 
antithesis  still  remaining  and  are  the  knowledge  of  
this  individual  Self which is  immediately a  pure  knowing  or  a 
universal 

  This reconciliation of consciousness with selfconsciouscid

ness  thus shows itself as  broughtabout from  two sides  on  one 
side in the religious Spirit and on the other side in consciouscid
ness itself as  such  The difference  between  them is  that in  the 
former  this  reconciliation  is  in  the  form  of beinginitself or 
implicit  being  and in the latter in  the  explicit  form  of being
Jorself  In our consideration of them they at first fall apart  In 
the other in which the shapes of consciousness came before  us 
consciousness reached the individual moments of those shapes 
and  their unification long before  ever religion  gave  its  object 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

the shape ofactual selfconsciousness The unification of the two 
sides  has not yet been exhibited it is  this  that closes  the series 
of the shapes of Spirit  for  in it Spirit  attains  to  a  knowledge 
ofitselfnot only as it is in itself or as possessing an absolute content 
nor only as  it isr itself as  a form  devoid of content  or as  the 
aspect of selfconsciousness but as it is both in essence and in  actucid
ality  or in  andforitself 

  This unification has however already occurred in princid

ciple and that too in religion in the return of picturethinking 
into selfconsciousness  but not according to  the  proper form 
for the religious aspect is  the aspect of the initself which stands 
over against the movement of selfconsciousness Consequently 
the unification belongs to  this  other aspect which  in  the concid
trast of the  two  sides  is  the  aspect of reflection  into self  and 
therefore the one that contains both its own self and its opposite 
and not only implicitly  or in a  universal sense  but explicitly  or 
in a  developed atld differentiated way  The content as  well as 
the  other  aspect  of selfconscious  Spirit  so  far  as  it  is  the 
other  aspect  has  been  exhibited  and  is  before  us  in  its  comcid
pleteness the unification that is still lacking is  the simple unity 
of the Notion  The Notion too  is  itself already present on  the 
sideofsdfconsciousness But as  it has come before  us  thus far 
ithas to be a particular shape of consciousness like all the other 
moments It is therefore that aspect of the shape of selfassured 
Spirit that abides within its Notion and was calledthe beautiful 
sour  The  beautiful soul  is  its  own  knowledge  of itself in  its 
pure transparent unitythe selfconsciousness tha t knows  this 
pure knowledge of pure  inwardness  as  Spirit  It is  not only  the 
intuition of the Divine but the Divines intuition of itself  Since 
this  Notion  holds  itself firmly  opposed  to  its  realization  it  is 
the onesided shape which we saw vaish into thin air but also 
positively  externalize  itself and  move  otlward  Through  this 
realization  this  objectless selfconsciousness  ceases  to  cling  to 
the determinateness  of the Notion as  against its fulfilment  its  self 
consciousness gains  the form of universality and what remains 
to itis its true Notion or the Notion that has attained its realizacid
tion it is  the Notion in its truth viz  in unity with its externalcid
ization it is  the knowing of pure knowledge not as  an abstract 
essence  such as  duty is  but of knowledge  as  an essential  being 
which is  this  knowedge  this  pure  selfconsciousness  which  is 

C  DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

therefore  at the same  time a  genuine  object  for  the  Notion  is 
the  Self that is  for  itself 

  This Notion fulfilled itself on one side in the selfassured 
Spirit that acted and on the other in religion in religion it won 
for consciousness  the absolute content as content or  in  the form 
of picturethinkzng  the  form  of otherness  for  consciousness  on 
the other hand in  the  prior shape  the form  is  that of the Self 
itself  for  it  contains  the  selfassured  Spirit  that  acts  the  Self 
accomplishes the life of absolute Spirit This shape is as we have 
seen that simple Notion which however surrenders its eternal 
essence  it is there  in the real world or it acts The selfsundering 
or steppingforth  into  existence  stems  from  the  purity  of the 
Notion for this is absolute abstraction or negativity Similarly 
the Notion gets the element of its actuality or the being it con 
tainsin pure knowledge itself for this is simple immediacy which 
is as much being and existence as it is essence the former negacid
tive thought the latter positive thought itself  Finally this excid
istence both as existence and as duty isjust as  much the refleccid
tedness  into  self out of pure  knowledgeor  the  s tate of evil 
This withdrawal into itself constitutes the antithesis of the Notion 
andis thus the emergence of the pure knowledge of the essence 
the knowing that does not act and is not actuaL Butthis emergence 
in the antithesis is  participation in it  the  purcknowledge  of 
essence has in  principle  renounced  its  simple  unity for it is  the 
selfsundering or the negativity which the Notion is so  far  as 
this selfs undering is  the process of becoming for itself  it is  evil 
so  far  as  it is  the  initself  it remains  good  Now  what  at first 
happens in principle is  at the same time explicitly for  conscious  
ness  and is  thus  double  it is  both for  consciousness  and  also  is 
its  beingJorself or  its  very  own  act  The  same  thing  that  is 
already posited  in principle  now  therefore  repeats  itself as  concid
sciousnesss knowledge of it and conscious act  Each in relation 
to  the  other lets  go  of the  independent  determinateness  with 
which  it  comes  forth  against  it This  lettinggo  is  the  same 
renunciation  of the  onesidedness of the  Notion  that  in  itself 
constituted the beginning but it is now its own act ofrenunciacid
tion Just as  the  Notion which  it renounces  is  its  own  Notion 
That initself Ie  the immediacy  of the beginning is  in truth 
as  negativity  no  less  mediated  what it is  in  truth  it now  also 
makes explicit  and the negative is  as  determinateness of each both 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

 

for the other and in itself selfsuspending One of the  two  parts 
of the  antithesis  is  the  disparity  between  the  Notions  being 
within  itself in  its  individuality  and  universality  the  other  the 
disparity  between  its  abstract  universality  and  the  Self  The 
former dies to its beingfor  self disowns itself  makes confession 
the  latter renounces  the  obstinacy of its  abstract  universality 
and in so doing dies  to its lifeless  Self and to  its  unmoved  unicid
versality  the  former  has  thus  completed  itself  through  the 
momen t of universali ty which is essence and the la ttel through 
the universality which is Self Through this movement of action 
Spirit has come on the scene as a  pure universality of knowing 
which  is  selfconsciousness  as  selfconsciousness  that  is  the 
simple unity of knowing  I t is  only  through  action  that Spirit 
is  in such a  way  that it is  really  there  that is  when  it raises  its 
existence into Thought and thereby into an absolute antithesis 
and returns out of this  antithesis in and through the antithesis 
itself 

  Thus what in religion was content or a form for  presentcid
ingan other  is  here the Selfs own act  the Notion requires  the 
content  to  be the  Selfs  own act  For  this  Notion  is  as  we see 
the knowledge  of the Selfs act within itself as  all  essentiality 
and  all  existence  the  knowledge  of this  subject  as  substance 
and of the substance as  this  knowledge  of its  act  Our own  act 
here has  been simply  to gather  together  the  separate  moments 
each of which in principle exhibits  the life  of Spirit in  its  encid
tirety and also to stick to the Notion in the form of the Notion 
the content of which would already have yielded itself in those 
moments and in  the form  of a  shape  of consciousness 

  This last shape of SpirittheSpirit which at the same 
time gives  its  complete and  true  content  the  form  of the  Sef 
and  thereby realizes  its  Notion  as  remaining  in  its  Notion  in 
this realizationthis is absolute knowing it is Spirit that knows 
itself in the shape of Spirit or a comprehensive  knowing  in terms 
of the N odon J  Truth is  not only  in  itself completely identical 
with certainty but it also  has  the  shape of selfcertainty  or it 
is  in its  existence  in  the  form  of selfknowledge  Truth  is  the 
content which in religion is still not identical with its certainty 
But this identity is  now a fact  in that the content has received 
the shape of the Self As a result that which is  the very essence 
viz  the  Notion  has  become  the  element of existence  or  has 

c  DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

become theform of objectivity for consciousness Spirit manifesting 
or appearing in consciousness in this element or what is  the same 
thing  produced  in  it by consciousness  is  Science 

  The nature  moments and  movement of this  knowing 
have then shown themselves  to  be such that this knowing is  a 
pure beingforself of selfconsciousness it is  tha t is  this and no 
other and which is  no  less  immediately a  mediated or supercid
seded universal I It has a content which it differentiates from itself 
for it is pure negativity or the dividing of itself it is consciousness 
This content is in its difference itself the I for it is  the movecid
ment of superseding itself or the same pure negativity that the 
I is  In  it  as  differentiated  the  is  reflected  into  itself  it 
is  only when the communes with itself in its  otherness  that 
the content is comprehended ie  in terms of the Notion  Stated 
more  specifically  this  content  is  nothing  else  than  the  very 
movement just spoken of for the contends Spirit that traverses 
its own self and does sofor itself as  Spirit by the fact that it has 
the  shape  of the  Notion in its  objectivity 

  But as regards the existence of this  Notion Science does 
not appear in Time and in the actual world  before  Spirit has 
attained to this consciousness about itself  As  Spirit thatknows 
what it is  it does not exist before  and nowhere at all  till after 
the completion of its  work of compelling its  imperfect  shape 
to  procure for  its  consciousness  the  shape of its  essence  and 
in  this  way  to  equate  its  sefconsciousness  with  its  consciousness 
Spirit thatis in and foritselfand differentiated into its moments 
is  a  knowing that islor itself a comprehension  in  general  that as 
such  substance  has  not  yet  reached  ie  substance  is  not  in 
its own self an absolute knowing 

  Now  in  actuality  the  substance  that  knows  exists 

earlier than its form or its Notiondetermined shape For subcid
stance is  the  as  yet  undeveloped  initself  or  the  Ground  and 
Notion in its still unmoved simpllcity and therefore the inwardcid
ness or the Selfof the Spirit that does not yet exist  What is  there 
exists as  the still undeveloped simple and immediate or as  the 
object of the picturethinking consciousness in genera Cognition 
because it is the spiritual consciousness for which what is in itself 
only is  in so far  as  it is  a  being for  the  Self and  a  being of the 
Selfor Notion has for  this  reason at first only a  meagre object 
in conlrast with which substance and the consciousness  of this 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

substance  are richer  The disclosure or revelation  which  sub 
stance has in this consciousness is in fact concealment for subcid
stance is still selfless being and what is  disclosed  to  it is  only  the 
certainty  of itselC At first  therefore  only  the  abstract  moments 
of su bstance  belong  to  selfconsciousness  but  since  these  as 
pure movements spontaneously impel themselves onward selfcid
consciousness enriches itself till  it has wrested from  consciouscid
ness the entire substance and has absorbed into itself the entire 
structure of the essentialities of substance And since this negacid
tive  attitude to objectivity isjust as much positive it is  a  positcid
ing it has produced them out of itself  and in so  doing has  at 
the same  time  restored  them for  consciousness  In the  Notion 
tha t knows itself as Notion the moments thus a ppear earlier than 
thefilled orfuljillulJ whole whose comingtobe is the movement 
of those moments In consciousness on the other hand the whole 
though uncomprehended is prior to the  moments  Tinle is  the 
Notion itself that is  there  and which presents itself to consciouscid
ness  as  empty  intuition  for  this  reason  Spirit  neessarily 
appears in Time and it appears in Time just so  long as  it has 
not grasped its  pure  Notion  ie  has  not annulled  Time  It is 
the outer  intuited pure Self which is  not grasped by the Self  the 
merely intuited Notion when thisJatter grasps itself it sets aside 
its  Timetorm  comprehends  this  intuiting  and  is  a  comprecid
hended and comprehending intuiting Time therefore appears 
as  the destiny and necessity  of Spirit that is  not yet  complete 
within  itself  the  necessity  to  enrich  the  share  which  selfconcid
sciousness has in consciousness  to set in  motion  the  immediacy 
oj the  initselj  which is  the form  in which substance is  present 
in  consciousness  or conversely  to  realize  and  reveal  what  is 
at first only inward the initsefbeing taken as what is  inward 
ie  to  vindicate it for  Spirits  certainty of itself 

  For  tbis  reqson  it  must be  said  that  nothing  is  known 
that is  not  in  experience  or  as  it is  also  expressed  tht  is  not 
felt to  be  true  not given as  an inwardly  revealed eternal verity  as 
something sacred thatis believed  or whatever other expressions 
have been used  For experience is just this  that the contentcid
which  is  Spiritis in  itself substance  and  therefore  an  obJect 
of consciousness  But this substance which is  Spirit is  the process 
in which Spirit becomes  what it isinitsclj  and it is  only as  this 
proess ofreftecting itselfinto itself that it is in itself truly Spirit 

C  DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

I t is in itself the movement which is  cognitionthe transformcid
ing of that initselfinto that which islor itself  of Substance into 
Subject of the object of consciousness  into an object of selfconcid
sciousness  ie  into  an  object  that  is  just  as  much  superseded 
or into the Notion  The movement is  the circle that returns into 
itself  the circle  that presupposes  its  beginning and  reaches  it 
only  at  the  end  Hence  so  far  as  Spirit  is  necessarily  this 
immanent  differentiatitm  its  intuited  whole  appears  over 
against its simple selfconsciousness and since then the former 
is what is differentiated it is differentiated into its intuited pure 
Notion into  Time and into the content or into the initself Subcid
stance is  charged as  Subject with the at first  only  inward necescid
sity of setting forth within itselfwhat it is in itself  of exhibiting 
itself as Spirit Only when the objective presentation is complete 
is it at the same time the reflection of substance or the process 
in which substance becomes Self Consequently until Spirit has 
completed itself in itself  until it has  completed itself as  worldcid
Spirit it cnnot reach its consummation as selfconscious Spirit 
Therefore  the  content  of religion  proclaims  earlier  in  time 
than does  Science  what  Spirit  is  but only  Science is  its  true 
knowledge of itself 

  The movement of carrying forward the form of its self  
knowledge  is  the labour which  itaccomplishes as  actual  Hiscid
tory  The religious  community so far asit is  at first  the  subcid
stance  of absolute  Spirit  is  the  uncultivated  consciousness 
whose  existence  is  all  the  harsher  and  more  barbarous  the 
deeper its inner Spirit is and the deeper its Spirit is  the harder 
the task  that its torpid Self has with its  essence  with the alien 
content ot Its  consciousness  Not  until  consciousness  has  given 
up hope of overcomingthat alienation in an external Le alien 
manner does  it  turn  to  itself  because  the  overcoming of that 
alienation is  the  return into selfconsciousness  not  until  then 
does it turn to its own present world and discover it as  its propcid
erty thus taking the first step towards coming down out of the 
intellectual world or rather towards quickening the abstract elecid
ment of that world with  the actual Self  Through Observation 
it finds  on  the  one  hand  existence  in  the shape  of Thought 
and comprehends it and conversely in its thinking it comprecid
hends existence When to begin with it has  thus expressed the 
immediate  unity  of Thought  and  Being  the  unity  of abstract 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

essence and the Self abstractly and when it has expressed the 
primal  Light  in  a  purer  form  viz  as  unity  of extension  and 
beingfor extension  is  the  simple  unity  which  more  nearly 
resembles  pure  thought  than light doesand in so  doing  has 
revived  in  thougJtt  the  Substance  of the  Orient  Spirit  at  once 
recoils in horror from the abstract unity from  this selfless subcid
stantiality and against it affirms  individuality  But only  after 
it has  externalized  this  individuality in  the  sphere  of culture 
thereby giving it an existence  and establishing it  throughout 
the  whole  of existenceonly  after  Spirit  has  arrived  at  the 
thought of utility and in its absolute freedom has grasped existcid
ence as its will only then does  it turn the thought of its  inmost 
dephs outwards and enunciate essence as I   I But this I  
I is  the movement which reflects itselfinto itself for since this 
identity  being absolute negativity  is  absolute  difference  the 
self  identity of the  I stands  over against  this  pure  difference 
which as pure and at the same time objective to  the selfknowcid
ing Self has  to beexpressed as Time So that just as previously 
essence was declared to bethe unity of Thought and Extension 
it would now have to be grasped as  the  unity of Thought and 
Time But the difference left to itself unresting and  unhalting 
Time  collapses  rather within itself  it is  the  objective  repose 
of extension  while extension is  pure identity with  itself  the  I 
In other words  the  I is  not  merely  the  Self  but  the  identity 
of the Self with itself but this identity is complete artd immediate 
oneness with Self or this Subject is just as  much  Substance  Subcid
stance just by  itself  would be  intuition devoid of content  or 
the intuition of a content which l  as determinate would be only 
accidental and would lack necessity  Substance would pass for 
the Absolute only in so far as it was thought or intuited as absocid
lute unity  and all content would  as  regards  its diversity  have 
to fall outside of it into Reflection and Reflection does not percid
tain  to  Substance  because  Substance  would  not  be  Subject 
would not be grasped as reflecting on itself and reflecting itself 
into itself  would  not  be  grasped  as  Spirit  If a  content were 
to  be spoken of anyway  it  would  on  the  one  hand  only  be 
spoken of in order to cas tit in to the empty abyss of the Absol ute 
and on the other it would be  a  content picked up in external 
fashion from senseperception Knowledge would seem to have 
come by things by wha t is different from itself and by the dif

C  DO  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

 
ference of a variety of things without comprehending how and 
whence  they came 

  Spirit  however  has  shown  itself  to  us  to  be  neither 

merely  the  withdrawal  of selfconsciousness  into  its  pure  incid
wardness nor the  mere submergence of selfconsciousness into 
substance and the nonbeing of its moment of difference but 
Spirit is  this  movement  of the  Self which  empties  itself of itself 
and sinks itselfinto its substance and also as Subject has gone 
out of that substance into itself  making the substance into an 
object and a content at the same time as it cancels this difference 
between  objectivity  and  content  That  first  reflection  out  of 
immediacy is  the Subjects differentiation of itself from  its subcid
stance or the Notions separation ofiteffrom itself  the withcid
drawal into itself and the  becoming of the  pure  I Since  this 
difference is  the pure act of I   I the Notion is  the necessity 
and the uprising of existence  which has substance for its essence 
and subsists on its own account But this subsistence of existence 
onits own account is the Notion posited indeterminateness and 
is thus also its immanent movement that of going down into the 
simple substance which is  Subject only as  this  negativity and 
movement  The has neither to  ding to itself in  the form  of 
selfconsciousness as against the form of substantiality and objeccid
tivity  as  if it were afraid  of theexternalization of itself  the 
power  of Spirit  lies  rather  in  remaining  the  selfsame  Spirit 
in  its  externalization  and  as  that which  is  both  in  itself and 
for 
less  merely  a 
moment than its  initself nor is  Spirit a  tertium  quid that casts 
the differences back into the abyss of the Absolute and declares 
that therein  they are all  the same on  the  contrary  knowing 
is  this seeming inactivity which merely contemplates how what 
is differentiated spontaneously moves in its own self and returns 
in to  its  unity 

in  making  its  beingforself  no 

itself 

  In this knowing  then Spirit has concluded the  movecid

ment in which it has shaped itself in so far as  this shaping was 
burdened with the difference of consciousness ie of the latter 
from its object a difference now overcome Spirit has won the 
pure element of its  existence  the  Notion  The content in accid
cordance with the freedom  of its being  is  the selfalienating Self 
or the immediate unity of selfknowledge The pure movement 
of this  alienation considered in connection  with  the  content 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

constitutes the necessity  of the content The distinct content as 
determinate  is  in  relation is  not  in itself it is  its  own  restless 
process of superseding itself or negativity  therefore  negativity 
or  diversity  like  free  being  is  also  the  Self  and  in  this  selfcid
likeformin which existence is immediately thought the content 
is  the Notion  Spirit therefore having won the Notion displays 
its existence and movement in this ether of its life and is  Science 
In this  the moments of its  movement no longer exhibit  themcid
selves as specific shapes oj consciousness butsince consciousnesss 
difference has returned into the Selfas specific  Notions  and as 
their organic selfgrounded movement Whereas in the phenocid
menology of Spirit each moment is  the difference of knowledge 
and  Truth  and  is  the  movement  in  which  that  difference  is 
cancelled Science on the other hand does  not con tain this dif 
ference  and  the  cancelling  of it  On  the  contrary  since  the 
momenthas the form of the Notion it unites the objective form 
of Truth and of the knowing Self in an immediate unity  The 
moment does not appear as this movement of passing back and 
forth  from  consciousness  or  picturethinking  into  selfconcid
sciousnessand  conversely  on  the  contrary  its  pure  shape 
freed from its appearnce in consciousness the pure Notion and 
its onward movement depends solely on its pure determinateness 
Conversely  to  each  abstract  moment  of Science  corresponds 
a shape of manifest Spirit as such Just as Spirit in its existence 
is  not richer than Science so  too it is  not poorer either in concid
tent To know the pure Notions of Science in this form of shapes 
of consciousness constitutes the side of their reality  in accordcid
ance with which their essence  the Notion which  is  posited in 
them  in  its  simple  mediation  as  thinking  breaks  asunder  the 
moments  of this  mediation  and  exhibits  itself in  accordance 
with  the  inner antithesis 

  Science contains within itself this  necessity  of externacid

lizing the form  of the  Notion  and  it contains  the  passage  of 
the  Notion into  consciousness  For  the selfknowing  Spirit just 
because itgraspsits Notion is  the immediateidentity with itself 
which in its difference is  the certainty  oj immediacy  or senseconcid
sciousnessthe  beginning from  which we  started  This  release 
of itself from  the  form  of its  Self is  the  supreme  freedom  and 
assurance  of its  selfknowledge 

  Yet this externalization is  still incomplete it expresses 

C  DD  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

 
the connection of its  selfcertainty with  the object which just 
because it is  thus connected has  not yet won its complete free 
dom Theself  knowing Spirit knows not only itself but also  the 
negative of itself  or its  limit  to  know  ones  limit  is  to  know 
how to sacrifice oneself  This sacrifice  is  the  externalization  in 
which Spirit displays  the  process  of its  becoming Spirit in  the 
form ofjree contingent happening  intuiting its  pure Self as  Time 
outside of it and equally its Being as Space This last becoming 
of Spirit Nature  is its living immediate Becoming Nature  the 
externalized  Spirit is  in  its  existence  nothing but this  eternal 
externaHzation  of  its  continuing  existence  and  the  movement 
which  reinstates  the Subject 

  But the other side of its Becoming History is a conscious 
selfmmediating  processSpirit emptied  out into Time  but  this 
externalization  this  kenosis  is  equally  an  externalization  of 
itself  the  negative  is  the  negative  of  itself  This  Becoming 
presents aslowmoving succession of Spirits a gallery of images 
each of which  endowed with all the riches of Spirit moves thus 
slowly Just  because  the  Self has  to  penetrate  and  digest  this 
en tire wealth of its substance  As  its fulfilment  consists  in  per 
fectlyknowing what it is in knowing its substance this knowing 
is itswithdrawal into itseifin which it abandons its outer existence 
and  gives  its  existential  shape  over  to  recollection  Thus 
a bs orb ed in itself it is sunk in the nigh t of its seWconsciousness 
but in that night its vanished outer existence is preserved and 
this transformed existencethe former one but now reborn of 
the Spirits knowledgeis the new existence a  new world and 
a  new shape of Spirit  In the  immediacy of this  new existence 
the  Spirit has  to  startafresh  to  bring itself to  maturity  as  if 
for  it  all  tha t  preceded were  lost  and it had  learned  nothing 
from  the experience of the earlier Spirits  But recollection the 
inwatdizing or that experience has preserved it and is  the inner 
being  and  in  fact  the  higher  form  of  the  substance  So 
although this Spirit starts afresh  and apparently from  its  own 
resources to bring itself to maturity it is none the less on a higher 
level that it starts  The realm of Spirits which is  formed ih  this 
wa y in the outer world consti tu tes a succession in Time in which 
one Spirit relieved another of its charge and each took  over the 
empire  of the  world  from  its  predecessor  Their  goal  is  the 
revelation of the depth of Spirit  and  this  is  the  absolute  Notion 

ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

 

This revelation is  therefore  the  raisingup of its  depth  or its 
extension the negativity of this withdrawn a negativity which 
is its externalization or its substance j  and this  revelation is  also 
the Notions Time in  that this  externalization is  in its  own self 
externalized  and just as  it  is  in  its  extension  so  it  is  equally

ANALYSIS  OF  THE  TEXT 

PREFACE 

I  It is impossible to begin a philosophical work with a clear statecid

ment of the kind of view itpes to establish or of its relation to what 
others have written For philosophy aims at a  universality which will 
embrace and sum  up particulars and cannot be expressed  till  those 
particulars  have  been gone  through  and  have  yielded  up  the  unicid
versality in question  It cannot be  anatomized in  advance  without 
seeing how  its  parts function  in  the  whole 

  To state  the  relation  of a  philosophical  work  to  others  is  also 
misleading in that it suggests that previous works were faseand have 
now  been Gancelled  out in  truth  But  philosophical  systems  do  not 
replace aJseloog by truth  they  represent the ever clearer developcid
meQt of truth which is  as  much preent in earlier forms  as  in later 
and which  is  only complete  in  a  total  development wbich  includes 
all earlier stages 

  A stltment of philosophical aims and results is only legitimate 
if it  is  sen as  being  initial  and  superficial  and  is  not  regarded  as 
reveaIiQ tle  essenc  of the  matter in hand  For  this  essence  is  not 
exhautedpy aims  but by  the  wy in  which  they  are  carried  out 
I t is  not concerned with mere results but with the manner in  which 
they emerge To state results without saying how one arrives at them 
is  to  present tbe  corpse  of a  system  wbereasmerely  to  differentiate 
a system  from  others is  to  remain  resolutely on its fringes 

  General principles and points of view belong only to the begin 
nings  of the  life  of thought  Once  ones  mind  has  become  deeply 
immerseq n its subjectmatter they will be relegated  to urfacetalk 

  Philosqphical truth can only exist in the form ora fullyworkedcid

out scientific systern Philosophy mustsbow up the inner necessity that 
drives knowledge towards Science and it mustitselfembody this drive 
when  the  appropriate  moment arrives 

  The  trlJe  shape  of trllth  is  conceptual  and  notional  This  can 
at present only be asserted as  a  counter to  views  like  those  of Jacobi 
StudiesinSpinpza  Novalis Schlegel etc which maicedirect uncid
reasoning  intuidon  Anschauung  and  feeling  and  central  in  philccid
sophy  and  the very  being of the  Absolute  itself 

  These latter views  arise from  the  disillusioned  desire  to  return 
to  the peace and security of unquestioning faith which philosophical 
thinking has rudely shattered They demand a suppression of thought

distinctions  not  their further  clarification  They  aim  at  edification 
and enthusiasm  rather  than cool  insight 
B  Such views are an attempt to return to the heavendirected gaze 
of earlier eras of though t which has been succeeded by a gaze directed 
only to empirical detail  which  now stultifies  and starves  the  Spirit 
  True Science cannot however be sa tisfied to see all detail vanish 

in  an insubstantial  edifying  mist 

  The  complacency  which  spurns  as  finite  the  exactly  defined 
concepts and necessary connections of Science is not above but below 
the level of Science Its wouldbe profundities are empty its sweeping 
assertions  superficial  its  prophetic  pronouncements  arbitrary  and 
superficial 

 I  Our own  time  is  obviously  ripe  for  a  major  intellectual  and 
spiritual advance This has been in the womb  for  a  long time  and 
is now about to achieve birth Its birthpangs are felt in a widespread 
sense of disillusion and frivolity and in the vague foreboding of somecid
thing unknown at hand 

  A new scientific spirit is at first only present in general notional 
germ  It is  the  product of an extensive  laborious  transformation  of 
previous cultunil forms  and their resumption into a  new simplicity 
It must  to  be fully  actual  redevelop these forms  out of thissirnple 
unity 

  Science  in its  new  notional form  asyet ill  worked  out and 
ill connected with  the  rich  detail  of past  thinkingseems to  be  the 
obscure possession of an esoteric sect To be generally intelligible and 
exoteric it must connect all this past detail with its new position  To 
understand is  to  make familiar  material  ones  own  by  incorporating 
it in  a  new scientific structure 

  When Science first emerges it has on the one hand a  tendency 
to stress simple intuitive rationality and a  relation  to what is  divine 
btlt also on the other hand to develop this  insight into an  organized 
wealth of detail  The second  tendency rna y  be held  in check  by the 
first  but continues  with justificatIon  to  demand satisfaction 

  The tendency towards detail may try toatisfy itself by merely 
running through familiarly organized material adding to  this  much 
that is  extraordinary and curious  and  then  mechanically  applying 
the same absolute idea to all such detail without the least modificacid
tion to suit special cases  Ths is  a  monotonous formalism applicable 
only to  readymade  differences 

  The false  absolutism just sketched fails  to  develop  difference 
and detail out of itself  but thinks it has done its  task when it has said 
of anything specific  that it is  not  to  be  found  in  the  Absolute  since 
there we have only the Absolutes identity with self Such an Absolute 
is  the  night in  which every cow  is  black  As  opposed  to such  a  false 

PREFACE  

 

absolutism it will  be helpful  to  give  a  sketch  of a  true one  Aimed 
at Schelling  but obviously applying  to  others  as  well 

  In my view which the full  exposition of my system alone can 
justify  the  true  Absolute  must not  merely  be  thought  of as  a  Sub 
stance  ie  something immediately  there  whether this  be  a  knower 
or something known  It must be  thought of as  a  Subject  We  think 
in  terms of Substance  if we  think  in  terms  of undifferentiated  unicid
versality whether this  be that of what merely is  or of what merely 
thinks  or  of  what  it  la  Schelling  combines  both  in  a  single 
intellectual intuition 

  True Substance is a being that truly is Subject ie which only is 
itself in so far as it alienates itself from  itself  and is  then able to posit 
itself in and  through what is  thus alien  I t  cannot exist as  a  simple 
positive startingpoint but only as part of a selfdeparting selfreturncid
ing  movement  which  both  negates  itself in  indifferent  external 
otherness and then reasserts itself as the negation of aU such otherness 

  The life  and seWknowledge of the Absolute  may  well  be  decid

scribed as that of the divine Love disporting itselfwith itself but such 
an image readily  becomes  insipid  or sinks  into  edification  since  it 
fils  to emphasize theseriousness  the anguish and the patient effort 
involved in thus negating the negation  The essence of the Absolute 
cannot be separatedfrom its execution norits form from the full concid
tent of its carryingout 

  The true Absolute can only be seen as  the whole of a selfrealizcid

ing act or process  and is  also  the  result  or outcome of such  an  act 
or process  What is  present at its  beginning can only be emptily unicid
versal and can only achieve specific content through connection with 
what appears  to  be other than itself  but what  can  then  be  seen  to 
be not really  other 

  There is  a  horror of mediate connection which  stems  from  a 
misunderstandingoftherole of mediation in absolute knowledge For 
mediation is  merely the selfnegation and the negation of this  negacid
tion  involved in  the  selfidentification  of the  Subject  The Subject 
only becomes an immediate unity  through the denial of its  mediate 
connection  with something else  Reflection  or  the  going from  one 
thing to another should not be abhorred it is  essential to the return 
tosef which annuls it 

 

  What has been said amounts to saying that Reason is purposive 
activity  Exterpal  purpose  has  rightly  been  banished  from  natural 
philosophy but not so the self  moving purposiveness which is  indistcid
inguishable from  subjectivity  For in purpose the result or outcome 
is  one with  its  moving cause  which  in  departing from self realizes 
self and in which even the process of departing from self is a fulfilment 
of self 

ANALYSIS 

  Philosophical  sentences  eg  God  is  the  moral  order  of the 
world  illustrate the  nature of the Absolute  For while  they  appear 
to have fixed subjects to which predicates accrue externally these subcid
jects  merely anticipate  what is  to  be  predicated  of them  and  only 
acquire  concrete  significance  when  the  predication  is  completed 
Predications analytically anticipated in the meaning of their subjects 
make  predication quite vacuous 

  Philosophical knowledge is essentially systematic and a  philo 
sophical first principle therefore at once refutes itself by being merely 
a first principle Being merely universal merely initial its  further de 
velopment is  in a sense ks  own  refutation  the clear exhibition of its 
merely initial character 

  That philosophical  truth  is  necessarily  systematic  that Subcid

stance must be Subject can be expressed by saying that the Absolute 
is  essentially  Spirit  both  in  and  for  itself  It is  at first  only  in  and 
for  itself to  philosophical reflection  and is  then spiritual Substance 
or Spiri tin itself It must become in itselfor itself must come to know 
Spirit and itselfasSpirit ie must become its own object both immecid
diately and reflectively Spirit thus fully selfconscious is Science ie 
Spirit fully  Qonstituted for  itself in its  own  element 
 
Q   To know itsefand be at home with itselfinwhat is absolutely 
other than itselfis the  true Aether of Science But for  the ordinary 
consciousness  which always opposes  itself to  its objects life  in  such 
an Aether seems  topsyturvy  and  unreal  The  thinking  spirit  must 
gradually accustom itself to such  topsyturvy unreality 

  The genesis of Science is the  theme of the  Phenomenology of 
Spirit  This genesis starts from  Spirit immediate or spiritless  Spirit 
ie from the consciousness of senseand must tread a long road before 
it can become true Science can give  birth to its  true concept or elecid
ment  Such  a  genesis will  not be a  fancied  illumination of the  road 
to science nor yet an actual founding of science nor yet a  pistolshot 
of illumination aiming straight at absolute knowledge 

  The task  of proceeding from  the  uncultured  to  the knowing 

mind  is  really  performed  by  the  universal  individual  ie  selfconcid
scious Spirit as such The particular individual is  merely a onesided 
partial expression  of this  Spirit an expression  in  which  one  trait  is 
emphatic and the rest underscored  The particular individual must 
howver run through and repossess itself of all the phases of the unicid
versal individlals past development They will  now  be seen  as  part 
of the environing scene not req uiTing the deep research that was precid
viously  demanded 

  It is impossible to state the scientific outcome of aU  this cultural 
development  without  running  through  it  patiently  stage  by  stage 
Each stage on the route has  been  necessary  and  has  incarnated the 

PREFACE  

 
sense  of the  whole  movement in  one  of its  special  phases  But such 
a runningthrough is  eased and abbreviated by the reduction of past 
stages  to  explicit thoughts from  being merely  implicit existences 

  Past stages have lost  the immediacy of existence  but this  loss 
of existence is  only a  first negation which still retains the immediacy 
of the  mere  presentation  the  idea  that is  familiar  and  has  as  such 
been set aside This first negation must itself be negated and the famcid
iliar idea brought back into the purview of the thinking self 

  What is merely familiar is not as such properly known To build 
upon fammar concepts of subjectivity objectivity God Nature etc 
without allowing these ideas to develop is  and remains irremediably 
superficial 

  The analysis of an idea is  the removal ofits familiarity  its  recid
duction to elements that are the true possessions of the  thinking self 
In such  reduction  the  idea  itself changes  and  renders  itself unreal 
The force which effects analysisis that of the Understanding the most 
remarkable  and  absolute  of powers  the power  of the  thinking  self 
and  also  of death  I t  is  above  all  marvellous  that  this  thinking  self 
should be able to isolate  and  to  look  at apart  what  can  only  exist 
as an aspect ormoment in a living whole Thinking Spirit can how 
ever  only grasp such a  whole  by first  tearing  it into  parts  each  of 
which it must look at separately for a while before putting them back 
in the whole  The thinking self must destroy an immediate  existent 
unity in order to  arrive  at a  unity which includes  mediation and is 
in  fac t media tion  itself 
    Ancient  thought differs from  ours in  that it  built  directly  on 
the natural consciousness and reached out to  the  universal from  it 
whereas our thought finds the universal lying ready to hand in hard 
fixed form which it then has to revitalize and restore  to  fluidity  So 
vitalized fixed ideas become selfmoving notions spiritual essentialicid
ties 

  Such a movement of pure essentialities is Science as such whose 
con ten t  is  nothing  but  their  necessary  expansion  into  an  organic 
whole The notion of Science does not arise out of contingent philo socid
phizing on these or those themes relations or common ideas nor from 
logical  manipulations  of these  or  those  definite  thoughts  but from 
the roundingitselfout of the selfmoving concept into  cosmic  comcid
pleteness 

  The exposition to be given in the present work is  therefore the 

first part of Science in  that Spirits first existence is merely the begincid
ning in which it has not yet returned  to self  Existential  immediacy 
distinguishes this part of the system  This leads us on to comment on 
certain fixed  ideas  which occur in this  context

ANALYSIS 

braces  two  opposed  factors  the  element  of knowledge  and  that  of 
objectivity  Together  these  constitte the  experience  of Spirit  and 
th ere is no thing in the  bjec ti ve Subs tance given in experience but w ha t 
falls within such experience Spirit however itself underlies the objec 
tivity which at first confron ts it as alien and which is  then repossessed 
and seen  as  its  own 

  The disparity between the self and  the  objective Substance is 
the  void which  inspires  their  movement  towards  one another  The 
ancients rightly  made  the  void  a  principle of motion  The disparity 
between self and object is at once an inadequacy of the selfin under 
standing the object and an inadequacy of the object to  itself  When 
the  object  is  fully  itself  ie  fully  revealed  the  subjectobject  discid
tinction vanishes  and  Phenomenology yields  place  to  Logic 

  There  is  a  temptation  to  think  that  since  the  standpoint  of 
Phenomenology  is  superseded as  false  in  the  standpoint of Logic  it 
would  have  been  better  to  have  dispensed  with  it  and  have  gone 
straight to  Logic This argues a false  view of truth and of its  relation 
to  what is  false 

  Falsehood is not simply the slag or dross which must be rejected 
to  arrive at truth itis the  unshaped metal which must be  reshaped 
and refined into truth  and  which is  necessarily present in  the  final 
shape of such truth 

  The philosophical dogmatist thinks we  can  proounce  defini 
tively on a  philosophical issue  as  we  can  pronounce  on  the  date  of 
Caesars birth or on the equality of the square on a  triangleS  hypocid
ten use  to the  two  sq uares  on its  other two sides 

  The  truths  of history  to  the  extent that they  are  contingent 
and concern particular existents  are  indeed  naked  matters  of fact 
which  nothing  renders  necessary  Even  here  however  there  are 
grounds for  and against  so  that error becomes  part of truth 

  Mathematical  truths  are  not  thought  to  be  known  unless 
proved  true  Their demonstrations  are  not  however  kept as  parts 
of what they prove but are only our subjective means  towards knowcid
ing the latter In philosophy however consequences always form part 
of the essence made manifest in them which returns to  itself in  such 
expressions 

  Mathematical  insights  employing  constructions  and  proofs 
have  to  that extent always  something false  about  them  We  depart 
from the triangle in incorporating its parts into other figures  and we 
only come  back  to  it in  the  end 

  Mathematical knowledge is defective in that lines of proof and 
constructions have to be blindly tried out till we hit on one that leads 
to  the desired conclusion  They are not consequences of the notional 
content of the  theorem  to  be established 

PREFACE  

 

  Mathematics may plume itself on its selfevidence but this selfcid
evidence rests  on the  poverty of its  aim  and  the  defectivenes of its 
material in which philosophy should be ashamed to follow it Mathecid
matics only seeks to establish quantitative relations which belong excid
clusively to the surface of things  I ts rna terials are space and the unit an 
empty lifeless repetitive element set forth in fixed dead propositions 
linked  together only by equational identities  and  never progressing 
through opposition to some qualitatively different outcome  The incid
commensurability of the different dimensions which for mathematics 
constitutes  a  problem  is  a  luminous  necessity  to  the  philosopher 
  Mathematics is  wholly  unsuccessful  in  its  treatment of time 
which it does not see as standing in a relation of necessary opposition 
and  complementarity  to  space  Its  proofs  of  the  equalization  of 
moments in the lever and of the relations of time and space in gravitacid
tion  are  pitifully  empirical  Time  with  its  essential  living  selfdifcid
ferentiatiQn  is  the  very  Notion  present  in  actual  existence  The 
notionless  quantities  and  equations  of mathematics  are  unable  to 
capture its  essence 

  Philosophy does not move in the inert abstract unreal medium 
of  mathematics  but  in  an  actual  living  progression  of  distinct 
notional  phases  some of which  negate  what  went  before  and  are 
themselves negated in what follows  but are all necessary steps in  the 
progression  and  are recalled  in  its  final  conclusion  Philosophical 
truth is like a Bacchanalian riot where the  drunken participants fall 
down as  they try to stand up but it is  also like the enlaced final sleep 
in which all  have  collapsed  on  to  the floor 

  The method of philosophy must be set forth  by Logic  and is 
in fact Logic itself It is not the method of rna thema tics with its definicid
tions  axioms  theorems  proofs  grounds pro  and contra  etc  which 
deals externally with its materials and does  not seek to develop their 
inner  content  Mathematical  methods  are  suited  to  their  abstract 
materials  and  to  the  fixed  identities  of concrete  sensuous  things 
which  do not change as  we  consider  them 

  But if phHosophysteers clear of the loose methods of ordinary 
argument and the exact methods of mathematics  it must nottherefore 
let itself sink back into prophetic divinations and enthusiasms which 
are not scientific  at aU 

  Kant has brough t back in to philosophy the dialectical triplicity 
which is the essential form of Science But neither he nor his successors 
have been able to give it life  They have treated it as an inert schema 
and have applied it to the  most heterogeneous  materials sometimes 
grossly empirical sometimes  categorial and notional  Such applicacid
tions are as void of deep sense as are the categoryheadings ot ordinary 
chatter 

 

ANALYSIS 

  Such unthinking application of the same schema  to quite  difcid
ferent  materials is  a  pure formalism  though it may call itself a  concid
struction I t makes use throughou t of a wild series of analogical iden ticid
fications  The  Understanding is  linked  to  electricity  the  animal  to 
nitrogen andso on There is an appearance of conceptual connection 
where none is really present The procedure resembles that of a  poor 
painter who depicts everything in two colours or worse still  in one 
  It is  however  only  because dialectical  triplicity  is  felt  to  be 
the  essential  form  of Science  that it  is  thus  devitalized  and  abused 
  True Science is nothing but the selfdevelopment of the Notion 

which first confronts its ownsimple universality with a specific objeccid
tive  other  then  takes  back  the  sense  of that other into  its  own simcid
plicity  thereby  becoming  more  determinate  The  schematizing 
Understanding merely catalogues and tables  the stages  of such selfcid
development without knowing what they  amount  to  nor the  prin
ciple  of their growth 

 

  Every qualitative nuance of being has its  own abstracted selfcid

identity  which  is  one  with  the  abstract  selfidentity  of a  distinct 
thought  This  selfidentical  qualitative  nuance  necessarily  brings 
about its  own dissolution  and  becomes  a  mere  moment  in  a  wider 
whole But this dissolution is notbroughtabout by some alien process 
of reflection  but is cunningly contrived by theobjectivecontent itself 
which  to  preserve itself must move  beyond itself  Th thought  that 
sees  this  does  not  progress  bya  retreat  into  subjectivity  but  by 
immersing itself in  its  objeces own development 

  The abstractive Understanding is  not only  an  aspect  of selfcid
conscious subjectivity but also ofexistent being Existence means discid
tinctionin quali ty this is the Understanding of exis tenee wha t Anax 
agoras called  its  Nous  and  what  later  thinkers  raised  to  the  status 
of an Eidos or Idea or sort But such a selfidentical distinct sort incid
volves its own dissolution it may seem to be destroyed  by alien  viocid
lence  but  is  in  fact  destroyed  by  the  negation  the  reference  to 
another which  it bears within  itself  In such  becoming  the  Undercid
standingaspect of being passes  over into its  Reason 

  The being of anything is  one with its  Notion and  this  Notion 

is at once the necessity of its  rhythmic development and the speculacid
tive concept which enables us  to know it  It is  not necessary to apply 
speculative categories  to  what concretely  is  since  the latter already 
embodies such  categories in itself 

  The scientific method ofspeculative philosophy will show itself 
to  be at once  determined  by the  contents  it studies  and  by  its  own 
inherent rhythms Ifit is described as we havejust described it resistcid
ance will be aroused from the standpoint both of sound common sense 
and of mystical insight This is the standard response to what seems an 

PREFACE  

  

alien dogma  men prefer to  be revolutionary in  their own time and 
manner 

  To  think  in  pure  Notions  eg  selfidentity  beinginitself 
beingforelf is tiresome and difficult both to the thought that prefers 
to  think  in  pictures  in  which  what  is  universal  is  not  clearly 
abstracted and to merely argumentative thought which does not imcid
merse  itself in  its  thoughtcontent at all  but satisfies  its  vanity  by 
pronouncing upon  it  rather  than by  allowing  it  to  develop 

  Argumentative thinking delights in refuting a conceptual concid

tent and reducing it  to  nothing  Such  negative  reflection  is  as  vain 
and empty as  the content it refutes It is  quite different from  the concid
structive negation which  always  has  a  positive outcome 

  Argumentative thinking connects the content it thinks of with 

its own self as judging Subject The determina tion of subject by predicid
cate  seems  to  it  to  be  its  own  free  doing  But  the  thought  which 
achieves grasp ofits subject only does so when its round of predication 
is  complete  It discovers  its  subject  only  in  being forced  to  enlarge 
its predications and not in its original reference But picturethought 
concerned only with points of reference and with what is  accidental 
resents  having to  revise its  content as  it goes  along  The  revision  of 
the  logical subject however  means  the  emergence  of the  thinking 
Subject which finds itself in developing the content of the logical subcid
ject  through  various  predications  and  not  in  some  arbitrary 
referencepoint of which arbitrary predications are made  Paragraph 
very difficult  owing to  identificationindistinction  of the  conscious 
with  the logicogrammatical subject 

 I  The conflict we have here is  that of the superficial view of the 
proposition of judgement which  treats it as an txternal  connection 
of independently  significant  elements  and  of the  speculative view 
which  sees  it  as  the  selfdevelopment  through  complementary  dif 
ferences  of a single significant content 

  It is  hard for  an  argumentative  thinker  to  realize  that  until 
he has decided what has to be said ofa given logical subject eg  God 
in his relation to being he is not truly concerning himself with subject 
of reference  nor with  any subject at aU 

  From this springs the objection to philosophical statements that 
they have to be read over many times before they can be understood 
A comfortable enlargement of a familiar subject by the mere addiion 
of predicates has  ceased  to  be possible 

  To mix argumentative thinking with speculative dialectic can 
never  succeed  since  the  fixed  points  of reference  necessary  for  the 
former  are lacking in  the latter 

  Speculative dialectic does  not merely dispense  with  the  fixed 
distinctions of argumentative  thought in  some  high  flight  of insight 

ANALYSIS 

It shows  them  breaking down as  it reflects  on  the  intrinsic sense  of 
propositions 

  Speculative dialectic must itselfbe expounded in propositions 

and this might seem to expose it to the same objections as argumentacid
tive  thought  and  to  open  the way  to  a  critique of speculation  But 
the propositional form is a mere shell in speculation since its predicacid
tions are not meant to be externally added to an already fixed subject 
of reference  For this  reason names like  God with a  conventionally 
fixed  content are best avoided in  philosophy 

  I t  is  not  thought  necessary  to  have  a  preliminary  training 
before  one  philosophizes  ordinary information  skills  methods  are 
thought sufficient  But since nothing can  be  taken for  granted  until 
tested by philosophy philosophy involves its own skills and standards 
which have to  be learnt and practised 

  Thought incapable of considering abstract propositions or their 
mutual relations should not be confused with tolerance and freedom 
of mind much less with inspired genius Inexact undisciplined thinkcid
ing has  all  the  defects  of poetry without its  merits 

  To be a naturalist or a  commonsense philosopher is  to revert 
to trivialities thadt require no philosopher to utter  Such trivialities 
always  lead  on  to  antinomies  which  are  neither  sophistical  nor 
visionary To refuse to engage in justifications and analyses is to abdicid
cate human rationality 

  To rely on common sense supplemented by a  little qoeading  of 
philosophical prefaces and reviews is an easy road to Science Science 
however  requires  that  truth  should  be  won  by  the  labour  of the 
Notion developing itself in  its  own medium 

 I Tho ugh there have been many who value PIa to for his Ii terary 
myths  there have  been  times when his  Parmenides  has  been  seen  to 
be the supreme work of art of the  ancient dialectic and  the  positive 
expression  of the  divine life  There have  been  times  too  when  the 
philosophy of Aristotle was valued for its speculative depth We may 
hope that our system will penetrate public attention since it has had 
to wait till  its  time  was  ripe  and  its  public in existence  This  public 
does not consist of the soidisant representatives of public opinion 

  In our age the universal aspect of Spirit has been strengthened 
while  its  individual expressions  are  less  significant  In such an  age 
theindividual must forget his individuality and must do what he can 
while  less  should also  be  demanded of him by society 

INTRODUCTION  

 

INTRODUCTION 

  It is  a  natural idea  that before  engaging in  philosophical  incid

quiry  one should  first  examine  the  instrument  or  medium  of such 
knowledge  Locke  Kant  Perhaps it is  a good or a  bad instrument 
perhaps no good  at all  for  knowledge  of what absolutely  is  since  it 
modifies or distorts its object It is quite vain however to try to elimicid
nate  the  refracting and  transforming  powers  of the  instrument  and 
so  arrive at the intrinsic notion of the  thing  For if what  absolutely 
is cannot be reached by our faculty of knowledge with all its refracting 
and  transforming  power  there  is  no  sense  in  supposing  that  it  can 
be reached by dispensing with or discounting the work of this faculty 
and  the course  it has  to  take  Remove  the way truth affects  us  and 
nothing at all  remains 

  But if we doubttheability of knowledge to reach what absolutely 
is why not doubt thedoubt and soon It may be pointed out further 
thatthe notion of knowledge as a medium or instrument which stands 
in an external relation to what absolutely is  which is  quite separate 
from it is  a  wholly questionable notion which  makes knowledge imcid
possible from the start In our fear of error we are excluding the possicid
bility afknowledge 

  That we  might have knowledge of a  sort  eg  of phenomena 
but not  of what  absolutely  is  is  a  wholly  obscure  notion  to  which 
no one  has  managed  to  give  any clear  meaning  Even  knowledge 
of Schein  or Erscheinung  Hegel is  later to insist  is  knowledge  of how 
things  really appear to be or manifestly are 

  All  these  confused  conceptions  which  make  knowledge  incid

herentlyimpossible  must  be  dismissed  the  actual  development  of 
knowledge itselfsets them aside But knowledge in its first appearance 
is itselfmerely apparent and so defective Science cannotmerely claim 
to  be  better than  such  apparent knowledge  for  this  is  to  put itself 
on the level of the latter  and to rely  on its  mere existence  Nor can 
it appeal to its own rudimentary presence in apparent knowledge for 
this  is  not  in  apparent  knowledge  specially  distinctive  We  must 
accordingly say what apparent knowledge  really  is 

  Apparent knowledge  in all  its  varied forms  is  the  path  taken 
by the natural consciousness till it reaches true knowledge Along this 
path Soul becomes purified  into Spirit by a  complete experience of 
itself it comes  to  know what it in itself is 

  In philosophy fundamental beliefs are always being shaken and 
are not restored  in  the same form  as  in  the case  of ordinary  doubt 
We are not merely trained thinkers who are now  trying to  think for 
themselves  we  are  people who for  the first  time  are  really  learning 

ANALYSIS 

how  to  think  for  whom  the  results  of all  training  are  in  question 
Philosophical scepticism is  radical and not piecemeal 

  But in philosophy scepticism does  not merely doubt it always 
arrives at a determinate positive result a position whose positive truth 
involves  and  is  involved  by  the  negation  of the  position just concid
sidered before  Purely negative scepticism is  a  delusive form  of concid
sciousness which is  passed on  the way 

  The goal of knowledge is  a  situation where  there is  no longer 
an apparent element to  be discounted and  transcended  but where 
Notion and object are mutually adequate  Consciousness  by its very 
nature presses on to this goal  though it sometimes  retreats in terror 
from  this  endless  elftranscendence and  affects  to  regard  all  posicid
tions  of thought as  vain  and  empty  or  as  good  in  their  own  kind 
thereby increasing its  own vain selfimportance 

 I  To progress in selfcriticism it seems that there must be a criterion 
which knowledge  can apply to  itself  But knowledge  does  not  seem 
to  possess  any such criterion wherewith it can test itself 

g  Knowledge is  always given as correlated with an independent 
self existent objective somethilg the truth  This truth may be for concid
sciousness  but it also is  what it is  in itself 

  This independent selfexistenttruthmust however  itself be 
a truth for consciousness and this seems tp make consciQusnessits own 
criterion and to point to anotherselfexistent truth with which the first 
truth  can be  compared and so  on 

  In reality however both the selfexistent truth and the knowcid
leQge of it fall  within consciousness  Or otherwise  put  the opject as 
it intrinsically is  its  essence  on  tJle  one  hand and  the object as  an 
object for  consciousness  or a  Notion  on  the  other  both  fall  within 
consciousness and the latter has to be made to conform to theformer 
Or if we  identify  Notion and essence  and  the object is  what this  is 
for us  then we have to see  if the object conforms  to  the Notion  Both 
these processs  are the same ami in  them consciousness  only applies 
its own criterion to hself  This paragraph seems pure subjective idealcid
ismconsciousness in tes ting its ideas its immanen t con ten ts  merely 
confronts them with other ideas other immanent contents But it can 
also be interpreted as  saying that what objects  in themselves  arc is 
always  more or less  adequately  there in  and  for  consciousness  and 
in  knowledge  it  has  merely  to  replace  an  inadequate  by  a  more 
adequate revelation 

  Consciousness itself tes ts itself and compares itself with its  own 
object we  the philosophical observers can only observe it at work 
Consciousness  itself constantly changes its  view  of the  object  What 
the object was  intrinsically  an  sich  becomes  merely  what it is  for 
consciousness and a new Ansich develops We rna y say tha t conscious

I   SENSECERTAINTY  

ness  is  adjusting itself to  the  reality of being  but it is  more  correct 
to say that the reality of being is  adjusting itself to  consciousness  In 
this  adjustment  the criterion applied by consciousness is  itself being 
tested  and transformed 

  For  consciousness  to  negate  what  at  first  seemed  absolutely 

objective  and  for  it to  regard  this  absolute  truth  as  a  mere  truthcid
forconsciousness is for consciousness to have lived through an expericid
ence  Eifahrung  in  the  phenomenological  sense  which  always  incid
volves  selftranscendence 

  The progress of consciousness can be progress for consciousness 
it can also  be  a  progress  for  the  phenomenological  observer  who  is 
considering and commenting on consciousness  The phenomenologicid
cal observer sees  the links  of negation and  the resultant positiveness 
which springs from negation in the successive phases of consciousness  
whereas for consciousness itselfeach step involves a surprising transicid
tion  to  a  totally new object  The deep dialectic seen  by  the  phenocid
menological observer goes on behind the back of consciousness itself 
  Science includes in its content the road to Science the account 

of its  own essential  experience 

g  The shapes of consciousness  are  not  fully  conscious  of themcid

selves  as  shapes  of consciousness  nor of their place  in  a  continuous 
conscious  history  until  the end of the road is  reached

go  The knowledge from  which our phenomenological  investigacid
tion  starts is  absolutely immediate  knowledge  which is  also  knowcid
ledge ofwhat immediately is  of what just is  there  What just is  there 
must simply betaken in registered we must not try to grasp it notioncid
ally  nor add anything to  what it lays  before  us 

  This sort of knowledge appears to be inexhaustibly rich inconcid

teDt and also in extent What it lays  before  us  seems  to  be infinitely 
divisible  and  to  stretch  away  infinitely  in  time  and space  It also 
appears to be the truest knowledge we  can  possess  since it omits no 
detail of the object But this  kind of knowledge  also shows itself up 
to the phenomenological observer  as  tire  poorest and most abstract 
possible  it  merely  acknowledges  the heing  of the  object  The  concid
sciousness  which is  aware  of what  to us  merely  is  there  is  likewise 
denuded  of content  it does  no  thinking work  it connects  nothing 
with nothing it simply registers  It is just I  this  consciousness  concid
fronting  this  immediate content 

  When scrutinized  however  senseconsciousness  reveals  itself 
asJess purelyimmediate than it at first seemed It involves two typical 

ANALYSIS 

 
factors an indefinite registered content and an indefinite  registering 
self and theseconsti tu te a necessary form or structure There is a regis 
tering self only because there is an immediate content to register and 
there is  a  registered content only because there is  a self to  register  it 
We are dealing with a general pattern of experience not merely with 
a singular fact of existence  A tendency to selfcorrection is  inherent 
in consciousness and this distinguishes its subjectivity from  its  objeccid
tivity  

  Not only does  sensecertainty embody this subjectobject patcid
tern it also involves a claim something gesetzt  posited that one factor 
is  more true and essential than the other The object comes before it 
as  the True the essential  that which is  there whether there is  knowcid
ledge or not Knowledge con trariwise is given as secondary I  unessen  
tial it presupposes depends on is  mediated  by the object which is 
truly immediate and does  not presuppose or depend on it  Realism 
is thus not an imposed theory bu t part and parcel of ourmos t elemencid
tary experiences Weare dealing wi th something whose deeper na ture 
will come out as  we  examine  it  but  is  not exhaustively  and  finally 
given 

  Sense  certain tyseems however to involve an inheren t conflict 
Its object asgiven in it does  not match what that obJectis given out 
as  being This content is  not introduced by a reflective observer but 
is part and parcel of sensecertainty itself I t is because sensecertainty 
feels  itself not  to  be the rich thing it on the surface claims  to  be  that 
it tries  to  make  out  to perceive  what it has  before  it 

  The immediate This ofsensecertainty involves  the  two  con 
neted forms  of the Now and the Here  Ifwe try to pin  the  Now 
down bygivingi tdefinitcconten t thatcontent is quite inconstant Wha t 
nowobtains is night but a little Jater  what now obtains is not night 
but noon  Since  what is  always  changes  its  appearance  we  never 
get at it  it  is  the  complete  thing  which  underlies  changing appearcid
ances 

  The now  of sensecertainty reveals itself as  inherently universal 
ie itcannotbeidentified with anyone definite state of things though 
it can alsoindifferentlyhe anyone such stateor another Universals 
obey a different logicfrom their instances  Notonly the characters of 
what is are universals bud  generalform is itselfuniversal ie the concid
crete reality  behind changing appearances 

  In the use of demonstrative words  there is  a  conflict between 
what we really say and what we  mean to say  our  Meinung  was  wir 
meinen  We  mean  to  express  what is  ultimately individual  but  this 
is  inexpressible  all  we succeed  in  expressing is  what is  universaL 
g  The demonstrative Here behaves exactly like  the demonstracid
tive  Now and always changes its  application  It is  therefore  a  case 

I SENSE CERTAINTY I  

of pure universality We cannot pin down the individual position qua 
individual  only individuality in general 

  The universality of pure being which has  revealed itself as  the 
essence  of sensewcertainty  involves  abstraction  but  it  is  not  as  it 
seemed to be real abstractionfrom rich contents but abstraction from 
the mere meaning or claim to  have rich  contents  Individuality on 
Hegels view is  a  mere  moment of living  concrete  universality 

roo  Since the object of sensecertainty is not the definite contentful 
thingit claimed to be the phenomenological emphasis shifts to the Subcid
ject  My  experience  becomes  the  rich  colourful  thing  What  I  mean 
is  important  because  it stems  from  me  Meinen  and  meinJ  Like 
Descartes Hegel shifts  to  the individual Subject as  that of which we 
are certain 

  But in the flux of experience the me which experiences always 

has different successive contents to its experience and cannot therecid
fore be identified with such contents The me of the moment may mean 
to  be  definite  in  content  but it cannot express  this  definiteness  It 
is  in a  sense  as  much a  plurality as  a single me 

  Theme alsostandsessentiaHyopposed to other mes and cannot 
say how this  me  differs from  another  Each man is  as  an experient 
everyman  The  individual  as  such  cannot  be  understood  or 
deduced 

  We  now  move  to  a  position where not the  mere  object  nor 
the mere subject is the rich contentful thing but the whole structured 
subjectobject situation 

  The whole structured subject  objectsituation is  asessenticid

ally fluctuating as  the mere subject or object considered before  The 
wholly  definite  timesituation  we  try  to  pin  down  at once  becomes 
a matter of the past  the only present that can survive is  a  universal 
present which  remains  what it is  despite  variation  of content  and 
which  has  subordinate  presents  within  it  From  the  many  Nows 
which arise and pass  away we  come  to  a  Now  which  always  is  no 
matter how  long a happening may be  This is  of course  a  universaL 
The substantial the permanent is the Universal not the particular 
  The wholly definite Here the poin t cannot be seized Every 
real Here breaks up into Heres or points to  Heres beyond itself 
But in aU  these  Heres  the universal  Here persists  We  cannot get 
parts but strictly speaking only the whole of Reality and  the whole 
of Reality is  a  universal  present in  aU  its  socalled  parts 

  Sense  certainty never grasps  definite  particulars  but always 
deludes itself into  thinking  that it does  In  the  Mysteries  bread and 
wine  are consumed  to  show  the nullity of the  solid  things  of sense 
and hungry animals reveal  the  same mystical wisdom 

  Language being divine and rational frustrates  the  attempt 

ANALYSIS 

  
of sensecertainty  to  grasp  surd  particulars  it only  expresses  unicid
versals The truth of sensecertainty is  takingfortrue ie perception 
The dialectic is  much influenced by arguments in  Platos  Theaetetus 
where the impossibility of reconciling knowledge with radical subjectcid
objectfluxis maintained and the unchanging universal ideas are shown 
to be necessary Wittgenstein would regard Hegels treatment as  restcid
ing on a  misunderstanding of demonstratives  which  are  unique lincid
guistic  instruments  and neither name nor describe 

II  PERCEPTION 

I  I  I  Immediate certaintys true object is the universal but it wants 

to deal with the immediate This  Perception acknowledges the unicid
versal  the general  pattern  to  be  its  object  but it does  not  yet see 
this to be the essential element in its object it is  we  the phenomenocid
logical  observers  who  see  this  to  be  the  essential  element  and  the 
necessary outcome of what has gone before For perception itself  the 
essen tialelementisagainthe  bject as in thesensecertainty The object 
is  the essential  constant  independent element while  perception  is 
givenas unessential variable dependent Perception does notseethat 
subject and object are equally the  unessential  forms  in which  a  unicid
versal  pattern is  cast 

  The object can however  only  be  a  universal  pattern in so 
far as it unites many distinct elements  ie  properties  in its  pattern 
The perceptual object is really given with the interior richness which 
the objectofsenseis only taken to have  Universality is  meaningless 
without specificity 

I   The thing of perception  is  sensegiven  but its  sensuousness 
is universal ie appears in the form of a  property Sense is  aufgehohen 
destroyed yet preserved in the perceptual thing But the universality 
of perception necessarily  dirempts itself into  a  number of mutually 
exclusive  properties  which  at  the  same  time it brings  together  Its 
structure involves  an inherent conflict  From one  point of view it is 
an absolute unity that ofaspacetime region which brings the propcid
erties indifferently together so that where the one is  the other is  also 
while from another point of view it breaks up into the many distinct 
properties  each oLwhich can be considered in and for  itself 

I    The more loose  Also of a  medium points however to some 
more  absolute  kind  of unity  which  excludes  otherness  rigidly  from 
itself This absolute unity can be attributed to the several properties 
or it can be attributed to the thing as such  We have the alternatives 
it would seem ofha ving either a bundle of properties or a metaphysicid
cal peg to hang them on or both  Very uncertain of interpretation 

II  PERCEPTION III 

  The perceived Thing represents a difficult compromise of a 
a set of properties loosely  together and supplementing each  other in 
the  Thing  b  the  Thing as  the spacetime location or medium  in 
which the properties are brought together  c  the properties treated 
as  pure  universals  having  a  status  outside  of the  particular  Thing 
   The dialectic  now  takes  a  new  turn  The  perceptual  object 
being this curious mixture ofinterna togetherness and apartness  the 
subject regards it as  essentially constant and selfsame  All  departures 
from Sichselbstgleichheit are attributed to  the subject  are  its  illusions 
and are not  to  be found  in  the object 

I    Consciousness now becomes aware of the contradictions in the 
object which only we the phenomenological observers have seen in 
it  The object first  presents  itself as  a  pure unity  but the  properties 
are all universal and could exist outside of it The unity of the object 
is  therefore my  confusion or mistake and the object is  really only an 
association of universals  But in such a loose association the properties 
are not effectively brought together so as to exclude one another   the 
object is  therefore again a  pure unity  and  the properties  mere sides 
of it  Butthe properties  are  often  mutually  indifferent  so  that  the 
objects unity again vanishes  The properties now become so  wholly 
qetached that tbey noloJlger contrast with anything  and no longer 
are  properties We are back at the blank being of sensecertainty 

I    Consciousnes now  repeats  the  whole  circle  somewhat  difcid
fereJldy  It becomes conscious of the  essential  untruth of all  percepcid
tion and attributes this untruth to itself  being at thesame time made 
aware of its power to correct perception and arrive at the naked reali ty 
behind perception which corrected picture it again recognizes as  its 
own 

  The doctrine of primary and secondary qualities  is  now decid

veloped  The object itself is  conceived  as  profoundly  simple  but it 
is  perceived  with a variety  of properties  because  it affects  various 
bodily organs eye ear etc The conscious Ego now becomes the comcid
mon  medium  in  which  all  the  Things  senseaspects  are  brought 
together 

  By a new shift in the dialectic it is made plain that iEthe Thing 

is conceived as absolutely One it will be no longer possible to distincid
guish it from other things all will be wholly blank unities and so indiscid
tinguishable A Thing mustbe whatitis only by having its own propcid
erties those proper and peculiar to itself Since each of these properties 
has its own separate being  the Thing again becomes a  loose associacid
tion  of properties  it is  A  and also Band also  C  etc 

I J  Consciousness now instead of attributing the  plurality of the 
Things properties to itself  and  making  the  thing intrinsically One 
makes  the  Thing  intrinsically  an  assemblage  of properties  of free 

ANALYSIS 

mattersthe physics  of Hegels  day  spoke  of electrical  calorific 
chromatic  matterswhile  the objects  unity  is  a  sort  of fiction  for 
which consciousness  alone is  responsible 

  Consciousness now gets tired of attributing such diverse errors 
to itself and simply recognizes that the Thing itself as reflected into 
itself  has  this  diversity  of opposing aspects  in it  It at one  moment 
shows itselfas a profound unityat another moment as a  loose assemcid
blage of properties 

  Consciousness  no  longer  attributes  the  objects  oscillation 
between profound unity and dirempted multiplicity to consciousness 
but to the object  But  a  new  device  occurs  to  it  The object  is  put 
forth  as  profoundly One while its  diversity of aspects  are due  to  its 
relations not with consciousness but with other objects  which as  it 
were  call forth  different responses  from  it 

  It seems absurd however  that Things without intrinsic difcid
ferences should be coaxed into showing difference by their mere relacid
tions with other Things without intrinsic difference We are therefore 
forced  to  postulate an internal distinctiveness  Unterschied  which  is 
essential to the object and an external diversity Verschiedenheit  from 
otherobjects which is an unessential conseq uence of this  I t is because 
Things  are  intrinsically  distinctive  that they  are  also  extrinsically 
diverse 

  We  are  however  unable  to  distinguish  this  internal  discid
tinctiveness from the external diversity The Things absolute characcid
terseems the same as its relatedness  to  other Things and viee  versa 
  Same  point  restated  The  Things  absolute  selfrelation 
which negates all otherness also shows itselfup as being no more than 
thoroughgoing relation  to others 

  Same point The extrinsic which is  none  the less quite necescid

sary  is  really intrinsic 

  We cannot draw subtle distinctions between  the object as  it 
intrinsically is  and  the object as  it is  in  relation  to  other  Things 
The former  is  the  latter  and  the  latter  the  former we  have a  discid
tinction without a  difference  ie  a  merely  meant  intended verbal 
distinction  

  The Thing is  therefore  essentially  overcome as  it was  previcid

ously overcome on its sensuous side  The latter revealed itself as pure 
universality but asa universality infected ith several conflicts that 
of the universal and the individual that of the unity of the properties 
in the Thing and their isolation as free matters that of being intrinsiccid
ally this or that and that of being something only in relation to other 
Things The nature of the Thing is  therefore simply the nature of the 
Understanding which constitutes it and in which all  these  tensions 
are always  present 

III  FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING  

 

  The sophistry of perception tries  to save  itself by a  device  of 
aspects  and  in  so  fars  I t  talks  of the  perceived  object  in  so far  as 
it is  one object  in  so far  as  it is  many  properties  in  so far  as  it has 
selfexistence  in  so far  as  it is  related  to  other  things  etc  This  sort 
of device must be abandoned It is  the pure universality of the Begrijf 
of the  Notion which emerges which involves  in  inseparable  union 
the universal the specific and the singular the separate and the inter 
related 

  Perceptual understanding is dominated by the empty abstraccid
tions  of individuality and  universality  of the  essential  and  the  uncid
essential etc  I tdespises philosophy for concerning itself with  Gedancid
kendinge  but in effect deals with nothing else itself  and merely oscilcid
lates from one crude abstract thought to  another  If it could  realize 
that it  is  dealing with  thoughts concepts  it would  be their  master 
and shape them as it wills  but it imagines that it is  dealing with real 
matters substances etc  In its vain wanderings the perceptual undercid
standing fails  to arrive at the  truth of things  though it plainly reveals 
its  own untru th 

III  FORCE AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING 

  The  Thing  of perception  has  passed  away into  a  universal 
which is unconditioned since it includes what is specific and individual 
in itself and is not merely an essence set over against the unessential 
Consciousness  has  implicitly  grasped  the  notional  character  of its 
object but not having itself become purely notionalfails to recognize 
itself in the object before it  which is  still  treated as  an object alien 
to  itself 

l  The  object  of consciousness  is  consciousnesss  own  notional 
object but the consciousness tifthis notional character its Fursichsein 
is lacking Hence it comes before consciousness as freely active in indecid
pendence of consciousness consciousness merely watches it in action 
It is  we  the  phenomenological  observers  who  must  transform  the 
object for  consciousness  till consciousness can see  and grasp itself in 
the opject 

  Consciousness has thoroughly identified its objects being  forcid

selfand its beingfaranother This is not merely the objecfs form but 
its content as  well  it is  the sort of object tha t in being for itself is  for 
another and vice versa And this  unity of the  two  aspects  is  all  that 
the object  has  become 

  None the less  since  the aspects  are identified  they  are  also 
distinguished and consciousness  therefore  has  before  it  the  contrast 
ofa number oflooselyarrayed elements on the one hand and a  pro

ANALYSIS 

found  unity on  the  other  But  these  aspects  are  no  longer  given  as 
rival views which merely oust one another but each is  given as essenticid
ally and necessarily  passing over into the  other 

  The  process  of Force  is  precisely  the  process  in  which  discid

persed independent elements  come out from  a  unity in which  they 
were lost and again lose themselves in this unity  The dispersed  elecid
ments  are  the  expression  or  manifestation  of Force  while  Force 
proper or Force unexpressed  is  the  unity  out of which  these manicid
festations  issue  For thought the distinctions may have no substance 
but the thought has  to be carried out in  the  stuff of perception  and 
for  perception  Force  unmanifest  is  obviously  different  from  Force 
manifest The two forms of Force are always vanishing into each other 
for  Force exists  in so  far as  they keep  up this  mutual vanishing 

  Though it is  Force itself which  by its nature passes  from  its 
unexpressed to its expressed form  hese forms  appear to  be mutually 
external  Not only is  this so  but the  passage  from  one  to  the other 
necessarily  appears  as  an  external incitation  or  solicitation  Somecid
thing external to  the unmanifest Force provokes  it to  manifest itself 
and something external  to  the  manifest  Force  provokes  it to  retreat 
into unmanifest latency  This external solicitation is  only in appearcid
ance external and is  really an inseparable aspect of the  Force itself 
  A  Force is  thus  seen  as  essentially  breaking  up  dirempting 
itselfinto two Forcesone thatis solicited to express itself or withdraw 
itself from expression  and  the other which solicits it to  do just this 
On examination however the spliciting Force is  itself solicited into 
soliciting by the  Force it solicits  and hence  both  Forces solicit  and 
are solicited  by one another 

  These two Forces solicit and are solicited by one another each 
appearing in relation to the other as medium in which properties are 
distinguished and as a merely latent power Each may be said to work 
upon  the other or to  be worked on by it  because  that other is  not 
really distinct from  its  own self 

  The difference of the  two  Forces or aspects  of Force is  both 
a difference in content medium of properties and latent power  and 
form soliciting and solicited The distinction ofform is  given as  incid
trinsic  while  that  of content exists  merely  for  the  observer  But  in 
the actual process of Force both these differences are eliminated The 
active solicitor turns into the  passive  object of solicitation  and  vice 
versa  For the phenomenological observer too  the notional unity of 
the two extremes is evident  the solicitor is also  the solicited and the 
realized  content is  also  the  latent form  and vice versa 

II  Each aspect of Force is a reality on its own but its  being concid

sists  essentially in a  movement  towards  a  vanishing  into  the  other 
aspect Its being consists in a Gesetztsein a positedness or being posited 

III  FORCE AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING  

 

by the other aspect  There is  nothing fixed  and substantial in either 
aspect by itself  the  Notion of both is  found  in  their essential  unity 
The true being of Force is  not  the  reality it seems  to  gain or lose  by 
being expressed or unexpressed but the universal the thought which 
is  present in both  these states 

  Force therefore appears in two guises as  a  substantial entity 
active  in  the world of phenomena and as  a  pure Notion  behind or 
beneath phenomena  The latter is  the  truer view 

  Consciousness now sees  itself as  penetrating beneath  the surcid
face  show  Schein  of things  with its  perpetual vanishing  of factors 
and  forces  to  a  true  background  of which  the surface  show  is  the 
appearance  Erscheinung  In  the  surface  play  of Forces  everything 
negates and cancels  everything  but  the  true  background  is  wholly 
positive  This whole background consists  essentially of pure Notions 
which are part ofthe Subjects innermost selfconsciousness The Subcid
jectdoes not however as yet realize their subjective notional characcid
ter and sees them as an hiner essential depth in the objects themselves 
  The Understanding therefore at this stage conceives ofa true 
supersensible  permanent  world  a  Jenseits  which  lies  essentially 
beyond the Diesseits qthis vanishing world of appearances This world 
is a world of notional con tents inadequCitely conceived as  alien  to  the 
mind 

  The  conscious  sphere  of  appearances  is  the  middle  term 

through which the Understanding penetrates inferentially to  the  incid
ner essential nature of things 

  The inner essential  nature of things  is  readily  conceive as 
a mere void a region in which nothing positive can be known  Kants 
thinginitself  Even  subjective  fancies  are  better  than  notions  so 
wholly  void of content 

  But the inneressential is  essentially  the truth  of appearance 

the truth in w hichimmediate sensecertainty and perception are overcid
come notionally transformed  It stands in a negative but not merely 
negative  relation  to  the world of appearance 

  Since Force and its expression are through and through diacid
lectical the soliciting being also the solicited and the medium of propcid
erties  also  the latent force  the  Understanding is  driven  beyond  the 
play of Forces  to  the principle  present in  them all  This is  no other 
than  the  law  which  governs  all  the manifestatiops  of one  Force 

  A law is an abiding image of restless  appearances a  pripciple 

which in governing change and revealed in change is itselfunchangcid
ing  The supersensible world  is  a  tranquil  kingdom of laws 

  The kingdom oflaws has an ever varying actual existence in 
the world under ever varying circumstances  It tends  to  be  thought 
of in an ever more abstract way and so becomes refined into the mere 

ANALYSIS 

empty form  of law  as  such  Hegel  thinks  that  the  law  of universal 
gravitation has  this empty chanicter  it merely says  that everything 
has a  lawdetermined relation  to  everything else  This is  important 
only as  setting bounds  to  chance and sensuous  independence 

 I  Hegel hinks that beyond specific laws is  the bare conception 
oflaw which transcends specific laws and even law as such  It reduces 
all distinctions of content and form which occur in laws into an abso 
lute  unity  a  pure necessity 

  The duplicity of Force and expression  reappears in  the  case 

oflaws Laws have both an explicit specification in which all  the difcid
ferences  to  which  they  apply  have  a  distinct  expression  they  also 
occur as pure universalities in which all such specification is somehow 
absorbed and nullified Simple electricity eg  is  the absolute  unity 
behind  positive  and  negative  electricity  and  the  laws  connecting 
them simple gravity is  the absolute unity behind the factors of mass 
distance velocity etc and the laws connecting them Wherever there 
are laws there isa deep underlying unity expressed in them and every 
deep unity expresses  itself in characteristic laws 

  In the common representation of the deep nature behind laws 
a  law is  readily  thought of as  a  mere  byproduct  of the  relation  of 
the factors  present inthe law  eg  motion  is  an accidental  relation 
between the independent variables of distance and time etc  This is 
a  deeply wrong way of conceiving  the  matter  Motion  is  in  reality 
the whole which distance and time alike presuppose  and  in  which 
alone they make sense and so on in other similar cases eg  gravitacid
tion  There can be no laws  except where  there is  a  common deeper 
nature behind  the laws 

  The Understanding is now temptedto regard the deeper unity 

behind the law as somethingthat we postulate and which is  not propcid
erlyto be attributed to the thing The nature behind the law is merely 
the law otherwise expressed The process of tau tologiza tion ofreduc 
ing the same to the same is whatwe call explanation Various eleccid
trical phenomena arise in a lawgoverned manner because Electricity 
is  their common ground 

  We  are  however  brought  to  realize  that  the  distinction 
between the  law and  the  unitary nature  behind  the  law cannot  be 
regarded as merely a distinction thatwe draw The thing itself involves 
the  distinction  which  has  therefore  a  position  in  the  supersensible 
background of things 

  The very nature of the intelligible world is  thus  to  draw discid

tinctions which turn out to beno distinctions  It is  the selfsame which 
repels  itself from  itself  and  this  element repelled  is  in  consequence 
attracted to what has repelled it foritisthe same at bottom Passage 
illustrates  the  essential peculiarities of Hegelian logic 

Ill  FORCE  AND  THE  UNDERSTANDING    

 

  Hegel now passes to the difficult conception that in addition 
to the first intelligible world which is a tranquil kingdom onaws there 
must also  be a second intelligible world which embodies all  the discid
tinctions  and  exclusions  which  we  find  in  the  phenomenal  world 
There  must  not only  to  use  Platonic  language  be  single  Ideas  of 
essences  multiply instantiated there must also  be Ideas of Instances 
qua  Instances  and of Instantiation as  such  This  second  intelligible 
world will  be  the inverse  of the first  one 

  The inversion  is  now rather fancifully  worked out by Hegel 
in  the  statement  that what  is  sweet  in  the first  intelligible  world  is 
sour  in  the second  what is  a  north  pole  in  the  first  is  a  south  pole 
in  the  second  what  is  revenge  here  is  punishment  there  what  is 
honoured here is dishonoured there what is a disgrace here is a saving 
grace there and so on The inversions  of the Sermon on  the  Mount 
are used  to  illuminate  the inversions of physical explanation 

  On examination however  the inverted world shows itself to 
be indistinguishable from  the senseworld  of which it purports  at a 
second remove to be the essence Everything in the senseworld is there 
only with a  nuance of difference  that really amounts  to  nothing  It 
is quite as onesided in its way as  the senseworld and the first intellicid
gible  world are  onesided  All  it  em bodies  is  in  fact  presen t  in  the 
tensions and oppositions  of the actual senseworld  where  there  is  a 
real north pole lying side by side with the real south pole and so on 
  We progress to a  true view of the relation of essential nature 
to  outward manifestation if we see  both  the  profound  opposition  of 
the  two  which must  not  be  ignored  and  the  fact  that  each  factor 
is  the opposite of its  opposite  and so includes the whole opposition 
and its  opposite in itself  The supersensible  world  in  particular  in 
being  the inverse of the sensible  world  includes  the  sensible  world 
in itself  Cf  Plotinus Everything that is  yonder is  also here Such 
a distinction within a  profound identity is called  by Hegel  infinity 
since the  thing is  not bounded by an opposite alien and  external to 
itself 

  Infinity  means  that  we  have  a  a  unitary  nature  eg 
motion electricity which direm pts itselfin to b a number of distinct 
interconnected factors space time positive electricity negative deccid
tricityetc which none the less  c show themselves as  overcome cancid
celled  in  their  common  unity  They  are  inseparable  aspects  of the 
common  unity  in question 

  There is  no  problem  in  the  seWdiremption  of an  absolute 
unity  It can only  be an absolute  unity if it also  dirempts itself and 
is itselfin such diremption If it merely stood opposed to diremption 
it would not be the absol u te uni ty but be itselfdirempted from somecid
thing else 

ANALYSIS 

  The  truth of all  these  convolutions  lies  in  the  selfconscious 
Understanding which is  in  all  this  merely  discovering  itself and  its 
varied  aspects  and internal  tensions  This  need  not be  interpreted 
in  a  purely subjective  manner  The  Understanding has  not  manucid
factured  the natural world  But both  are sides  of the  Absolute  Idea 
whose  function  it is  to  realize itself in selfconscious  Spirit 

  The Understanding does not however  realize  that all  these 
dissolving distinctions are merely  the internal manreuvres of its  own 
selfconsciousness only we  the  phenomenological observers  realize 
this 

  The two extremes of the Understanding gazing into the inner 
world of essence and this inner realm itself are now merged together 
The curtain of appearance is drawn aside and the Ego qua expression 
of the  Absolute  Idea will  come  to see  only  itself beyond  But for  it 
to realize  that it is  seeing itself  it must itself go  behind  the  curtain 
and  to  do this  requires several  prior steps  and stages 

IV  THE  TRUTH  OF  SELFCERTAINTY 

J   So  far  certainty  has  always  been  outwardturned  It  has 
affirmed  the  truth of something other than itself  But  this  reference 
to sheer otherness has shown  itself up  as  empty and  untrue  and  a 
certainty has arisen which measures up to its tru th certainty is certain 
of certainty and consciousness has its own  truth in consciousness  A 
residual distinction remains  out it  is  also  a  distinction overruled  a 
distinction between a concept as an act or cognitive motion and the 
tranquil content which is  itself  or between  the concept as  the mere 
selfbeing of the objectand the object as  thereforanother  The concid
scious  Ego is  both  the  related subjectobject terms and the relation 
between them it has an Other which it overreaches and sees as  itself 

  In the new state of selfconsciousness  the features  of the  precid

vious otherconsciousness are summed up and preserved but only as 
insubstantial vanishing phases There must be a trace in it of the imcid
mediate separate being of the sensegiven world which is  however 
given as  a  mere appearance  and devoid of genuine substance  Selfcid
consciousness feels  the  unity of this  seeming other  world  with  itself 
in the form ofa desire to abolish this seeming otherness and to discover 
i tselfin this alien content The nature of Desire to abolish the othercid
ness  of the Other 

r  To desire in the subject  there corresponds in  the object life 
which like desire  seeks  to  achieve infinity  and  to  be itself without 
knowing itself  in its  other  The living object has implicitly the same 

IV  THE TR UTH  OF  SELFCER TAINTY    

  

selftranscendentcompleteness which is explicitly realized in selfconcid
sciousness 

  The  essence  of life  is  infinity  as  the  supersession  o all  discid

tinctions tranquilly seated at the centre of axial rotation the moving 
essence of time congealed into spatial solidity All  distinctions  in  the 
living organism pass away in flux but must have a momen tary solidity 
and separateness in order to pass away in this  manner Fluidity pure 
movement  is  the essence  of the living 

  The independent members of the living  organism  have  their 
limited selfexistence which however is  nothing but their relation to 
the total flux of living and which itself in its  truth is  nothing beyond 
a  constant diremption into independent shapes  The unity of life  is 
constantly dirempted because only as  dirempted can it continue  to 
be a  unity  Shapes pass  away  and  are  superseded  by  other  shapes 
because  their  real  Substance  is  the  flux  which  is  constantly  being 
dirempted in  them 

  As fluidity life always involves a gamut ofindependent forms 
each  asserting  itself against  the  others  and  against  the  whole  flux 
itself Either can be regarded as  the Ansich  the inner self oflife while 
the  other is  merely  the  other side  of this  Life  constantly  consumes 
and dissolves its solid structures and therefore has general dissolution 
as  its  constant essence  but agaip it regenerates  such  structures  out 
of such  consumption  and  dissolution  and  therefore  has  articulate 
diremption as its constant essence  This  turning and  twisting  is  the 
essence of life  life  indeed is  absolute  turning  and  twisting  It is  an 
ever  developing  ever dissolving  whole  which  in  development  and 
dissolution  simply  maintains its  being 

  Life proceeds from immediate unity through articulation and 
proces back  to  a  like  unity  which  however  being  repeated  is  a 
generic unity  The constant simple genus which is  maintained in life 
points to consciousness for which alonesuch a genus exists qua  genus 
  Selfconsciousness which contemplates genera and which  is 
itself purely generic is atfirstawareofitsefas a  pure Ego an extreme 
abstraction which will however  enrich and  differentiate itself 

  The pure Ego is the simple universal which seeks at this stage 
to assert itself by abolishing the articulate forms which stand or seem 
to  stand opposed  to  it It is  essentially desire  need 

  The  object  which  the  pure  Ego  of selfconsciousness  seeks 
essentially to abolish is however essential to its being as an abolishing 
activity and is  therefore always regenerated  as  much  as  abolished 
Selfconsciousness can therefore only achieve satisfaction in so  far  as 
the  object abolishes  itself  shows  itself to  selfconsciousness  as  really 
being selfconsciousness Selfconsciousness can only achieve satisfaccid
tiop  in  another  selfconsciousness 

 

ANALYSIS 

  The manner in which the living organism abolishes articulate 

otherness and in  which ordinary desire does so  are  merely  undevelcid
oped versions of the abolition of otherness which occurs in the mutual 
recognition  of two  selfconscious  persons 

  Only in a selfconsciousness for a selfconsciousness do we have 
a  true  accomplished  case  of selfconsciousness  where  the  object of 
consciousness is  also its subject  Animal  desire is  only  universal subcid
stance  pursuing  universal  substance  here subject  pursues  and  also 
finds  subject  We  have now risen  to  the  level of Spirit  the  I  which 
is a We and the We which is an   We have moved from the coloured 
show of thisworld ense and the empty notional nigh t of U nders tandcid
ing into the spiritual daylight of what is completely present  Hegel 
holds  that  the  understanding of other  minds  far  from  being  more 
obscure than the understanding of things is  the model and paradigm 
in terms of which intercourse with things can assume a limited clarity 
In all  intercourse with  things  we  are striving  towards  the  complete 
penetration and ucidity of social  intercourse 

LORDSHIP  AND  BONDAGE 

  SelfconsQjousness exists in and for  itself inasmuch and only 
inasmuch as  it exists  in  and  for itself for  anotherie  inasmuch  as 
it is  acknozyledged  It is  therefore  essentilyone only  in duplication 
andrveals itself in a  number of traits which have  to  be kept firmly 
apartandyet reveal themselves as alwtYs  melting into one another 
and dissoJying  this  a partnes 

  Self  consciousness  lives  outside  of itself in another  selfconcid

sciousness  in which  it at once  loses  and also finds  itself 

  Selfconsciousness  is  intrinsically  set  to  eliminate  this  alien 
selfhood bllt  in being so  set  it is  both set  to eliminate  the other in 
order to achieve its own sef  certain ty and also  to elimina te  itself in 
the process  since it is  itself that other 

IS  Thisdualeliminationinvolves however a return to self since 
what is  eliminated  is  its  own otherbeing while it at the same  time 
permits the other to be othersince it removes its own  being from  the 
other 

  The process just outlined in    is  not however  carried 

out  solely  by  one  consciousness  on  the  other  but  by  both  concid
sciousnesses on each other  It can only be successfully carried out by 
either consciousness  because it sees  the other doing  to it just what it 
does  to  the  other  each in fact  demands that the other should  treat 
it just as  it treats  the other 

  Each consciousness  then  acts  on itself as  much  as  it acts  on 
the other  and  what  it  does  is  as  much  done  by  the  other  to  it  as 
by it to  the other consciousness 

IV  THE  TRUTH  OF  SELFCERTAINTY Ig 

 

  Separate consciousnesses reenact at a higher level the action 
of mutually soliciting forces  which in soliciting each  other  in effect 
only put themselves forth Each uses the other as  the means by which 
it achieves selfconsciousness To mutual solicitation mutual recognicid
tion here corresponds  as  well as  the recognition of mutual recognicid
tion 

  The recognition of self in its  other at first  presents itself in a 
onesided form in which only the one side does  the recognizing  and 
the  other side  is  merely recognized 

  Selfconsciousness  is  at  first  simple  beingforself  which  is 
attached to an immediate individuality which excludes all others from 
itself Self at firs t cDnfronts self not as an infinite negation of the negacid
tion  making all its own but as a simple case of natural being facing 
another such case both deeply absorbed in the business ofliving Each 
is  conscious  only of its  own  being  and so  has  no  true  certainty  of 
itself since the being of the self is  essentially a socially acknowledged 
being 

  Selfconsciousness  must  however  express  itself as  the  negacid

tion of all mere objectivity and particularity This initially  takes  the 
form of desiring the death of the other at the risk of its own life   Selfcid
consciousness fillst be willing to  sacrifice  everything concrete for  its 
own infinite selfrespect and  the similar respect of all others  A  lifecid
anddeath struggle  therefore  ensues  between  the  two  rival self  concid
sciousnesses 

  For both members to die in the lifeanddeath struggle would 
not however resolve the tension between them Nor would the death 
of one  of them  do  it  Death  certainly  eliminates  all  opposition 
but only for others  or in  a  dead  manner  Death does  not preserve 
the  struggle  that  it eliminates  in  and  for  the  parties  in  question 
For  preservation  it is  essential  that  the  parties  in  question  should 
live 

g  The demotion of another selfconsciousness so that it does not 
reaUycornpete with my selfconsciousness now takes the new form Df 
making it thinglike and dependen t  the selfconsciousness ofa bonds  
man as  opposed  to  that of a  lord  That the  two  selfconsciousnesses 
are at bottom the same becomes  deeply  veiled 

  The selfconsciousness of the lord is essentially related  to  the 
being of the  mere  things  he  uses  and  uses  up  and  these  he  enjoys 
through the bondsmans selfconsciousness  The bondsman  prepares 
and arranges things for the enjoyment of the lord The selfconsciouscid
ness of the lord is  likewise essentially related to  the selfconsciousness 
of the bondsman through the various punitive constraining and recid
warding instruments which keep the bondsman in thrall The bondscid
man working on things does not completely overcome their thingness 

  

ANALYSIS 

since they do not become what he wishes  them to be or not for himcid
self  It is  the  lord  who  reaps  the  enjoyment  from  the  bondsmans 
labours 

I  We  thus  achieve  an  essentially  unbalanced  relationship  in 
which  the bondsman altogether gives  up his  beingforself in  favour 
of the lord  The lord  uses  him as  an  instrument to  master the  thing 
for  his own  the lords  purposes and not for  thebondsmans  and 
the  bondsman  acquiesces  in  the  situation  and  becomes in fact  part 
and parcel of the total objective situation This means however  that 
the lord cannot get the reciprocal recognition that his selfconsciouscid
ness demands from a  consciousness so degraded and distorted  What 
the lord sees in the bondsman or what the bondsman sees in the lord 
is  not what either sees  in himself 

  The lord therefore paradoxically depends for his lordship on 

the bondsmans selfconsciousness and entirely fails of the fully realcid
ized independence of status which his selfconsciousness demands 

  The truth of independent selfconsciousness is  therefore to be 
found rather in the bondsmans selfconsciousness than in  the lords 
Each is  therefore the inverse of what it immediately and superficially 
is  given as  being 

  The bondsman in his boundless quaking respect for  the lord 
becomes shaken out of his narrow seWidentifications and selfinterest 
and rises  to  the absolute negativity  the  disinterested allembracingcid
ness  of true selfconsciousness  He  becomes  the ideal which  he  concid
templates in his  lord 

  The bondsman has the further advantage that in working on 
the object he as it were preserves his labour makes the outward thing 
his own and puts himself into it whereas  the lords dealings with the 
object end in vanishing enjoyments  The  bondsman  overcomes  the 
otherness and mere existence of material thinghood more thoroughly 
than  the lord  and so  achieves  a  more genuine selfconsciousness 

  The bondsman in overcoming the mere existence of material 
thinghoodalsorises above the q uakingfearwhich was his first reaction 
to absolute otherness as embodied in the lord  Then he achieved selfcid
consciousness in opposition to such otherness now he achieves a  selfcid
consciousness not opposed to otherness  but which discovers  itself in 
otherness  In shaping the thing creatively  he  becomes  aware of his 
own boundless originality Hegel thinks that the discipline of service 
and obedience is essential toseifconsciousness mere mastery ofthings 
alone would not yield it  Only  the  discipline  of service  enables  the 
conscious being to master himself  ie  his  finite  contingent natural 
self  Without this discipline formative  ability  would degenerate into 
a narrow cleverness placed at the service of personal selfwilL  Hegel 
suggests that a period of subjection to others is essential to  the highest 

IV  THE TRUTH  OF  SELFCERTAINTY lgl 

 

magisterial rationality Not to have undergone such discipline results 
in a  trivialization of selfconsciousness which never rises  above petty 
finite interests It would seem that the permissive bringingup of childcid
ren is implicitly condemned and that imperialism and colonialism 
at certain stages  of development are given  a justification 

FREEDOM  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

  In the servile selfconsciousness we have the moments of pure 
universal beingforself projected on to  the lord and its own implicit 
selfexistence projected on to  the particular contentual things it elabcid
orates  These  moments  are  not  united  in  the  servile  consciousness 
but for  us  the  observers  they  are  identical  and  we  are  therefore 
brought to think of an essentially infinite free  thinking selfconsciouscid
ness which preserves its selfsameness in the various purely conceptual 
contents thatitenvisages At first  however its content is not unfolded 
nor set in motion and it appears as merely the unfettered universality 
of thought 

  The form of selfconsciousness now before us can be identified 
with that historical Stoicism which  makes  of consciousness  a  purely 
thinking essence  to  which nothing can be of moment  except  to  the 
extent that it puts its own thinkingheinginto it 

  In this form of selfconsciousness all  deailed content of concid

sciousness natural existences feelings desires aims whether out own 
or  other  peoples  becomes  unessential  only  the  pure  conscious 
thought  that we  put into  them  counts  The Stoic  selfconsciousness 
is  indifferent to the masterslave distinction  whether on the  throne 
of the world like Marcus Aurelius or in the slaves chains of Epictetus 
it withdraws  into  the  solitary sovereignty  the  pure  universality  of 
thought Such a withdrawal is characteristic ofa period in which high 
culture goes with universal  fear  and bondage 

  The  pure  Ego of Stoicism though not devoid  of content  is 
inwardturned whatever its content and hastherefQre an abstract incid
difference to natural being which it leaves to take its own course The 
freedom  of such Stoicism is  not  therefore  a  living  contentful freecid
dom  but the mere idea of such freedom  drawn away from life  and 
things into itself  This means  that  unless  content is  externally given 
to  this consciousness it cannot by itself determine  the  True and  the 
Good  It has no criterion other than the wholly  empty  abstract one 
of the  reasonable  a  notion as  tedious  as  it is  superficially  elevated 
  The Stoic consciousness  may negate particular content  but 

it altogether fails  to negate this negation ie  to appropriate such concid
tent to itself The specificity of its contents still falls outside of its thinkcid
ing essence 

  Scepticism  carries  into  realization  what  Stoicism  merely 

ANALYSIS 

notionally thinks  It explicitly negates  the rich  determinate content 
of life  and action  All  tasks  and  all  desires  become  for  it  vanishing 
quantities 

  Scepticism  carries  to  the  limit  the  dialectic  which  has  been 
sapping  Sensecertainty  Perceptual  acquaintance  Understanding 
and the masterserf relationship a dialectic which has steadily elimicid
nated determinateness from OUf thinking and left us with empty sciencid
tific  abstractions from  the last of which  we  now  withdraw  OUf  crecid
dence 

  Scepticism does  not  regretfully see  the solid  world  of reality 
going up in  the flames  nor even its  own perception of that world  it 
does  not  even  repine  at  the  sacrifice  of its  professional  sophistries 
which have framed the bonfire In seeing all this vanish it has become 
confirmed in  the consciousness of its  own freedom  from  conviction 
in the simple  negativity of its own  thinking 

f  This sceptical freedom  from  determinate  conviction  is  also 
however a giddy whirl of disorderly  ever dissolving  ever reinstated 
personal beliefs  The sceptic in fact confesses  that as  a finite  contincid
gent  empirical person  he is  everlastingly subject to  many  definite 
unjustifiable convictions Hehas to continue with the businessofordicid
nary living  acting and speaking  HeosciHates continually  between 
the high detachmentofuniversal scepticism and a weher of unreasoncid
able heliefs  Even his  pure scepticism is  a  thesis  for  which  doubtful 
arguments  are  adduced  and he must  in  practice  rely  on  the  delicid
verancesof the senses and the conven dons of morali ty  The sceptical 
selfMconsciousnessisin fact deeply selfcontradictory  and its  reasoncid
ings and counterreasonings are like  the arguments  of children concid
cerned to contradict one  another and always  to  have the  last word 
  Scepticism is selfcontradictory but unaware orits innerselfa 

contradiction  Its  truth  is  a  consciousness  which  makes  selfconcid
tradiction  its  explicit principle  which  is  always  conscious  of itself 
both  as selfsame  unchangeable  and free  and  as  confused  variable 
and distorted  In it both the magisterial and the servile elements are 
present in  uneasy unity  This  new  emergentconsclousness  is  called 
the  Unhappy Consciousness 

  This  Unhappy Consciousness  essentially  moves  towards  the 
accomplished goal of Spirit which involves the vision of one selfgcon  
sciousness in another For the Unhappy Consciousness however  this 
goal  is  remote  and  impliciu  its  two  sides  are  always  being  forced 
together in  unity  only  to  fall  painfully apart 

B  The Unhappy Consciousness separates its  unchangeableness 
from  its  variability and  regards  the former  as  exclusively  essential 
the latter as wholly unessential Being an unhappy divided consciouscid
ness  it identifies  itself with  the  unessential  changeable element  but 

IV  THE  TRUTH  OF SELFCERTAINTY  

 

it cannot help having  the  unchangeable element as  its  true essence 
I t  is  therefore in  the  paradoxical position of having its  true  essence 
outside of itself  and for  ever trying  to  be what from  another point 
of view  it essentially  is 

  The Unhappy Consciousness cannot unite itself with its  uncid

changeable  essence  without  importing  changeableness  into  that 
essence  and so  starting a  fresh  cycle  of struggle and  misery 

  In this  movement various  identifications  and separations  of 
unchangeable essence and variable nonessence occur which suggest 
the  triune  Persons  of Christian  theology  There  is  a  consciousness 
suggestive of the infinitely transcendent Father which rejects the varicid
able nonessence from the unchangeable essence There is  also a concid
sciousness  suggestive  of the  Son  which  accepts  something  in  the 
realm of unessential  variability as  an embodiment  an  outer shape 
of the unchangeable essence There is also a consciousness of the Spirit 
as  reconciling  the  eternal  essence  with  the  changeable  nonessence 
in  a  deeply joyful manner 

 L  These  identifications  and  separations  are  for  us  part  and 
parcel of the unchangeable essence itselfwhich is notdirempted as the 
Unhappy Consciousness sees it  But for  the  Unhappy Consciousness 
itself they are merely appearances which it attributes to the unchangecid
able consciousness  and whic are all hopelessly  beyond itself 

  For  the  Unhappy  Consciousness  having  thus  turned a 
necessary relationship into a contingentcoincidence forgets  its  own 
relationto the Unchangeable and only considers  its  relation  to  the 
remote pastspecificationofthe eternal essence  It is with this remote 
past specification  the  historic  Christ  that it  must  become  united 
  The  unessential  consciousness  strives  to  unite  itself  to  its 

embodied Transcendent in threefold fashion  a  asa pure consciouscid
ness  b  as  an  individual  with  wants  and  work  to  perform  c  as 
conscious  of its beingforself 

   As regards  a  the embodied Transcendent seems to the pure 
consciousness  to  be  posited  as  it is  for  itself  But its  transcendence 
means that its  present revelation is  necessarily  imperfect  and refers 
a  perfect revelation  to  the  distant future 

  The Unhappy Consciousness is itself the  bridge between the 
unchangeable  and  the changeable consciousness  But it does  not as 
yet see  itself as  such  a  bridge 

   I ts  relation  to  the  Unchangeable  is  therefore  not  one  of 

explicit  thought  Denken  but of implicit  thought  or  devotion  Ancid
dacht  It thinks of its  Unchangeable musically  or by way of clouds 
ofincense as a saving union of pure thought with individuality which 
lies for  ever beyond  itself  and which it can only yearn towards  Its 
feeling essence lies for ever outside the notional essence it adores  and 

ANALYSIS 

it can only lay hold of its unessential externals Only the grave of the 
divinity can be penetrated the divinity itself eludes it Only by giving 
up the search for  the ideal in the actual world  our  nonHegelian use 
of actual  can it hope  to find  it 

  I   The Unhappy Consciousnesss relation to its embodied Transcid

cendent  appears  further  as  its  own  selffeeling  connected  with  its 
desires  and  the  work it performs  This desire and  this  work  do  not 
however  give  its  existence  positive  meaning  make  it  confident  of 
itself enable it to enjoy the Transcendent All that they bring to light 
are the Unhappy Consciousnesss infinite remoteness and separation 
from  its  ideal 

  What the Unhappy Consciousness works upon is given as ha vcid

ing two sides like  the  Consciousness  itself  In one of them  it belongs 
to  the  Unchangeable in another to  the  realm of variability 

QO  For the  Unhappy Consciousness its abilities are not really its 
own nothing whose exercise can give it personal satisfaction all are 
gratuitous  gifts  from  the  Unchangeable 

  The  activities  of the  Unhappy  Oonsciousness are  given  as 
being as  much products of the  Unchangeables free  grace as  are the 
passive  reactionsofthe  things it works  upon 

  The  Unhappy  Consciousness  only  feels  one  with  the  Uncid

changeable when it adopts an attitude fboundlessgratitudetowards 
it  But even  this  attitude separates  it from  the  Unchangeable  and 
confirms  iliD its  unhappy distance 

  Oonsciousnessmust however return to itselfout of its feelcid

ing and its work and in this  return it is conscious of itself as  simply 
nought and null in the sight of its  Transcendent 

  The Unhappy Consciousness affirms its nullity by discovering 
sin alienation from  the Unchangeable in its most trivial activities 
and in brooding continually on its  own sinfulness 

  But in its sinfulness it is always necessarily directed to the Un 

changeable  and would  not otherwise feel  itself as sinful 

  Its relation to the Unchangeable is therefore necessarily medicid
ated for it by a  third priestly consciousness which brings it into harcid
mony with  its  ideal 

  The  Unhappy  Oonsciousness  surrenders  all  the fruits  of its 
personal  work  and  enjoyment  and  accepts  the  direction  of  this 
mediating priestly consciousness  in  all  things 

  Only  by  the  complete sacrifice  of all  decisions  and  undercid
standing to this mediating consciousness can the UnhappyOonsciouscid
ness  achieve  union  with  the  Unchangeable 

  It is  the absolving act of the intermediary consciousness  that 

must release the Unhappy Consciousness from its sinful schism estabcid
lish  its  oneness  with  the  Unchangeable  This  absolution  still  has  a 

V  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON    

tinge of unhappy externality but it is  in  principle a  consciousness of 
the universal positive rational mind overcoming and superseding the 
alienated  personal one  Implicitly  though  not fully  it has  now  the 
consciousness of being in all its  particularity inherently and essenti

V  THE  CERTAINTY AND  TRUTH OF  REASON 

 I  Consciousness in the experience of absolution has risen to  the 
realization that the individual consciousness is implicitly one with the 
Absolute  Essence which  is  however  still  placed  essentially  beyond 
itelf  In this realization selfconsciousness has been projected into the 
world of objects  into  the realm of being  and it has  also  identified 
itself with the universal It has become the middle term in a syllogism 
which reconciles the individual with the unchangeable universal and 
which  thereby sees  itself as  all  truth 

  Hitherto  in  Stoicism  etc  consciousness  has  adopted  a 
purely negative attitude  to  the world and  to  its own  actuality in it 
and has sought  to  save its  pure essence  from  both  Now  as  Reason 
sure of itself  it  tranquilly sees  all  reality  objective and subjective 
as no other than itself I thas achieved the position of idealism Having 
done away with graves and abolished abolitions it sees  the  world as 
its  own new  actual world  as  its  own  truth  and  presence  which  it 
wishes  to see  maintained in being and not vanish away 

  Reason is  consciousnesss  certainty  of being all  reality  this 
is  the essential  Notion  of idealism  For  Reason  the  Egos  object is 
neitheremptily general nor one object among others it is an Ego which 

ANALYSIS 

excludes  anything  taken  as  other  than  itself  It can  however  only 
be all  reality for  and in itself in so  far as  it shows  itself to  be  such 
and  this  ithas done  in  the  dialectical  development from  sensecercid
tainty to the Unhappy Consciousness Only in the light of this history 
this  experience  is  the  liq uidation  of otherbeing and  the  pure  cercid
tainty of Reason intelligible For the reasonable consciousness this cercid
tainty is a fact but it is not an explicitly formulated or comprehended 
fact 

  An idealism which merely asserts this certainty All the world 
is my idea without going through the relevant dialectical preparation 
can neither explain nor understand itself  Its certainty always stands 
over against other certainties  that  the  dialectical journey abolishes 
The certainty of my rational ego always stands over against the cercid
tainty  of something  else  existing  alongside  myself  The  dialectical 
preparation  establishes  idealism  as  the  only  truth  but  only  in  a 
general  abstract form  which  will  have  to  be  given  concreteness in 
various  actual sorts of confrontation 

  The rational consciousness here considered is  merely the catecid
gory  ie  the  wholly  general  formal  certainty  that  what  is  is  for 
thought and wha tis forthough t issefconsciousness and being are 
given as being one and the same essence Itisa mereconfUsion when 
another beinginitself the Kantian noumenon is postulated as being 
beyond  beingforthought  The categorial consciousness  in question 
must however  be such  as  intrinsically  to specify itself ina number 
of distinct categories forming a complete system as in  the Logic  to 
derive these categories fromanexternalsource eg the forms of judgecid
ment is  a disgrace  to  philosophy 

  The categoriaLcertalnty in  question  not only specifies  itself 
in a system of categories bu talso includes in itselfa pure or schematic 
reference  to individuals  though individual things are no part of the 
categoriaLframework  individual thinghood is part of it 

  Consciousness  essentially  moves  around  among  its  various 
moments seeing the  universal from the angle of the species and vice 
versa  Consciousness  is  this  perambulation  and  what it sees  on  this 
course 

  The first simple form of the idealistic  consciousness  is  the 
consciousness  that  all  I  deal  with  is  mine  my  own  idea  Such  an 
empty  appropriation leaves  all  detailed  content  to  experience  and 
foreign  intervention  It passes  to  and from  its  empty  proclamation 
of ownership to  foreign  material and  in  fact  oscillates like  the concid
sciousness of scepticism  It has no power to generate specific content 
in and by itseJf and  thereby condemns itself to the perpetual phenocid
menalism  of  Kantianism  Such  an  Idealism  is  selfcontradictory 
because abstract  It says  Reason  is  all  reality  but does  not show  it 

V  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON    

concretely at work  in  the  world  it req uires  a  further  carrying out 
to  be a  true idealism 

OBSERVING  REASON 

  The consciousness for which what is is  its own now turns  to 
sensecertainty  perception  etc  not  to  deal with something merely 
other  but in  the  certainty of being that other  Formerly it happened 
tonotice and experience much now it actively determines what it shall 
observe and experience  I t seeks  in  the world only  its  rational  con 
ceptual self  its  own infinitude 

  At first it merely divines its presence in the world but proceeds 
thereupon  to  take  possession  of its  inheritance  to  plant  the  ensign 
of its sovereignty on every  height and  depth  There  must be no  dif 
ferentiation of the real in which it does not discover itself and its idea 
of itself must develop as  it  proceeds  in such discovery 

  The observant consciousness  professes  to  be finding  out  the 
essence of things not of itself  while it is  Reason  it  does  not dearly 
know itself to  be Reason  To do so it must plumb its  own depths see 
itself as  through  and through  conceptual  notional  I t  can  then  in 
transformingthe slperficitl sensuous  being  of things  into  Notions 
recognize  itself in such Notions 

  Observation is concerned with Nature with Spirit and with 

the relation  between them  These three must be studied in  turn 

OBSER VATION  OF  NATURE 

  The unthinking consciousness treats observation and expericid

ence as  the source of truth butJorgets that the object of observation 
is  as important as  the mere act of seeing  hearing  etc  and that not 
every  perceived  content  counts  as  observed  eg  that  this  penknife 
is next to this snuffhox What is  observed must be more than a  mere 
particular  it must instantiate a  universal   
t  The universal of observation at first  merely  stays  the  same 
its movement is a  mere recurrence of selfsameness  The Understandcid
ing must try to btjngdifference into this selfsameness through descripcid
tion a  procedure never short of material  But it encounters a  Gheck 
when  it  begins  to  wonder  whether  it  is  not  describipg  something 
merely  accidental  unworthy  of description  and  lacking  in  generic 
meaning 

  Observation and description are now urged by an obscure incid

stinct of reason to distinguish between the essential and the accidental 
characters of objects  and  to  make of the former  not  merely  marks 
through which we  distinguish  them  but marks  through which  they 
distinguish  themselves  This  is  successfully  done  in  zoology  where 
claws  teeth  etc  are  the  very  organs  through  which specific  being 

ANALYSIS 

 
is  sustained  less  successfully  in  botany  and  still  less  successfully  in 
the  case  of  inorganic  substances  whose  description  changes  in 
changed circumstances 

  The difficulties of borderline vagueness and confusion are encid
demic to the interrelations of species and threaten to  reduce observacid
tion  to  unthinking description 

  An instinct of Reason however drives the  bserving consciouscid
ness  to look for a  law governing the  transitions  between specific  decid
scriptions 

  The  observing  consciousness  sees  such  laws  as  sensuously 
present in  the  particulars it observes which would  however  make 
them merely contingent and not genuine laws  at all  A  universal of 
Reason  will  however  retain its  notional  universality  even  if it decid
scends  into  the  being  of sensuous  thinghood  Those  thinkers  eg 
Fichte  are wrong  who  make laws  merely  patterns  to  which  things 
ought  to  conform 

  The observing consciousness does not take a law to  be a  unicid

versal of Reason  but sees  in  it something external and foreign  But 
it denies this foreignness when it refuseseg  to identify  gravitation 
with the actual falling behaviour orall bodies Itls content to observe 
bodies falling  in  a  large  number  of cases  and  to  infer  analogically 
that this  must happen in others  What is  inferred remains  probable 
and never becomes an observed fact It is  only when falling  is  made 
part of the  Notion  of a  heavy  body  i its  relation  to  the  earth  that 
a  law enters  the field  of the observable 

  Since a law is  a  Notion implicit an instinct of Reason seeks 

to purify it into a Notion explicit It sets up experiments which elimicid
nate the irrelevant and highlight the essential While seeming to sink 
deeperintosensuous particularity such experiments really cut off the 
Notion from the latter We soon arrive at freestanding matters  eg 
positive and negative electricity which are neither bodies nor propercid
ties  of bodies 

  A  matter eg  heat or calorie is  not an existent thing  but 
  an  existent  universal  or  instance  of notional  being  An  instinct  of 
Reason rightly draws  us  to such  matters since laws  being general 
and  nonsensuous  necessarily  connect  universals  things  not  sencid
suous  though given  in what js  sensuous  and  incorporeally  present 
in  bodies 

  The truth of the observable is  accordingly something present 
in sensuous being but also free to move about in it and in all change 
preserving its  notional simplicity  What is  implicit in such a  Notion 
then renders itself explicit in a  new sort of object whose observation 
constitutes a  new sort of observation 

  An  object  explicitly  embodying  the  Notions  shifting  sim

V  THE  CERTAINTY AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON     

plicity is an organic object Such an object embodies an absolute fluidcid
ity in which  all  external relations  vanish  Inorganic objects  depend 
on other objects to bring out and to complete what they are and get 
lost  in  their  ramifying  relations  towards  such  objects  But  organic 
objects despite their openness to external influence are not essentially 
related  to  what is  external  and  in  all  relations  preserVe  their  unity 
and simplicity 

  An  instinct  of  Reason  seeks  to  discover  laws  connecting 
features in the organism with features  in the inorganic environment 
thereby  reducing  the  externality  and  contingency  in  which  such 
features  stand  to  one  another  Such  laws  do  not  however  explain 
the richness  of organic being  and  never  pass  beyond  talk  of great 
influences to exceptionless necessities Their teleological explanations 
remain  external and are  therefore  the very antithesis of laws 

  The  observing  consciousness  never  goes  beyond  external 
teleology  to  the  true  teleology  of organic  nature  which  is  Natures 
embodiment of the Notion In true teleology we do not have one factor 
passively produced by another but a single nature realizing itself and 
sustaining its  own reality 

  Teleological  processes  may  seem  to  be  provoked  by  incid

different  external  circumstances  which  therefore  seem  to  have 
explanatory priority In reality however the circumstances make no 
difference to the outcome of which the true ground is  the End itself 
This End feels  itself in  the final  satisfaction 

  The relation of the teleological organism to external circumcid

stance  is  analogous  to  the  relation  of selfconsciousness  to  external 
reality As the hungry animal assimilates its food so selfconsciOllsness 
understands external objectivity  and makes  it its  own  But since  it 
first  does so  instinctively  its  satisfaction seems  doubled  it is felt  by 
itself but is also referred to a sort of blind understanding in the object 
  An organism conceals  the relation of its  manifest actions  to 
their immanent aim and so  seems  to  have  been  constructed  by an 
outside  intelligence  Just so  Reason  conceals  the  inner  necessity  of 
its own proceedings andJocates it in the objects  that it is  studying 
In both cases there is a distinction which is really no distinction teleocid
logy  is  in  the organism and Reason in  the  thing studied 

  The individual performances of an organism in furtherance 
of its  own  maintenance  and  that  of its  species  are  not  observed  to 
have  a  necessary  relation  to  these  purposes  though  they  in  fact 
have it 

  The selfdifferentiating unity of organic teleology is not obsercid

vationally  but notionally  grasped    bserva tion  therefore  converts 
it into  the interplay of distinct factors  which  suits  its  thoughtstyle 
  The organism therefore appears to observation to have an in

  
ner teleological core and an outer actual crust  the latter being the 
expression of the former  The Notion  here expires  in a  picture 

ANALYSIS 

  Neither inner purpose  nor outer expression  nor their  unity 
of essence  are  more  than formally  distinct  we  do  not  have  a  con 
nection between genuinely distinct terms Observation recognizes this 
in  talking oCa mere  expression 

  Observational picturethought must none the less  externalize 

its  formal  distinction of outer and inner 

  Observation finds  internal teleology in the  unresting fluidity 
of the soul while its outer actuality is found in the quiescent external 
organism  It conceives of the  relations  between  these  two  factors  in 
three basic organic properties at once essences and patterns of intercid
action  These are the sensibility  irritability and reproduction  only 
fully  found  among animals 

  Sensibility is  simply  the organisms reference  of all  to  itself 
its taking of all into its own fluidity while irritability is its answering 
reaction to what invades it a  reaction which affects what is external 
as much as itself Reproduction finally is the organisms main tenance 
of its own pattern in the constant renewal of parts  by  the  individual 
and in the generation ofever new individuals AU  three functions stem 
from  the  organismS concern with itselfas its  own sole  End 

  The outwardly actual form of sensibility is the nervous system 
that  of irritability  the  muscular  system  that  of reproduction  the 
viscera 

  There are peculiar organic laws connecting our  three funccid

tions  both as  regards external structure and fluid  inner  character 
The latter also  has  its external side 

  The laws connecting the outer and inner aspects of the organcid

ism  elude  observation  not  because  the  latter  is  shortsighted  but 
because such laws  lack all  truth 

  Sensibility is  not a  function  confined  to  the  nervous  system 
nor separable from reactivity or irritability The latter is  inseparable 
fromsensibility  and both enter into organic selfmaintenance or recid
production Hence laws connecting such factors must be spurious 

 I  Sensibility etc are qualitatively distinct aspects When made 
into the terms of an empirical law they are credited with quantitative 
differences  and are said  to  vary inversely or directly  It is  as  if one 
made  a  law  of  the  tautology  that  a  hole  increases  as  its  filling 
diminishes or as  more and more stuff is  removed  from  it 

  Such laws have nothing to do with sensibility and irritability 

but are mere cases  of a  logical  truism 

  Since reproduction is not opposed to either sensibility or irrit 
ability there is  even less  reason  to  look  for  a  law connecting it with 
either 

v  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TRUTH OF  REASON gS   

  The laws in question are really tautologies which  have been 
given a false  appearance of actual  existence  Their  outward  shapes 
do not really  differ from  their  inward presence 

  Organic functions  studied  as  observable  existences  obey  no 
governing laws but range over every chance magnitude eg the Xs 
greatly prefer this sort offood to  that  they have this or that number 
of offspring so  many  times  a  year  etc 

  There are no clear relations between vague functions like sencid

sibility etc  and the structured systems revealed by  anatomy  which 
are  much  more  numerous  than the functions  in  question  Anatomy 
reveals  only dead structures  never  their living  use 

  The various functions  distinguished in organic being cannot 
be regarded as distinct existents externally related They are pervasive 
aspects of one  lifeprocess 

  There is  therefore no place for laws in the treatment of organcid

isms  they cannot be broken into separate determinations  united by 
bonds which determine each differently Organic being is always discid
solving all separate determinations 

  When the Understanding discovers laws  connecting existent 
aspects of Nature it is  itself the connecting factor among those sides 
it does not as yet see them as part of the object But in the observation 
of life  the interconnection ofaspects is itself objective  We no  longer 
have the merely existent aspects between which a law could  be found 
to  hold 

  If we  seek  to  consider  organic  existence  in  and for  itself  it 
loses all precise character and becomes almost indefinitely variable 
The necessity of the  Notion vanishes  altogether 

  The  observational  consciousness  while  rising  above  mere 
Understanding in its trealmen t oflife  always relapses into the manner 
of the Understanding  treating aspects  as  fixed  determinations  and 
relating them quantitatively in what it would like to consider as laws 
  The observational consciousness tries to rise above perceived 
sensuous differences by using germanized Latin names for  potencies 
and faculties  to  which varying degrees  are  then attributed  It does 
not  thereby  genuinely  rise  above  the senses 

  We have  now  to  consider the organisms outer aspects 
  The  organism  externalizes  itself  into  structures  essentially 

related to the inorganic environmentthe object opposed to its beingcid
forselfbut in ways  not capable of being brought under strict laws 
  The actual organism is  at once turned towards  the  beingincid

itself of the object and also towards its own beingforself In the latter 
respect  it  is  free  selfdetermining  and  indifferent  to  the  definite 
shapes it assumes  it is  a  stream  which  does  not  care  what  mills  it 
drives  This inner side of the actual organism can be  expressed  only 

 

ANALYSIS 

in  the  nonsensuous  determinateness of number sensuous  qualities 
the  lifestyle  of the organism  are  the  outer  aspect  of such  number 
  The inner side of the  actual organism  has  therefore  itself an 
inner and an outer aspect  the former  the  restless  variability  of the 
essentially  abstract  the  latter  the  nonsensuous  determinateness  of 
number  in which  all  movement and  relation  to  the  sensuous  have 
been  eliminated 

  Such an abstract treatment of the organism however reduces 
it to  the inorganic which has  its  essence outside of itself in  the self  
conscious  thinker  We must  treat  the  organism in  its  own  concrete 
sphere 

  Specific gravity is in the concrete the internal aspect of the incid

organic  thing  expressible  in  terms of numerical measures  revealed 
by com paring observa tions and underlying the things colour hardcid
ness  and other sensuous  properties 

  Specific gravity  is  not  however  selfdifferentiating  and so 
not involved in process except quantitatively It is  therefore only concid
tingently connected with the multitude of properties that it underlies 
In this  respect it falls short of cohesion which involves differences of 
stateandconseq uent transitions from one sta te to another  Cohesion 
however only abstractly achievesselfdifferentiation in the imperfect 
form  of changes in specific gravity  degree of specific gravity  is  not 
systematically connected with degree of cohesion 

  The many other properties of inorganic bodies have nonecescid

sary connection with their specific gravity or cohesion and can only 
be classified in numerical terms ie unessentially We cannot discover 
general quantitative principles  underlying the various types of propcid
erty  whether severally or as  a  whole 

  The relation of inner to  outer is  however  quite  different in 
the case of organisms  In  the inorganic what is  internal is  a  definite 
numerical measure quite indifferent to sensuous manifestations but 
the organism contains  a  principle of sensuous  differentiation  within 
itset  Its internality takes  the form of a  natural genus or kind which 
has the power to determine itselfin various alternative ways  whereas 
the  internality  of specific  gravity  has  one  definite  property  correcid
sponding to each of its degrees 

  The universality  of the genus  is  inherently such as  to  reveal 
itself in  alternative individual ways  But between  the  universal  and 
the individual the determinate universal or species necessarily has its 
place  When a  process from  the  universal  to  the  individual  via  the 
species takes place we  have  a  case  of consciousness  in an inorganic 
being it does  not occur as  a  process  but only as  an outcome  In this 
outcome the universal is represented by a series of numbers over which 
the individual freely varies Only ifan individual could transcend the 

V  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TR UTH  OF  REASON  c   

limits  of such individuality  could  he  achieve  consciousness  Being 
conscious is  only logically different from  being a  case  of a  species  or 
genus in a case of consciousness universality moves through specificity 
towards  individuality  in  unconscious  individuality  there  is  no 
detached universality and no movement towards individuality only 
the sort of fusion which might have been  the outcome of such a  movecid
ment 

  Generic universality differentiated specificity and individual 
singularity  are  the  three  syllogistic  terms  which  by  their  inter  
relations explain organic and inorganic being  Hegels dynamic Placid
tonism 

  The pure genus specifies itself into a set of sorts systematically 
ordered  by  quantitative  differences  But  the  individuation  of these 
species is  determined in part by the  universal individual  the  Earth 
which contingently determines just where  and  to  what extent  parcid
ticular species  will  be individually instantiated 

  In  the  case  of selfconscious  man  the  specific  forms  of concid
sciousness cons titu te an ordered line of development a necessaryspiricid
tual history Organic nature has no such history it falls straight from 
pure  universality into the  brute singularity of existence 

  Organic Nature only actualizes such  of its  specific  forms  as 

 the individuality of Earth permits 

  Observing Reason dealing with organic Nature can therefore 

never rise above mere opinions which at best predicate great influcid
ences  and never achieve  the necessity  of laws 

OBSERV A TION  OF  sELFOONgCIO USNESS  IN  ITS  PURITY  AND  IN 
ITS  RELATION  TO  EXTERNAL  ACTUALITY  LOGIOAL  AND 

PSYCHOLOGICAL  LAWS 

  The  observation  of inorganic  Nature  finds  the  Notion  split 
into a plurality of things which are nowhere bent back into simplicity 
or unity Organic Nature involves such a simplicity which does not 
however distinguish its  moments  clearly  Only in selfconsciousness 
is singularity held apart from universality yet absolutely held fast in 
the  latter 

  The  Laws  of Thought  are  the  first  discoveries  of obsercid
va tiona I  consciousness  turned  inward  on  itself  They  are  formal 
expressions  of the  relations  between  aspects  of the  Notion  Being 
formal  they are not set over against  the  content which  would  give 
them  truth  and reality  but their form  none the less  includes an incid
trinsic  reference  to  such content 

  The Laws of Thought are given to observational consciouscid
ness  as  a set of existent  contents  which  it  merely  finds  there  As  so 
conceived they are not so  much empty forms as  unformed materials 

ANALYSIS 

whose  role  in  thought  is  not  as  yet  determined  This  role  will  be 
studied in our speculative system 

  The observational consciousness dcs not closely connect the 
Laws of Thoughf with the action of consciousness of real materials 
I t therefore fails  to identify the principles immanent in thinking with 
the same principles  used  to overcome  the otherness of the  materials 
thinking deals  with 

  The  varying  reactions  of consciousness  to  what  it sees  as  a 
merely other found reality are the theme of a  new set of laws  those 
of  psychology  These  laws  concern  the  effort  of consciousness  to 
accommodate its  individuality  to  the  ways  of objective  things  but 
also  to accommodate objective things to its own needs and passions 
and thereby to sacrifice its detached universality The former  cognicid
tive  laws  merely  give  reality  the  universality  of  consciousness 
whereas the latter  practical laws  show  us  reality  modified  to  suit 
the  personal self  and  that  perhaps in a  criminal  or revolutionizing 
manner 

gog  Observational psychology never gets  past  regarding  mental 

faculties dispositions etc as a ragbag ofdisconnecteciitems wondercid
fully  churning about in a  single container 

  InJreatingall these items separately or as  united only in the 
actual  individual  it  fails  to  notice  the  overarching  universality  of 
Spirit  Its  pronouncements  regarding  differences  in  intelligence 
propensities  etc  are  for  that  reason  even  Jess  valuable  than 
enumerations of the contingent differences of mosses insects etc 

g  The  laws  looked  for  by  observation  involve  some  specific 
individual on  the one hand  and the environing natural and social 
circumstances  on  the  other  both  of which  are  conceived  as  given 
particulars 

  But such an endeavour forgets that the individual having the 

universal in him can freely take up different stances towards circumcid
stances and influences  and  that he reflects  as  if in  an  inner gallery 
thesamegeneralarra yofcircumstances thatplay upon him in the world 
  What the world is for the individ ual depends on his own active 
or passive  response  to  it  Hence  no  clear  meaning  can  be  given  to 
the psychological  necessity  that the  world imposes on him 

B  Since environing world and responding individual cannot be 
neatly separated there can be no laws connecting one with the other 

OBSERVATION  OF  TIiE  RELATION  OF  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS  TO 

ITS  IMMEDIATE  ACTUALITY  PHYSIOGNOMY  AND 

PliRENOLOGY 

  Since  the environing worJd  has  been made  part of selfconcid
scious individuality observation must now make the latter its object 

V  THE  CERTAINTY AND TRUTH  OF REASON    

  In such individuality the  existent body is  the  individualitys 
beinginself just as its activity is its beingforself  The body cannot 
however be merely external to the individuals activity but must in 
some  manner express  its  determining character 

  I  The  lawgoverned  relation  of individuality  to  environment 
has now been transferred into the expressive relation ofa mans bodily 
shape to his consciousness and movement We have now  to elucidate 
this  expressive  relation 

  An expression at once goes beyond what it expresses by fulfilcid

ling and completing it  but it also  falls  short  of it  by  lending itself 
to  distortion  by circumstances  by an  individuals clumsiness  or by 
his inten tion to deceive We must therefore look for some more reliable 
sign of an individuals inwardness than  the  use  of his  bodily organs 
 I   Such a sign must be neither an organ nor an action but some 
quiescent  feature  of bodily  structure  arbitrarily  and  contingently 
related to some inward individual  peculiarity 

  The  wouldbe  science  of physiognomy  wants  to  make  such 
a  contingent  relation  into  a  law  connecting  inner  with  outer  and 
claims in this to be superior to astrology and palmistry which merely 
connect one externaLthing with another 

  Palmistry can however claim to use the hand in which after 
the tongue a mans individuality is above all manifest as  the initself 
of a  man on which his fate and fortune  depend 

  Though the condition ora mans organs of speech manipulacid

tion etc  is in a sense external to his inward disposition  yet it is  less 
external than  the actions  its  brings about  and is  in fact  the middle 
term from which  these follow  as  conclusions 

 I    This middle term covers not only what is  done by  the  organ 
mainly  involved  but  by  other  expressive  movements  and  stances 
which reveal  the individuals inwardness  to himself and others 

   Expressive movements differ from deeds and can be used  to 
test the seriousness of the latter But they too are contingently related 
to  the  inwardness of which  they  are  the sign and can  like  a  mask 
be  laid aside  and replaced 

 Observation identifies what is  inner with a  mans intentions 
rather than his actions the latter are fOT  it the inessential expressions 
oftheformer It then looks for something observable which will correcid
spond  to  these inward intentions 

  Physiognomy does not differ in principle from the unscientific 
gaugingofa mans character from the way he looks and acts It makes 
little difference that it speaks in terms of capacities and propensities 
and does not merely call someone a murderer ora thief  The indivicid
duals in exh a us tible na ture cannot be set forth in terms of such ca pacicid
ties  and  propensities 

 

ANALYSIS 

  The laws which such a science enunciates are based on percid

sonal  associations  and  opinions  like  the  housewifes  law  that  it 
always  rains  when  the washing is  out to  dry 

  Whenever deeds conflict with physiognomic expressions they 
answer the questions raised by such expressions  What we do stamps 
us  as  murderers  heroes  etc  Deeds  can of course  go  awry or fail  of 
their purpose but where they are on target and persist uncorrected 
they  are  not  mere signs  but the  thing itself 

  Physiognomy  improves  psychology  by  substituting  for  the 
provocative environment the individuals own expressive movements 
Physiognomy must now be improved by substituting for such movecid
ments  something fixed  thinglike  and immobile 

  Since both inward and outward have their own beinginself 
their relation  to  each other mllst now  take  the  form  of an  external 
causal  action 

  The inward conceived as  self  related  yet active  in and  not 
indifferent  to  its  outgoing  manifestations  must  have  an  actual 
existent Qrgan not merely instrumental which is active in such manicid
festations 

  The heart the liveretc are frequently conceived as the active 
centres and sourcesofcertinmanifestations They are not however 
first  sources  but rather halfway stations 

  The brain and spinal cord  minus  the nerves  represent the 
organisms pure selfconsciousness  not as  such outgoing  but at rest 
in itself  a  fluid  pool in which disturbances die  away  The diversity 
of bodily movements having their source in  this  consciousness  must 
however  be  represen ted inthis  uid  pool  which  must  accordingly 
he articulated into zones or regions 

  In the head the beingforselfofthe organism appropriately 
comes  to  a  head and that in  two  extreme forms  the  caput  vivens  or 
brain and the caput  mortuum  or skull  The skull  is  the  beingforself 
of the organism made in toa fixed inert thing The spinal cord merely 
conducts action to and from  the head and  there  are other channels 
for  this  as  well 

  Since brain and skull are both expressions of the organisms 
beingforself there is  necessarily an accommodation of the shape of 
the one to thatoftheother which we mayor may not like to conceive 
in terms of ca usal action of either on the other or beth on one another 
  There is  no  intelligible  connection  between  the  strength  or 
weakness  of spiritual faculties  and  the  bulging or contracted size  of 
regions  of the skull 

 I  For observation  the brain only counts as  the existent form of 

self  conscious  individuality  while  the skullbones  count as  its  existcid
enceforanother or as  a  mere  thing 

V  THE  CERTANTY  AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON     

  The manysidedness of Spirit necessarily expresses  itself in a 

geography of skullregions of differing significance 

  Skullbones do not express  mental states  in  the way changes 
of countenance do nor are they even signs of such mental states They 
reduce  all reference  to  self to  the  purest immediacy 

  Vaguely  localized  feelings  in  the  head  could  possibly  show 

what skullregions corresponded to what psychic tendencies eg murcid
derous poetic thieving etc Such diagnoses would however be quite 
ambiguous and indefinite 

  The propensities and capacities of the mind have to be pared 
down  to  a  few  ossified  differences  to  be  arbitrarily  correlated  with 
the bumps and hollows of the skull  In such correlations a  collection 
of mental dry bones is correlated with an equally dry physical colleccid
tion 

  Anything  in  a  mans  disposition  can  be  correlated  with  a 
bump or hollow on his  skull  even  as  in  the  case  of a  cuckold  with 
a  bump or hollow on someone elses skull  Such conceptions are piccid
torial  without genuine notional possibility 

  If an individual does  not behave as  his  bumps  and  hollows 
suggest  one can always  attribute  such  deviations  to  his  exercise  of 
free will Bumps and hollows are only thefoundation for empty possicid
bilities  They never justify definite predictions 

  Such subterfuges  make  the skullbones  a  sign  of everything 

or nothing 

  Selfconsciousness cannot be made to depend on boneformacid
tionssince  Kuch  inert  existences  are  everything  of which  selfconcid
sciousness is  the negation A  man might prove  the absurdity of such 
a  reduction by simply smashiQg in someones  skull 

  Observation  finds  it  harder  to  see  through  such a  gross 
absurdity as mindskull identity as  to see  through much less flagrant 
absurdities  But the limit of the absurd is  here reached  and Reason 
must do an aboutturn  in  the pposite  direction 

  Retracing our path  we  see  how  we  moved  from  observing 
inorganic Nature to postulating nonsensible laws behind it this pure 
universality  conflated with  existent  sensible  objectivity  became  a 
new  object  the  organism  SUh  existent  sensible  objectivity  could 
not however be a true expression of such universality which accordcid
ingly  became a  detached  purposive  universality  Le  selfconsciouscid
ness  as  an  observed object 

  Selfconsciousness as an observed object at first specified itself 

in the Laws of Thought  treated as existent contingencies These difcid
ferentiations fused into a  unit became the individual selfconsciouscid
ness  which  necessarily  contained  and  related  an  outwardturned 
aspect of will  and action  to  an inwardturned selfconscious  aspect 

 
of which it was the sign  These two aspects were externally and concid
tingently  related 

ANALYSIS 

  Recognizing the relation ofinner and outer to  be contingent 
observation ceased to look for an organ a symbol of Spirit and pinned 
down its  external immediacy in a  dead Thing  The reality of Spirit 
was thereby made into a thing and inert being given the significance 
of Spirit To treat Spirit as  a  merely existent  objective thing is  cercid
tainly to  make it into something like  a  bone 

  This result had a twofold sense On the one hand it completed 
the  previous selfextrusion of selfconsciousness  which  we  saw  in  the 
Unhappy Consciousness its selfprojection into a  mere object which 
though  embodying  a  categoriaI  unity stemming from  its  own  concid
scious selfuood was seen as having a rationality that selfconsciousness 
could have  rather than he  Such merely had rationality was  typical  of 
the observer  he saw his  Reason out there  in  the  Thing  Such selfcid
projection of Reason couldnot however be sustained Selfconsciouscid
ness  necessarily fehits gaze reverting from  the rationalized object to 
its own rational activity  In this difficult paragraph the orderingunicid
versalitywhich can lead a detached life as the selfconsdous Ego is seen 
stretching out towards a specifiei ty and individuality which seemS to lie 
beyond itselfandinrelation to which itappearsas a set of objective 
categories  From this  selfseparation it comes to  the  realization that 
this ord eringuni versality  ca tegoriali y projec ted intoobj ects is the same 
as  the  ordering  universality  at  work  in  its  own  conscious  efforts 
  On the other hand our outcome is  simply  the identification 
of seWconsciousness  with  a sensible objective  thing  Selfconsciouscid
ness only hecomes real  in a  bone  Selfconsciousness in other words 
despite  its  systematic  elusiveness  mlJst  have  a  foothold  somewhere 
in  the crust of material  thinghood 

  What emerges from  the observational experience  is  that the 
pure universality of the Notion is  the ordering principle of the Thing 
that thinghood and Notion are the same  This cannot be  understood 
as  long as  we  treat Notion and Thing as  independent selfsubslstent 
realities  and  do  not see  the  former  as  selfdirempted  in  the  latter 
and so constituting an infinite judgement  The Notion is  no Thing 
is an infinite j udgemen t which in opposingN otion to  Thing  makes 
their whole  being consist in  their mutual relevance  As  long as  we 
look on them as  sundered  their opposition  remains  gross  and  crass 
it is  like  the  union of urination and orgasm in a single  organ 

THE  ACTUALIZATION  OF  RATIONAL  SELFCONSCIOUSNESS 

THROUGH  ITS  OWN  ACTIVlTY 

  The true significance of selfconsciousnesss selfrecogni tion In 
the external observed thing is its selfrecognition in another selfclbn

V  THE  CERTAINTY AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON    

sciousness  which  though  a  duplicate  of  itself  has  the  surface 
separateness from itself characteristic of a  thing  out there 

  Observational Reason ca tegorized the observed thing in ways 
corresponding to its own development from sensecertainty through 
perception  to  Understanding  It  went  that  is  from  description 
through classification to lawlike explanation Reason must now reca 
pitulate its further developmen t from individualistic selfassertion and 
conflict  to  the  ethical  selfcnsciousness  which  unites  all  selfcong 
sciousnesses  This  recapitulation  is  to  take  place  within  the  social 
medium ony implicit in Master and SJave etc and remote and alien 
in  the Roman and medieval worlds 

  The stage  of selfconsciousness  towards  which  we  are  now 
moving is essentially ethical governed by unwritten laws  and social 
customs a framework  within which  the individual lives and moves 
and from which he  does not think  to  disassociate himself 

  The members of an organized social whole not only resemble 
the  differentiated  modes  of a  single  substance  they  are  also  more 
or less conscious of their common membership of the sacrifice of their 
indiviclllal  toa generic identity 

  Theindividualincul organized social whole works for himself 
in  ways  prctised and  sanctioned  by  all  and  performedJor others 
as  much as for himself  His most independent efiortsare sanctioned 
and approved for  all  and entail a  thoroughgoing reciprocity in  his 
Tela tion  to  others 

  The cutoms of an organized society  have  both  the  opacity 
of external  thinghoodtnd  the  transparent selfidentity  of selfcong 
sciollsness  Onerealizes oneself mQst perfectly by  being  the  perfect 
embocUmeJt  of ones  commtmitys social norms 

  To live as  a  mere individual in an organized social whole is 
not however  to he explicitly conscious of ones identity with it  One 
may either have  forgotten  it  in  a  mere  taking for  granted  or  may 
not as yet have fully  acbieved it 

  The immediacyofethicallife is riot critical ofestablished laws 
and customs Much less does itconsciously alignitselfwith them and 
assert  their absolute standing 

  When  sdfconsciousindividuality  arises  the  bond  of trust 
which  ins  it with  the  social  unity  is  destroyed  The  individual 
opposes himself to social  laws  and customs 

  The  self  conscious  individual  withdrawing  from  the  social 

medium seeks to make his own Jlark in the world through his practicid
cal efforts  He seeks  to  fulfil  himself  to  achieve  personal  happiness 
  The fulfilment  which  the individual at this  stage  pursues  is 
the fulfilment  of his  own immediate will  and  natural  impulses  not 
the welfare of society  This individuaistic pursuit of satisfaction may 

 

ANALYSIS 

either precede or follow the full  development of the ethical consciouscid
ness  In the former case crude impulses are subordinated to the ethicid
caltife of custom in the latter case there is a  conscious abandonment 
of the life of mere  impulse  and an advance  to  the acceptance of an 
ethic made to fit the individuals own inward sense of morality Since 
the individualism most rampant in our own day is  of the latter sort 
it is  this  that we shall now consider 

  Selfconsciousness  which  has  risen  to  the  Notion  of Spirit 

now seeks  to  realize  itself in an individuals mind or person 

  Selfconsciousness  pledged  to  individual  selfrealization 
necessarily negates the selfrealization of other individuals and seeks 
to impose on all the negation ofaH ends but its own  This universally 
imposed selfrealization assume three forms  the  undisciplined  purcid
suit of pleasure the undisciplined law of the heart and the more discicid
plined  cult of virtue  These lead  ultimatey  to  the  onepointed self  
dedication  to  the  matter or task on hand 

PLEASURE  AND  NEOESSITY 

  Selfconsciousness sees  the existent objective thing  that concid
frontsitas implicitly itself  It seeks tomakewhatis implicit explicit 
and  to  reshape  the  objective  thing to satisfy  its  individual  self  All 
thehigherintellectual and ethical ends of the community are spurned 
and set aside 

 I  I t expresses its individuality in ilJmediate active living culcid
lingclelights where it finds them rather than creating them for itself 
I t  makes no  use  of laws  and general  principles 

  It does  not  seek  to  transform  existence  practically  but  to 

savour its surface  Its enjoyment centres principally on another selfcid
consciousness anembodimentofrational categories and laws which 
it does not however treat as such but as made for its own gratificacid
tion  thereby destroying  tpe  others rationality 

  Pleasure taken in anothers person for ones own gratification 

is  essentially selfdestroying  TheTational categories essential  to  percid
sonalityare bypassedand  there S  therefore nothing to  hold one  to 
an individual object There is  therefore a blind necessity driving one 
on to seek ever new objects in unending selffrustration This necessity 
is nothing but the expression of the sheeremptinss of what is  merely 
individual 

  The  pursuit of ones  own  satisfaction  therefore  passes  over 

frpmsheer individualism to an absolute universalismin which aU  incid
dividuality  is  shattered 

  What is  now pursued  by  the  individual assumes  the form  of 
a necessity a law which he cannotunderstand but to which he must 
unconditionally submit 

V  THE  CERTAINTY AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON    

  To surrender to a law is however to remove its alien characcid

ter  It will  become  the  individuals  own law 

THE  LAW  OF  THE  HEART  AND  THE  FRENZY  OF  SELFCONCEIT 

  The individuals satisfaction seen in the form of a law becomes 

the law of the  individuals own  heart 

  The individual must see whether his  true essence lies  in such 

a  law of the  heart 

  The law of the  heart necessarily opposes  itself to  the  law  of 
this world under which the individual and humanity live oppressed 
To the individual  the positive  worldly  law  is  something actual and 
found whereas we phenomenologists see  it as  the shadow cast by the 
law  of the  heart 

  The heartruled individual necessarily sees  his  undisciplined 
personal dictates as  pleasing to all  and himself as  noble in carrying 
them out 

S  I  Oppressed humanity does notseem to the heartruled individcid
ual  to  be  aware of its  oppression  by  thisworld  ordinances  or of its 
nQbility in  trallgressing them  This  dference to  external authority 
mgst  b brokeflwn  It is  merely  accidental  if authority  and  the 
heart agree 

  To  tbe  extent  that  the law  of the  heart  becomes  an  actual 
oqlinance thehearbruled individual must cease  to  find  satisfaction 
in it It is  no  longer  the Jaw  of his  heart  but something alien  and 
actual  against which his  heart must rehel  ToJulfil the hearts law 
is  therefore  also  to frustrate  it 

  Whatever  the  individual  chooses  to  do  will  through  such 
choice  conform to  the  law  of his  heart  But not every  individuafs 
heart will concur with the chosen course Other individuals will concid
demn what a mans heart dictates and will therefore become horrible 
in  his  sigh t 

  The individual who erects  the dictates of his heart into aJaw 
for aU  Gomes  tQseethat the actual law fQr  aU  is  not alien and  dead 
but a  genuine law for  all  hearts  even  though  the  individual  failed 
to  realize  this 

  The heartrYled  individual  therefore  becomes  a  living  concid

tradiction and reQgnizes  as  a  universaUyvalid  order  one  that he 
as  an individual loes  not wish  to  recognize 

  To  be  thus  torn  between  the  recognition  of a  universally 

intituted and a  personally chosen lawLs  to  be selfalienated  or incid
sane 

  The heart thus torn  madly fulminates against the priests and 
dspots who  have  imposed  their alien laws  on  humanity  But since 

ANALYSIS 

 
it itself wishes to be just such a priest and despot it comes to see itself 
as  being as  perverse  and  perverting as  these  are 

  It comes  to see  that a  universal  law  is  itself perverted  if it is 
merely seen as a law of all hearts as satisfying everyones selfish indivicid
duality 

  A law for all hearts necessarily becomes a  law  that all indivicid

duals fight  over  a  way  of the  world  that  never  achieves  a  stable 
agreed form 

 

  But to such a fluctuating way the ideal of a fixed agreed way 
of life necessarily opposes itself  the ideal of virtue as  opposed  to  the 
way of this  wold 

VIRTUE  AND  THE  WA Y  OF  THE  WORLD 

  Both virtue and the way of the world involve a  compromise 
between disinterested universality and individuality Only jn virtue 
individuality  sacrifices  itself to  standards  that  it  has  itself set  up 
whereas in the way of the world disinterested universality is realized 
through  the interaction and attrition of individuals 

  The way of the world is  the disinterested order which  arises 
out of the  interested actions  of countless  individuals  Though  concid
demned from  the emptily universal standpoint of virtue it is really 
what virtue seeks  to compass It is  not  however  a  blind  drift  but 
one  that  consciousness  can  understand  and  accept  even though 
it springs from  the mad selfassertion of individuals  Hegel extends 
the  principles  of laissezfaire  economics  to  all  human  andsodal 
action 

g  Virtue however  attempts  to  reverse  the  way  of the  world 

and  to  arrive at a  disinterested order through individual effort 

  Virtue  makes  its  direct  aim  what  the  way  of  the  world 
achieves by indirection The aim of virtue is  a  poor abstraction from 
what is  actually achieved  by  the way of the world 

  From the standpoint of virtue there are gifts  and  powers of 

whkh there is  a  right and noble use but which are abused and percid
verted  by  the wayoflhe world 

  But these gifts and powers are precisely  the substantive concid
tent  to  which  virtue  and vice  add  an  insubstantial  nuance  of difcid
ference  One cannot transform  the vicious into the virtuous without 
damaging such content  Hence the whole fight  between virtue  and 
vice becomes  a  mock  combat 

  The  way  of the  world  having  no  sacred  cause  to  defend 
always achieves great richness of content while virtue with its special 
preferences  remains  always in jeopardy 

  Virtue cannot overcome  the  way  of the world  by  making a 

V  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON    

cunning use of the latent good in it For the way of the world vigilantly 
fences  off such  interference  This  latent  good  is  either  something 
that virtue dare not  interfere with  or is  as  lacking in reality as  are 
the  gifts  and  powers  that  can  be  used  in  its  service  It  is  no  more 
than an imagined higher consciousness  behind  the actual natures of 
men 

  Virtue is overcome by the way of the world since virtue aims 
absurdly at abolishing  the individuality which is  the very  principle 
of actuali ty  The ideal of disin teres ted virtue is ei ther an empty word 
or it must achieve actuality by accepting actual men and their intercid
ests 

  Virtue  therefore  as  pposed  to  the  way  of the world  is  an 
emptily  rhetorical  unconstructive  form  of edification  which  may 
minister  to  mens vanity  but is  ultimately  boring  It is  not like  the 
virtue of antiq uity which accepted ethical existence  and only sought 
to  improve it 

J  When  boredom sets  in  men  drop an  ideal  of virtue  which 

uproots  the individuality  and  interest  essential  to  practical  realizacid
tion 

  The way of the world is  by the same movement brought  to 
vanish  Selfinterest ishetter  than  it  thinks  it is  in realizing itself 
it realizes  Ends  that are universal 

  The universaL End ofselfconscious life  cannot be separated 

from  the private  personal acts  and ends  of individuals 

INPIVIDUALITY WHICH  TAJES  ITSELF  TO  BE  REAL  IN  AND  FOR 

ITSELF 

  Self  consciousness  has  now  ceased  to  oppose  universal  gifts 
and powers  to  the individual employment of them  It is  subjectively 
certainof itselfin and through its individual acts which are its obJeccid
tive  truth alternatively  its  acts  provide  the subjective  certainty  of 
which its aims are the objective truth It has  become in active form 
the  categorial consciousness  of Kantianism  in  which consciousness 
ofsefamounts to consciousness oflaw  governed objectivity and vice 
versa 

  Selfconsciousness no longer observes an apparently indepencid

dent reality nor takes  up practical attitudes towards  it  This reality 
and its responses toit are transparently distinguished in its own practicid
cal  activity  which is  the  genus  under which its  actions fall 

  All  that seWconsciousness  now  aims  at is  to  display  itself in 
the daylight of actual existence  turning an act merely intended into 
one actually  performed 

ANALYSIS 

HE SPIRITUAL  ANIMAL  KINGDOM  AND  DECEIT  OR 

THE  MATTER  IN  HAND ITSELF 

  Real individuality is  at first definite and simple but with no 
specific content to differentiate its universality It is  the pure thought 
of a  category rather than its  actual  application 

  Such real individuality involves an original given nature with 
definite qualitative limitations which do not however limit the free 
action  of consciousness 

  All  that the  individual does  springs from  this  original given 
nature which  it  would  not  wish  to  transgress  But its  negativity  is 
not a passive being thus and thus and nothing else  but an active imcid
position of its whole character on what lies  arOlmd  it 

  Action involves  a  subjective object or end  opposed  to what 
is  given as  actual  then an instrumental  transition  in which  the end 
achieves the full form of reality and lastly a realized end which exists 
apart from the subject and his ends In such action the end the origicid
nal nature the original situation the means the  transition  and  the 
resultant reality  are all  only  moments  in  a  transparent identity 

QL  Original  nature  whether  considered  as  special  aptitude 
talent or character is thefirstaspectofalLaction This original nature 
is  as  much reflected in  the  external situation which seems  to evoke 
and shape a mans  aims as  in those aims  themselves  It is  moreover 
only  in  action  in given  circumstances  that  consciousness  becomes 
aware of its  aims  its  aims  as  formed  in thought are  merely  movecid
ments towards action and only become fully definite in  action  The 
circumstances which evoke action and the means used in it are likecid
wise  parts of action  and the individuals inner nature is  also  a  sort 
of means to it  None of the features  distinguishable in action is  really 
independent all count as moments in a single conscious performance 

  The universal  character of a  mans active  nature can  howcid

ever  be  distinguished  from  a  single  specific  performance  and  can 
be compared in  respect of such  characters  as  inventiveness  persist
ence range  etc 

 

  A  mans actions  cannot be judged as  good or  bad  except 
in  a  wqolly  external  comparative  manner  Whatever  a  man  does 
corresponds to his active nature and is  to that extent neither good nor 
bad and neither to  be  admired nor lamented 

  The productofa mans action makes explicit what lay in the 
mans nature and makes this explicit for  the universal consciousness 
In  this  product circumstances aims  means  procedures are  aU  discid
solved  and have  become  part of an  actuality foreign  to  the  agent 
and open to all individuals But it represents what is  transitory rather 
than what is  permanent  in  the  individual concerned  in  it 

V  THE  CERTAINTY  AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON     

  Consciousness  in  such  work  experiences  the  gulf  between 
doing and being Being precedes doing as  the original nature behind 
action  and  being succeeds  doing  as  the  work  which  results  from 
action  It is  in its  work that consciousness  achieves full  reality  and 
gets  rid  of its  emptiness 

  The elements  involved  in  workoriginal  nature  aim  percid
formance  and  resultwill however  at  times  fall  apart  thus  concid
tradicting their essential unity The aim may not express the original 
nature nor issue in an appropriate performance nor yield the desired 
result 

  This element of contingent failure in work is itself contingent 
The  different aspects  of action hang together in  their  Notion  even 
if they  at times fall  apart in reality 

  When a  work  vanishes  its  contingent success  or failure  also 

vanishes What persists in selfconsciousness is  the attempted performcid
ance in which doing and being intention and execution are united 
It is irrelevant that reality sometimes fails  to fulfil a  works intention 
When  a  work  is  conceived  as  indifferent  to  contingent  failure  it 
becomes a  task  as  such or  matter in  hand  itself 

  The matter in hand is  the unit the thing of practical life 
It combines aim with execution circumstances and means with result 
In it selfconsciousness  becomes  real  in a  single  prformance 

  The  matter  in  hand  unites  subjective  individuality  with 
objectivity and puts  selfconsciousness  before  itself in  the  role  of a 
substance The matter in hand has end means procedure and result 
as  its  dependent modes  or  moments  it is  the  genus  which  they  all 
specify But it remains abstratively universal rather than truly a sub
ject since  it  dos not generate such dependent moments 

 

  Honesty of consciousness demands that the  matter in hand 

should expres  the agents best  endevours no matter what the circid
cumstances  or  outcome  may  be  Whatever  happens  he  will  have 
coped  well with  the  matter in hand 

  If the agent has not realized his  aim he has  at least tried  to 
realie it  nd in  so  doing has  dealt  effectively  with  the  matter in 
hang  He has dealt with it evefl  ifothers bring his  work  to  nought 
or ifhe can in fact do nothing about things  He has dealt with it even 
if he has  merely  approved  of something  or  taken  an  interest in  it 
  These emphases  on  the  hopest  coping  with  the  matter  in 
hand shift  their ground  from  case  to  case  Sometimes  a  mere  aim 
suffices  sometimes an act which  fails  of effect  All  attempt  to  turn 
an ineffective or bad  performance into  one  that is  successful 

  The  honest agent is  not  as  honest  as  he  seems  Being  concid

cerned only with his own performance or with some matter in hand or 
with some reality he is not really in earnest about achieving something 

ANALYSIS 

  The  honest  performer  necessarily  moves  towards  being  a 
deceiver  For what others see  him doing never fully  embodies what 
he means to do and so admits of differing interpretations from which 
he  may derive advantage 

  A  man appears in his  actions  to  be  disinterestedly  realizing 
some  matter in hand  but may disappoint others  by showing  that 
he only cares for  this task if done by himself and not by them  Such 
disappointment however shows  their own concern  to  be with  their 
own performance and not with the matter in hand And if they magcid
nanimously leave each  man  to  do his  own  tasks  they still  interfere 
with these through comments and criticisms  They care not for  the 
matter in  hand  but for  their  own  pronouncements  upon  it  And 
those who say  that they care nothing for what others do or say concid
tradict this by submitting their work to  the daylight of publicity 

 B  A  task  in  hand  is  essentially  such  that  all  feel  themselves 
entitled to share in it and to  make it their own whether directly or 
indirectly  Its being a matter in  hand  does  not mean  that it is  not 
interesting to individuals  it is  disinterestedly pursued only  because 
it is  interesting to everyone The matter in hand  therefore becomes 
the category or categorical  imperative  the sort of being  demanded 
by selfconsciousness  Hegel  here  shows  how  the  practical  egoism 
in  which a  man  undertakes  something  to  give  himself something  to 
do necessarily expands into universal  moral egoism where  the  task 
is  set by Everyman for  Everyman 

REASON  AS  LAWGIVER 

 I   Selfconsciousness has now ceased  to be  the  consciousness of 
a  particular individual and  has  become a  consciousness  shared  by 
all individuals and conceived by all as  thus shared Being thus catecid
gorial itis at once the form and the matter of selfconsciusness 

  SeWconsciousness now identifies itselfwith the absolute matcid

ter  in  hand  the  task  which  is  of selfconsciousnesss  essence  and 
which it neither can nor will question This task is theabsol ute ethical 
taskor substance and its consciousness theethical consciousness  But 
it differentiates itself into a  number of distinct tasks or prescriptions 

  Nojustification can be given or sought for these absolute ethicid

cal  imperatives  the pure deliverances of selfconsciousness 

  The imperatives inq uestion are immediately given as the delicid

verances of sound reason  and such soundness  must he immediately 
and  unquestioningly accepted 

  But  just  as  the  immediate  deliverances  of  sensecertaity 
become articulate in  perception so the  deliverances  of moral  sense 
become articulate in various wellknown  precepts 

  Everyone ought to speak the truth This rule has to be quali 

V  THE CERTAINTY AND  TRUTH  OF  REASON     

fiedin many ways eg ifhe believes or knows it to be true An imperacid
tive so  qualified  loses  all  definite  force 

  Love thy neighbour as  thyself  This rule says if it says anycid

thing that we should try to do what is for the good of others a Notion 
a t once  involved  in immense obscurity 

  It becomes clear that the  most we  can demand of an ethical 
precept is  not that it should have definite content but that it should 
be  free  from  internal contradiction 

  All  that the ethical consciousness  can  therefore  prescribe  as 

our task  itself  is  that we  should  do whatever we  usually  do 

  All that it can warn us  against is selfcontradiction in ethical 

use and wont  It therefore becomes only the critic of existing or procid
posed  ethical  laws 

REASON  AS  TESTING  LAWS 

  Selfconsciousness now applies to  ethical precepts  the sort of 
criticism which we  as  phenomenologists  applied  to  them  But  these 
precepts are  no longer  taken to  be the authoritative deliverances  of 
selfconsciousness and they are only criticied in regard to selfconcid
sistency 

  Such criticism is however nugatorysinceany and every COllcid
tent can be made formally selfconsistent eg  neither the institution 
nor  the  noninstitution  of  private  property  need  he  formally  incid
consistentAnd bothinvolve conflicts when we  descend  to  the  level 
ohpecific fulings eg  that each should recdve as much as he needs 
 I  Private  property and communism  are  alike  free  from  concid
tradiction if treated as  simple abstractions  in  the cqncrete both incid
volve infinite contradictions  It is  ridiculous  to  think  that  the  mere 
absence of contradiction so useless in theory could provide guidance 
in  practice 

  Precepts  and  criticisms  of  precepts  are  alike  vanishing 
moments in the ethical consciousness whose substantial content they 
never succeed  in  providing 

  These  moments  enter  into llr  consciousness  of the  ethical 

task  and are aspects of the honest endeavour to gain  clarity and incid
sight  into what we  should dQ 

  But there is  in fact  no  validity in  the  definite  laws  they  precid

scribe nor in  their arbitrary criticisms of the same 

  Tbe spiritual essence or substance of a livingcommunity gives 
alltlle validity that can be given to such onesided precepts and criti 
cisms 

  Ethical law is implicit in communal living It is not grounded 
on arbitrary individual decrees which can simply be disregarded  It 
is  what all men in the community accept as  their standard and  that 

 

ANALYSIS 

without question  and  what  they  do  not  in  any  way see  as  foreign 
or alien 

  True ethicallaw is the unwritten inerrant unalterable divine 
law  spoken of in the  Antigone  It is  not anything  that  an  individual 
can  hope either to  criticize or to justify  and  certainly  not in  terms 
of mere selfconsistency 

VI  SPIRIT 

  Reason becomes Spirit when it achieves the full consciousness 
of itself as being all reality In the previous stage of Observing Reason 
it merely found itselfin an existent object  From this it rose  to a stage 
in  which  it  no  longer passively  perceived  itself  in  an  object  but 
imposed itself more actively on the world a stage as  onesided as  the 
previous one  Finally  it rose  to  an as  yet  abstract identification  of 
itself with  reality  in  the  vocational  dedication  of itself to  the  task 
itself or in the arbitrary institution of moral canons  or in  the  percid
sonal  pronouncement upon such canons 

  The essence of Spirit has already been recognized as  the ethicid
cal substance  the customs  and laws of a  society  Spitithowever is 
the ethical actuality which when it confronts itself in objective social 
form  has  lost all sense  of strangeness  in  what it has  before  it  The 
ethical substance ef custom and law is  the foundation  and source of 
everyones action and the aim towards which it tends it is  the  COmcid
mon work which mens cooperative efforts seek to bring about The 
ethical substance is as it were the infiniteselfdispensing benevolence 
on which every individual draws  Ids of the essence of this substance 
to come to life in distinct individuals and to act through and in them 
  Spirit is  the absolutely real  being of which all previous forms 
ofconsciousness have represented falsely isolated abstractions which 
the  dialectical  development has shown them to  be  In  the  previous 
stages of observational and active Reason Spirit has rather had Reason 
than been Reason it has imposed itself as  a  category on material not 
intrinsically categorized When Spirit sees itself and its world as being 
Reason it becomes  ethical substance actualized 

  Spirit in its immediacy is theethicallifeofa people ofindivicid
duality at one with a  social  world  But it must  advance  to  the  full 
consciousness of what it immediately is  through many complex stages 
stages  realized  in  a  total  social world and  not  merely  in  a  separate 
individual consciousness 

  The living ethical world is  Spirit in  its  truth  its  abstract 
seWknowledge  being  the  formal  generality  of law  But  it  dirempts 
itselfon the one hand into the hard reality of a world of culture and 

VI  SPIRIT  

  
on the other hand into the inner reali ty of a world of fai th and insgh t 
The  conflict  between  these  two  modes  of experience  is  resolved  in 
Spiritsureofitself  ie  in  morality  Out  of all  these  attitudes  the 
actual selfconsciousness of absolute Spirit will  make its  appearance 

THE  TRUE  SPIRIT  THE  ETHICAL  ORDER 

  Spirit  is  a  consciousness  which  intrinsically  separates  its 
moments whether in its substance or in its consciousness  In its  con 
sciousness  the individual  moral act and  the accomplished  work  are 
separated  from  the  general  moral  substance  or  essence  the  term 
which serves as middle term between them is the individual conscious 
agent 

  The ethical substance  ie  the  system  of laws  and  customs 
itself reflects  the distinction between the  individual action or agent 
on the one hand and  the  moral substance or essence  on  the other 
It splits  up into  a  human and a  divine  law  The individual harried 
by these contradictory laws both knows and does not know the wrongcid
ness  of his  acts  and is  tragically destroyed in the conflict  Through 
such  tragic  instances  individuals  learn  to  advance  beyond  blind 
obedience to law and custom They achieve the ability to  make can  
scientious decisions  to  obey or disobey 

TBE  ETHICAL  WORLD 

  Spirit  is  essentially  sefdiremptive  But just as  bare  being 
dirempts itselfinto the Thing with its  many properties so the ethical 
life dirempts itselfinto a web of ethical relations And just as the many 
properties  of  the  Thing  concentrate  themselves  into  the  contrast 
between individuality and universality so too do ethical laws resolve 
themselves  into individual and  universal laws 

  The  ethical  substanceas  individual  reality  is  the  com 
monalty which realizes itsefin a  plurality of existent consciousnesses 
in an of which it is consciously reflected but which also underlies them 
as  substance  and  contains  them  in  itself  As  actual  substance  it  is 
a  people as  actual consciousness  the  citizens  of that people  Such a 
people is  not anything unreal  it exists  and  prevails 

  This Spirit can be called the human law since itisa completely 
selfconscious actuality I tis presnt as  the known law and as the pre 
vailing custom  I t shows itself in  the  assurance  of individuals  genercid
any and of the government in particular It has a daylightswaYl and 
lets  individuals go freely  about their  business 

  The ethical substance reveals itsefl however in another law 
the  Divine  Law which springs  from  the  immediatel  simple essence 
of the  ethical  and  is  opposed  to  the  fully  conscious  dimension  of 
action  and extends  down  to  the  inner essence  of individuals 

 

ANALYSIS 

  The Divine Law has its own selfconsciousness the immediate 
consciousness  of selfinother  in  a  natural  ethical  community  the 
Family  The  Family  is  that elementary  unconscious  ethical  being 
which  is  opposed  to  and  yet  is  also  presupposed  by  the  conscious 
ethical  being of the  people and  their devotion  to  common ends 

  In the Family natural relations carry universal ethical meancid

ings The individual in the Family is  primarily related to  the Family 
as  a  whole  and  not  by  ties  of love  and sentiment  to  its  particular 
members The Family further is not concerned to promote the wellcid
being of its  individual  members  nor to  offer  them  protection  It is 
concerned with individuality raised out of the  unrest and change of 
life  into  the  universality of death  ie  the  Family exists  to  promote 
the cult of the  dead 

  The individuality by dying achieves  peace  and  universality 

through a merely natural process As regards its timing it is only accicid
dentally connected with the services he performs  to  the community 
even though dying is in a sense the supreme service to the community 
that a  man can perform  in furnishing  the  Family with its  ancestral 
pantheon its  household  Lares  In order  however  that  the  indivicid
duals taking up into universality may be effective it must be helped 
out by a  conscious act on  the  part of the Family members  This act 
may indifferently be regarded as the saving of the deceased individual 
from destruction or as the conscious effecting of that destruction so 
that the individual becomes a thingof the past a  universal meaning 
The FamUy resists the corruption of worms and of chemical agencies 
by substituting their own conscious  work in its  place  byconsigning 
the dead indiviqualsolemnly to  the imperishable elementary indivicid
dual the earth It thereby also makes the dead person an imperishable 
presiding part of the  Family 

  All living relations to  the individual Family members while 
yetin the realm of actuality  are mattersofthe human law The Divine 
Law only concerns  individuals  no  longer  actual  who  have  become 
universal meanings still efficacious in a  peoples and a  Familys life 
  Therearein bothJaws differences and gradations In discusscid

ing these  we  shall see  them in active operation  enjoying  their  own 
selfconsciousness  and  also  interacting with one another 

  The human law has its Iivingseat in the government in which 
it alto assumes individual form  The government is  the actual Spirit 
which reflects on itself  and is the self of the whole ethical substance 
It may accord a limited independence to  the families  under its sway 
but is always ready to subordinate them to  the whole It may likewise 
accord  a  limited  independence  to  individuals  promoting  their own 
gain and enjoyment  but it has  to  prevent such  individua  interests 
from becoming overriding From time to  time it must foster  wars  to 

 

prevent individual life from becoming a  mere  case of natural being 
and ceasing to serve  the freedom and power of the social whole  The 
daylight  human  law  however  always  bases  its  authority  on  the 
deeper authority of the subterranean  Divine Law 

  The Divine Law governs three different familyrelationships 
that of husband to wife of parents to children and of siblings  to one 
another  The  husbandwife relation  is  a  case  of  immediate  selfcid
recognition in another consciousness which has also a  mainly natural 
character  its  reality lies  outside  of itself  in  the  children  in  which 
it  passes  away 

  A relationship unmixed with transience or inequality of status 
is  that of brother and sister  In  them  identity of blood  has  come  to 
tranquillity and equilibrium As  sister  a  woman has  the  highest  incid
timations of ethical essence not yet brought out into actuality or full 
consciousness she  manifests  internal feeling and  the divinity  that is 
raised above the actual As daughter a woman must see her parents 
pass away with resigned tendernessas mother and wife there is some 
thing natural and replaceable about her  and  her  unequal  relation 
to  her  husband  in  which  she  has  duties  where  he  mainly  has 
pleasuresmeans thatshe cannot fully be aware of herself in another 
In brother and sister there are none of the inequalities due  to  desire 
nor any possibility of replacement the loss of a brother is irreparable 
to  a sister  and her duty  to  him is  the  highest 

  The brother represents the familyspirit at its most individlal 
and  therefore  turned  outwards  towards  a  wider  universality  The 
brother leaves  the immediate  elemental negative ethical life  of the 
Family  to achieve a  selfconscious  actual  ethical life 

  The brother passes from  the suzerainty of the divine  to  that 
of the human law thesisterorwife remains the guardian of the Divine 
Law  They  have  each  a  different  natural vocationa sequel of the 
vocation considered above  in  the  task itselC a  vocation which  has 
its  outer expression in  the distinction of sex 

  The  humaQ  and  ethical  orders  require  one  allother  The 
human law has its roots in the divine order whereas the Divine Law 
is  only actual in  the daylight realm of existence  and activity 

  The ethical system in its two branches fulfils all  the imperfect 
categories  that haye led up to it  It is  rational in that it unites selfcid
consciousness and objectivity It observes itself in the customs which 
surround it It has pleasure in the family life and necessity in the wider 
social order  It has  the  law of the  heart at its  root which is  also  the 
law of all hearts It exhibits virtue and the devotion to the task itself 
I t provides  the  criterion  by which all  detailed  projects and acts are 
tested 

   The ethical whole is  a  tranquil equilibrium of parts in which 

ANALYSIS 

 
each finds its satisfaction in this  equilibrium with  the whole  Justice 
is  the agency which restores this equilibrium whenever it is  disturbed 
by  individuals  or  classes  The  communal  spirit  avenges  itself  on 
wrongs  done  to  its  members  wrongs  which  have  the  mechanical 
character of the  merely  natural  by  equally  natural  expedients  of 
revenge 

  Universal selfconscious Spirit is  chiefly manifest in the man 
unconscious individualized Spirit in the woman both serve as  middle 
terms in what amounts to  the same syllogism uniting the divine with 
the human law 

ETHICAL  ACTION 

  In the opposition of the two laws we have not yet considered 
the  role  of the  individual  and  his  deed  It is  the  individuals  deed 
which  brings  the  two  laws  into  conflict  A  dreadful  fate  Schicksal 
here enters the scene and makes action come out on one side or the 
other 

  The individuals selfalignment with one law does  not howcid

ever involve internal debate and arbitrary choice  only immediate 
unhesitantdutifulself  commitroent There is no quarrel of duty with 
passion much lesany ridiculous seeming conflict of duty with duty 
I t is ones sex Hegel suggests which decides which law one wiHobey 
  In  self  consciousness  the  two  laws  are  explicit  not  merely 
implicit as in ordinary ethical life The individuals character commits 
him to one law The other seems to him only an unrigh teous actuality 
or a  case of human obstinacy or perversity 

  The ethical consciousness cannot like  the consciousness that 
preceded  it  draw any distinction  between  an objective  order  and 
its  own subjective order  it cannot doubt  that  the  law  it obeys  has 
absolute authority  Nor is  there  any  taint ofindividuality  left  over 
that can  deflect  it from  the  path  of duty  It cannot  conceive  that 
its  duty  could  be other than what it knows  it to  be 

  None the less  the ethical consciousness cannot divest itself of 
allegiance to both laws  and so  cannot escape guilt when it opts for 
the one as opposed to the other Only an inert unconscious stone can 
avoid incurring guilt The guilt is however not indvidual but coHee  
tive  It is  the guilt of a  whoJe  class  or sex 

  The law violated by an individuals act necessarily demands 
vindication even  though its  voice  was  not at the time  heard by  the 
violator  Action brings the unconscious into the daylight  and forces 
consciousness  to  bow  to  its  offended  majesty 

  The ethical consciousness is mos t truly guil ty when it wi ttingly 
rejects the behests of one law and holds them to be violent and wrong 

 
Its action denies  the demand for  real fulfilment  which is  part of the 
law  and so  involves  real  guilt 

 I  The individual cannot survive  the  tragic  conflict  in  him  of 
the  two laws  neither of which he can repudiate  He cannot merely 
have a sentiment Gesinnung for the one His whole being is consumed 
in  pathos  which is  part of his  character as  an ethical being 

  In the fateful conflict of two laws in different individuals both 
individuals undergo destruction Each is  guilty in the face of the law 
he  has  violated  It is  in  the  equal  subordination  of both sides  that 
absolute right is  first  carried out 

  A young man leaves the unconscious natural medium of ethicid

calHfe to become ruler of the community and administer the human 
law  But  the  natural  character of his  origins  may  show  itself in  a 
duplicity of existence  eg  Eteocles  and  Polynices  The community 
is bound to honour the one who actually possesses  power and to dis 
honour the mere claimant to state power who takes up arms against 
the community This dishonour involves deprivation of burial rights 
  The familyspirit  backed  by  the  Divine  Law  and with  its 
roots in the underworld waters of forgetfulness  isaffronted  by these 
hUDan arrangements The dead mn fincis  instruments of vengeance 
by which the representatiyes of the hurqan law  are in their turn decid
stroyed 

  The battle oflaws with its inherent paths  is  carried on  by 
hmnan agents which  gives  it an  air of contingency  The  atomistic 
family  has  to  be liquidated in the continuity of communal  life  but 
the latter continues to have its roots in  the former  Womankind that 
eternal source of irony reduces to ridicule the grave deliberations of 
the state elders and asserts the daims of youth The communal spirit 
then takes its revenge on feminine  anarchy by impressing youth into 
war  In war the ethical substance  asserts  its  negtttivity  its  freedom 
from all existent arrangements But since victory depends on fortune 
and strength  this  sort  of ethical  community  breaks  down  and  is 
superseded by a soulless universal ethical community based on limitcid
less  individualism 

  Thedestruction of the ethical world of custom lies  in its mere 
naturalness its immediacy  This immediacy breaks down because  it 
tries  to  combine  the  unconscious  peace of nature with  the  selfconcid
scious unresting peace of Spirit An ethical system of this natural sort 
is inevitably restricted and gets superseded by another similar system 
Spiritual communal life  necessarily  detaches  itself from such  tribalcid
ism  and erects  itself into  a  formally  universal  open  society  term 
not used by Hegel  dispersed among a vast horde of separate indivicid
duals 

 

ANALYSIS 

LEGAL  STATUS 

  The universality into which the ethical substance has now de 

veloped  is  the soulless  commonalty which  has  ceased  to  be  the  selfcid
conscious substance of its members These latter alone in their atomcid
istic multiplicity are real and substantial All are equal and all count 
as persons The abstract individuality of the dead person in the  tribal 
state has become the abstract of selfconsciousness the spirit of the 
new  community 

  Individual personality is  now  the  acknowledged  substantial 
principle But it is an abstract principle instantiated in disjoined selves 
which lack a common substance Use of concept of Sprodigkeit  brittlecid
ness  diremptiveness  non  cohesion 

  The world  of abstract atomic  persons  carries  out in  reality 

what in Stoicism isa mere abstraction The abstract right of the indivicid
dual person depends merely on his being a person not on any superior 
inner richness or power 

  The world ofrightendowed persons develops dialecticaly as 
does Stoicism Since it gives  no content to  personality and personal 
rightithas to relate itto senseJess  external  things  Persons  become 
propertyowners and sotrivialandcontemptible and their rights are 
all  rights  to  property  Stress  on  property in Roman law 

 I  Since empty individuality is the guiding principle of therigh tcid
state itnaturally incarnatesitselfin an arbitratilyselected individual 
anemperoror living god whose universal ownership can only express 
itself in monstrous excess 

  Sinee legal  personality is  devoid of content  the abstract incid

dividuality that incarnates its  principle is  such  as  to  destroy  it and 
also  itself 

  In legal personality the person is meant to be absolutely essencid

tial but its  abstraction  makes it completely  unessential  the prey of 
unlimited  caprice  The  absolute  unessentiality  of  the  individual 
becomes  the  heart  of a  new  phase  of experience  that  f the  selfcid
estranged  person  in  a  world of culture 

SELFALIENATED SPIRIT  CULTURE 

  Theethical substance has  in  the state of mere  right  put its 
ethical being outside of itself  As  an abstract individual  it confronts 
the world ordered by law and custom as something alien from which 
it feels estranged The world is  its own world but not seen as its own 
world and accordingly becomes objectively different  Ruined is  the 
atomistic assertion  of personal  rights  it acquiesces  in  a  social  order 
which seems  deeply foreign 

  The ethical substance then opposes  to  the real  ethical order 

VI  SPIRIT  

 
which seems deeply alien a  pure essential order representative of its 
inward thoughts and ideals The real order is  thisworld  and strange 
the essential  order is  an otherworld  in which it would feel  at home 
  The ethical Spirit thereby comes  to  inhabit  two  worlds  an 
actual world ofculture and civilization and an unreal world posited 
by faith and more truly in harmony with itself  But just as  the divine 
and  human  laws  vanish  in  the  atomistic  legal  person  so  do  both 
worlds vanish in  the pure insight of the  Enlightenment with its  un  
knowable god at one pole and its pure utility at the other This pure 
insight refines  itself into  the  nullity  of revolutionary freedom  from 
which it must return to repossess itself of its  alienated content in  the 
new  phase of morality 

THE  WORLD  OF  SELFALIENATED  SPIRIT 

  Spirit  now  lives  in  two  worlds  one  of selfalienation  and 
the other offaith where however in fleeingfrom  the former world 
it is involved in another form  of the same selfalienation  The prin  
ciple of the former world not being a ware of its Notion has the false 
limitation of being opposed  to faith 

TRE  RALM OF  ENLIGHTENMENT 

  The world weare abouttoconsideris one in which conscious  
ness  externalizes  itself  which  accordingly  seeJnsstrange  to  it  and 
which it has  to  master  Only  by  masteringthe world can  tlelfDcon  
sciousness  have  the  universality which is  its  validity  and  its  reality 
This universality involves conformity to general patterns and is  not 
to  be confused  with  the  merely  formal  universality of the  realm  of 
right 

  In the world we are about to  consider  the individual counts 
and is real on account ofhis Bildung his culture He is actual powerful 
only  to  the  extent  that  he  is  cultivated  His  natural  being  and 
endowment in all its forms is  utterly unimportant only as cultivated 
are  they  better or worse 

   The cultured individual exercises his ability and  talents in  a 
cultured world  In making his mark in  the world he in  effect  helps 
to make the woddin which he makes his mark  though he isnotcon 
scious  of doing so 

   In  the world each  man  has  a  place  and an opening for  his 
talents and this  place goes with seemingly fixed judgements of good 
and bad Since he is  part of the world such judgements always stand 
over against other seemingly just as  definite judgemnts

and Earth so the social milieu direm pts itself in to    a spirit of overcid
all uniformity  a spiri t of individ ual diversifica tion and   a spirit 
which embodies both aspects and unites them in its selfconsciousness 
There is nothing here analogous to the element offate which embodies 
the conflicts of family  and state selfconsciousness embodies both 

  The spirit of uniformity  in  a  society  comes  before  the  pure 
and detached consciousness on the one hand and the involved actual 
consciousness on the other as the good element in that society whereas 
the spirit of divergent individualism comes before them as  the had elecid
ment 

  The good  element in  the society  considered  as  a  reality  is 
the state  power  in  which  all  individual  endeavours  are  integrated 
while  the bad element is  represented by the  riches aimed at by  their 
personal  selfaggrandizing efforts  But  the  quest  for  wealth  is  in 
reality as much for the good of the whole as the state power and both 
are  the  same at bottom 

  Selfconsciousness sees its substance content and End in two 
spiritual powers  Its  beinginself is  the state power its  beingforself 
rkhesSelfconsciousnessnecessarily judges thesetwo powers and sees 
the formeras  goodapd the latter as bad  But because both involve 
their opposites  this judgement can always be reversed 

  What things intrinsically are is  what selfconsciousness  finds 
them to  be  and so  the  prima facie judgements of selfconsciousness 
wWnecessarHy be reversed on deeper reflection 

  Thi reversal makes the state power be an oppressive in terfercid

ing  evil  thing  in  which  selfconsciousness  fails  to  recognize  itself 
whereas riches becomes a  good thing to  it which only harms certain 
individuals accidentally 

  This reversed judgement is  however itself reversible  on still 
deeper reflection  State power is  seen as  realizing the nduring good 
of individuals  and  organizing  their  activities  whereas  riches  only 
ministers  to  their  vanishing enjoyments 

  Selfconsciousness  now  judges  its  own  judgements  finding 
goodness  in judgements which  recognize  themselves  in  state  power 
or  riches  badness in judgements which  regard either as  bad 

  If a  man judges state power in a  good manner he  takes  up 
a nobleminded attitude towards it and becomes  intent on political 
and sodal service  If he judges riches  aright  he  is  grateful  towards 
it  and  the  dispensers  of it 

  To judge badly of either of these  powers  is  to  adopt a  basecid
minded attitude ORe which secretly rebels against all rulers and uses 
while it despises  wealth 

  Both these Judgements are immediate and onesided they are 
not brought together in consciousness as they are for  us  philosophers 

VI  SPIRIT  

 
But  this  immediacy  generates  a  demand  for  a  reasoned  syllogistic 
demonstration  by way of a  middle term which will  suffice  to  bring 
them  together 

  The nobleminded consciousness positively disposed towards 
state power and negatively  to  its  own selfish  purposes  achieves  the 
heroism of service 

  The heroism of service endows consciousness with selfrespect 
and exacts respect from others But it also is  the real  ultimate source 
of state  power 

  At first selfconsciousness only gives the state power an impercid

sonal  legislative  status  not  an  individual  one  The  haughty  vassal 
retains  his  individuality  and  offers  advice  counsel  to  the  state 
powers 

  The relation of the haughty vassal to the state power is  ostencid

siblynoble and loyal even  unto  death  but is  none  the less  always 
ready secretly  to  conspire against the state for  personal ends 

  A true selfsurrender to the state power gives the latter its own 

individual will  makes  it a  monarch 

  In  all  cases  of  selfalienation  language  plays  an  operative 
role  Through language  the individual makes  himself universal  and 
impersonal  and transcends  his  immediate  changing  self  Of  the 
divine  universality of language in sensecertainty 

  Spiritisessentiallysuch as to be one in and throughseparatcd 
sides each of which treats the other as an object excluded from itself 
As such it will itself express itself as an existent object ie a monarch 
distinct from its  many sides 

  The universal best is a poor expression of the profound unity 
underlying the various sides in asocicty An individual monarchical 
will is  a  better  truer expression 

 I  I  The nobleminded consciousness now develops a  language of 
flattery  to  reconcile  itself with  the  supreme  monarchical  will  The 
monarch  becomes  unlimited  and  absolute  and  is  spoken  of by  his 
proper name  The monarch identifies  himself with  the  state  power 
Letat  cest  moi 

  Theilattery of the subjects really creates the monarchical selfcid

consciousness  But th nobility in  practising flattery retains its  inner 
conscious independence and turns the monarch into a mere dispenser 
of wealth 

 I   The  nobleminded  consciousness  through  its  unscrupulous 

use  of flattery  becomes indistinguishable  from  the  base  consciouscid
ness

of wealth for  which he  becomes  boundlessly grateful

tion ofa definite individual It is a form of intrinsic being Ansichsein 
in  which  beingforself is  negated 

 I   In the  pursuit of wealth  the  nobleminded individual  comes 

under the sway of an alien  power 

  In the pursuit of wealth an individuals  personaJity  becomes 
enslaved  to  the chance  personality  of another  What  he  personally 
is becomes utterly impersonal a  commodity like others to be bought 
and sold Feeling tha t every thing essen tial is reduced to un essen tiali ty  
the  individual  becomes  profoundly  rebellious 

  The self seeing itseJfthus superseded and rejected supersedes 
this supersession and  rejects  this rejection  It is  consciously for  itself 
in and  through  them 

 I g  In its inner independence the self rises  above  the  distinction 
of the noble and baseminded both become a single attitude Wealth 
in being universally dispensed gives selfconscious independence and 
freedom  of choice  to  all  but these  are  exercised  at the  expense  of 
others  An  arrogance  of wealth  arises  which  generates  unbounded 
resentment 

  Selfconsciousness uses a language of nobleflattery in dealing 
with state power it employs a language of ignoble flattery in dealing 
with wealth But the language which  truly expresses its  Zerrissenheit 
its  torn  state  is  one  whijh  makes  diremption  its  essence  which  in 
all  its  judgements  unites  terms  in  an  utterly  irreevantexternal 
fashion  Its only reason for dealing with  things  together is  that they 
ha ve  nothing to  do with each other 

 I  The absolute universal inversion ofreaHty and thought their 
mutual  estrangement  is  thefinaJ  product  of culture  Everything 
becomes  void  of substance  and  confounded  with  its  opposite  All 
values  become  transvalued  Spirit in  this  phase  of culture speaks  a 
language  of  utter  disintegration  which takes  the  novel  form  of 
wit 

  Wit runs  the  whole  gamut of the  serious  and  the  silly  the 
trivial and the profound  the lofty and  the  infamous  with complete 
lack of taste and shame  see  Diderots  Nephew  qf Rameau 

  Plain sense and sound morality can teach  this  disintegrated 
brilliance nothing that it does  not  know  It can  merely  utter some 
of the syllables the latter weaves into its piebald discourse In concedcid
ing that the bad and good are mixed in life it merely substitutes dull 
platitude for  witty brilliance 

  The disintegrated consciousness can be noble and edifying but 

this is  for it only one note among others  To ask it to  forsake  its  discid
integration is  merely  from  its  own  point of view  to  preach  a  new 
eccentricity  that of Diogenes in his  tub 

 The disintegrated  consciousness  is  however  on  the  way  to 

VI  S PI Rl T   

transcending its disintegration It sees the vanity of treating all things 
as  vain  and so  becomes serious 

  Wit really emancipates the disintegrated consciousness from 
finite  material aims and gives  it true spiritual freedom  In knowing 
itselfas disintegrated it also rises above this and achieves a truly posicid
tive  selfconsciousness 

FAITH  AND  PURE  INSIGHT 

  Beyond the alienated world of culture seems  to stand the uncid
real world of pure insight or  thought  Consciousness  does  not  howcid
ever recognize that it is  its own thought that occupies  the  transcencid
dental medium but rather fills it with  Vorstellungen  picturethoughts 
The world beyond is  a  religious pictureworld unreal but conceived 
as  real 

  Religious faith  with its simple affirmation of a  real  beyond 
is  distinct  from  the  religious  phases  considered  before  ie  the 
anguished squirmings of the Unhappy Consciousness  or the familycid
centred cult of the dead 

  Since consciousness in religious belief flees  the world it concid

tinues to carry something which represents the worldly consciousness 
in itself  This accompanying voice is  that of the never resting critical 
negativity which has emerged out of the realm of culture and which 
destroys all positivity and all  objectivity This  negative consciousness 
is  without definite content of its  own  but it fastens  itself on the piccid
torial content of religious  belief and devours  the latter 

  Both faith and pure insight representconsclollsnessreturning 
to itself from the dispersed world of culture Each presents three sides 
for examination  a  what it is  in and for  itself  b  how it standsto 
reality  c  how it stands to its sister  mode of transcendence 

I  For faith its absolute object is a  pictorial reflection of the real 

world with  the  historical  character of that real world 

  In its relation to the real world  the object of faith articulates 
itself into  the  Absolute  Father  the  selfoffering  Son  and  the  Holy 
Spirit in which it returns  to  its  original simplicity 

  Since the Son and Holy Spiritbring the transcendent religious 

object into  relation  with  reality  they  also  bring  the  believing selfcid
consciousness  into relation with  the  transcendent 

  The spirit of religious faith  lives  in the world of culture  but 
tdes to  rise  above  its  vanity  to  the  transcendent religious  object  It 
practises acts of devotion which  bring it no nearerto its goal  which 
it locates  in a  remote region  of time and space 

  For pure insight  the  Notion or concept alone  has  reality 
  It seeks  to overthrow every  type of independence other than 

that of sef  consciousness 

ANALYSIS 

  In its  first appearance the Notion of pure insight is  not fully 
realized  It refers everything  to  the future  in  the form  of an aim  to 
be realized All is  to be given a rational reduction which will be valid 
for everyone Differences between individuals do not count they are 
differences of degree  not of kind  Pure insight is  something that all 
can exercise and  possess 

ENLIGHTENMENT 

  Pure insight is  essentially opposed to religious  faith  It is 
also opposed to the real world and Jghts against its impure intentions 
and  perverted insights 

THE  STRUOGLE  OF  ENLIGHTENMENT  WITH  SUPERSTITION 
  Enlightenment  unites  all  the  destructive  negative  poses  of 
consciousness in one I t is  the same as religious fai th but seems utterly 
opposed to it since it denies all the pictorial content of religious faith 
What content it has it borrows from religious faith  and causes it all 
to  disappear 

  To enlightenment religious faith  is  in  the  main  mass  of the 
people unconscious error and superstition But it also a ttribu tes a self 
consciousness  to  this  error  in  the  person  of deceiving  priests  and 
despots 

  Enlightenment appeals to theinsight latent in all to free themcid

selves from  the impostures of religion 

  Enlightenment is essentially ambivalent in its relation to  the 
naive  consciousnesswhich itsees  as  a  ready  prey  to imposture  yet 
capable of achieving insight 

  Enlightenment thinks that it will win its way to mens minds 
without a  painful struggle and  by a  simple infection  One fine  day 
the false idols of religion will simply lie Hat on the floor before it  The 
Nephew  of Rameau 

  But  it also  engages  in  various  noisy  combats  with  religious 

superstition 

  Pure insight gives a  false  reality to  the superstition  that concid

fronts  it  and pretends that itis something that it has  to defeat 

  The other  of pure insight can only  be pure insight  it can 
only condemn what it is  since  beyond itself nothing is  admitted  to 
have substance But it maintains itselfby confusedly finding an other 
in  the objects  of religion  another form  of itself for  us  but not for 
it  which it condemns as  irrational lies  leading  to  bad purposes 

  The object of religion  is  rightly  declared  by  enlightenment 

to be a product of the religious mans thought but it is  wrongly supcid
posed that this means that this object is  a  mere fabrication  The relicid
gious  mans trust in God is  a  recognition of the identity of God with 

V I  SPI RIT   

his  own  rational being  The worship  of the  religious  community  is 
likewise something in which God comes to be as the spirit of that comcid
munity  and does  not remain  blandly beyond It 

  For the religious consciousness  talk of priestly deception etc 
is  absurd since  its  object  corresponds  to  the  inmost nature  of concid
sciousness The lie lies rather in enligh tenment which makes the object 
of religion  something entirely  different  from  what  it  essentially  is 
There can in fact be no delusion regarding the inmost reality in which 
consciousness  finds  the  direct certainty of itself 

 I  Pure  insight  misin terprets  the  various  aspects  of religious 
belief  ie  its view of the absolute essence  the grounds of this  belief 
and  the  nature of its service  to  this  essence 

  Pure insight wrongly supposes  that religious  belief adores  a 
sensuous object a lump of wood or stone a wafer made of paste etc 
  But religious beliefis not really oriented  towllrds  a  temporal 
sensuous thing  It goes  beyond this  towards  a  thoughtobject which 
alone is  selfexistent 

  Pure insight regards  religion  as  basing  itself on  contingent 

historical matters offact whose evidence is inferior to thatofthe newscid
papers  and which has  passed  through  many  distorting  media  eg 
inadequate translations  The religious consciousness  however  bases 
itself solely on internal grounds of certainty  Only  when  corrupted 
by  enlightenment does  it look for  historical support 

  Religious acts reaUyconsistin cancellingthe individuals parcid
ticularity which makes them appear senseless without definiteobjeccid
tive  to  pure insigh t 

  To pure insight the religious  consciousness  is foolish when it 
seeks  union with its  ideal by foregoing  natural enjoyments etc  For 
pure  insight  the  religious  consciousness  is  likewise  foolish  in  rising 
above isolatedindividualismand renouncing private property To the 
charge offoolishness  it adds  the further charge of moral wrongness 
thereby making finite ends the sole ends of action and being untrue 
even  to  its  own  transcendence of these 

  The Tole of enlightenment is  to  make religious faith aware of 
what it  intrinsically  is  What  however  is  the  positive  truth which 
enlightenment  opposes  to  religious  superstition  It  removes  from 
absolute  being aU  sensuous  properties  and  so  turns  it  into  a  mere 
vacuum  to  which  no predicate can be attributed 

  Over against absolute reality stands the individual whose pricid

mary  awareness  is  sensecertainty  which  has  become  the  absolute 
truth through the destruction of all sensetranscending forms of concid
sciousness Senseexperience is supposed to involve certainty as  to the 
reality of the sensitive person and of other things external to  himself 
all of which  exis t  absolutely 

ANALYSIS 

  Enlightenment can indifferently place featureless intrinsic 
being beyond sensible things or in them  It can further comhine these 
two  ways  of regarding sensible  things  in  which  they  come  to  have 
their whole  being  in  their  usefulness  for  other finite  things  beyond 
themselves  Reason is  the  function  which  prevents immoderate selfcid
assertion and makes everything continue to  be  truly useful  to  everycid
thing else 

 I  The mutual serviceableness of all things is  for  pure insight a 
reflection of their derivation from the absolute essence which is  itself 
the supremely  useful  profitable  thing 

  Faith finds  the  positive  outcome of enlightenment  abomincid
able its  empty absolute  its  goodness  present in everything its  sumcid
mingup of religion  in  utility  It sees  in  enlightenment nothing  but 
selfconfessed  banali ty  

  Faith has a  divine  right  against  enlightenment  by  which  it 
feels itselfutterly wronged The enlightenment too has a divine right 
against faith  based  on the selfconsciousness which it expresses  and 
which  is  such  as  to  absorb its  OPPQsite 

  Enlightenment does not attack faith with principles peculiar 
to  itself but  with  those  that  faith  itselfacknowledges  It  merely 
reminds faith  of certain  sides  of itself which in certain  situations it 
tends  to forget  What it  brings  before faith  is  as  much  an  essential 
part of it as  the aspects  that itopposes 

 

  Jnregarding faith  as  its  sheer  opposite  enlightenment fails 
torecognizeits own self It does not see that the thought it condemns 
in faith  is  its  own  Against faith  insight is  the  power  of the Notion 
relating distinct moments toone another and bringing out their concid
tradiction It has right against faith  because faith contains both concid
tradictory elements in itself 

  If faith  errs  in  making  its  object  something  alien  quite 
beyond  its  own  devotional  activities  insight  reminds it of its  error 
in  stressing  that  its  object  is  its  own  creation  But  insight  errs  in 
making  the  object  of  faith  a  contingent  fiction  I t  also  itself 
believesin an unattainable unsearchable Absolute  and is  therefore 
on a level with faith which combines the cognate with the unsearchcid
able 

  Both faith and insight wrongly isolate  the sensuous from  the 
notional the former in looking at both thisworld  and its otherworld 
in incompatible ways  which it fails  to  combine  the  latter in  seeing 
this world as abandoned by Spirit and playing no part in the essential 
process  of Reason 

  As regards the ground of knowledge faith acknowledges that 
its knowledge of the Absolute involves an element of the contingent 
but  forgets  this  in  its  facetoface confrontation  with  the  absolute 

V I  S P I R IT   B 

essence  Enlightenment  however  remembers  only  the  former  and 
forget the latter 

  Enlightenment  regards  the  sacrifice  of  property  and  en 
joyment by faith  as  wrong and inexpedient  Faith  however  recog 
nizes  the  merely symbolic character of such sacrifices 

  Enligh ten men t sees it as absurd to sacrifice a  particular concid

crete source of pleasure  eg  by fasting  if ones  aim  is  to  be  rid  of 
sensual  desire  altogether 

 I  But  enlightenment  is  here  wrongly  abstract  in  seeing  the 

essential element in mere intention or thought and not in  the carrycid
ingout of the latter in  the  instinctive realm 

  Enlightenment has irresistible power over faith since it brings 
into  play  moments  present  in  faith  itself  It seems  to  destroy  the 
beautiful unity of trust and immediate certainty to sully spirituality 
with  sensuousness  to  disturb  calm  certainty  with the  idle  play  of 
understanding  and  selfwill  But  in  reality  enlightenment  enables 
faith  to  overcome  its  splitmindedness  its  dreaming  life  among 
notionless  thoughts on the one hand and its  waking life  among the 
realities  of sense  on the other 

  The effect ofcnlightenment is  to empty faith of its imagina a 
tivecontent and to turn itinto a pure yearning for an empty beyond 
Its object is the same as the empty Absolute of enlightenment except 
that  it  is  not  satisfied  with  this  object  whereas  enlightenment  is 
satisfied But enlightenments satisfactiqn is even as such merely parcid
tial  as  is  shown in  its further  turning towards  thisworld  utility 

TUE  TRUTH  OF  ENLIGHTENMENT 

  Pure insight in its ultimate development frames  an object  to 
fit  itself  pure  thought in the form  of a  Thing an Absolute  without 
determinations in which all distinctions are without a difference This 
empty Absolute  is  the same  as  the  object  to  which  faith  sank  back 
when  disillusioned  of  sensecontent  by  enlightenment  The  selfcid
alienated N odon does not however see the iden tity of these two Absocid
lutes  with each  other  and  with  the  selfconsciousness  which  draws 
these  distinctions 

  The fightwith faith reproduces itself within enlightenment 
in the form ofa dual Absolute on the one hand the pure predicateless 
supreme being or first  cause  and  on  the  other hand  an Absolute 
which  especially  involves  the  negation of all  sensuous  quality  and 
so  becomes  invisible  intangible  etc  underlying  matter  Both  are 
essentially  the same concept  different  only  in  their  startingpoint 
What the one regards as  horror  and  the other despises  as  folly  are 
altogether the same Thought is being the copula is here a separation 
as  well  as  a connection so  that thought becomes  opposed  to  its  own 

 
shadow  matter  But  matter as  purely  negative  is  indistinguishable 
from thought The Cartesian Cogito ergo sum establishes the overriding 
identity which enligh tenment fails  to  perceive 

ANALYSIS 

 

  The universal present in the contracted forms of God and matcid

ter is  an  eternal abstract oscillation  within self or  the  pure  thought 
of self  The oscillation within self is  the simple  Notion of utility 

  Utility is  a bad word to faith sentiment and speculation but 
it  expresses  the  ultimate  truth  of  enlightenmentendless  restless 
oscillation  from  one  thing  to  another  Pure  insight  is  the  existent 
Notion  whose  beinginself is  not  abiding  being  but  a  perpetual 
beingforanother 

  Summary The world of culture ends in  the  consciousness  of 

its own emptiness and vanity selfconsciousness retreats into self passcid
ing  into  the  two  forms  of faith  and  antifaith  or  enlightenment 
Faiths imaginative pictures  perish  in  the onslaught of pure insight 
which  circles  between  the  two  empty  poles  of the  supreme  being 
negative  and  matter  positive  Craving  the  reality  which  these 
abstractions exclude selfconsciousness  turns to the real world it has 
forsaken  and  finds  its  own  reflection  in  the  universal  usefulness  of 
everything to  everything  The  three  worlqstraversed  by  Spirit are 
therefore    the dispersed  world of culture in all  its  rich specificity 
and its hidden basic genus  b  the genus  behind this world seen as 
faith and insight  c  the reconcilia tion of the genus with the specjfic 
forms  in  utility  In  utility  the  ratiolal  universtJl  is  united  wi th  the 
individual and his satisfaction and heaven is  brought down to earth 

ABSOLUTE  FREEDOM  AND  TERROR 

sg  Consciousness  has  seen  its  very  Notion  in  tltility  which  is 
however still envisaged as a  predicate of the object of consciousness 
or as  End of its  pursuit and not as  its  veritable beilgforself  There 
is  JlOwever  an  implicit  withdrawal  from  objectivity  in  the  Notion 
of the  useful  and  when  this  withdrawal  hecomes  more  explicit we 
have as  a  new form  of consciotlsnessabsolute freedom 

  In utility all that intrinsically matters in objects is  their  use 
for  some self  ie  their  use  for  a  subject  inherently  universal  which 
sees  itself in  the superficially alien being of the objects it uses  When 
the seeming  distinction  of supject  object  and  interaction  hetween 
them is  overcome  absolute selfklowledge  results 

  Spirit knowing itself in all its uses  is  absolute freedom which 
sees  nothing sensuous  or supersensuous  beyond  itself  The  world  is 
its  will  and this  will  is  a  general  will  the  will  which  is  a  real  will 
and not capable of being mediated by a representative This general 
will is the true will the selfconscious essence of any and every person 
so  that each does  what all  do and vice  versa  Rousseau 

Vl  SPI RI T   

  This general will pu ts itself on the throne of the world withou t 

resistance  Since selfconsciousness  is  the  principle  behind  all separcid
ately organized social masses all these masses collapse into the unicid
tary will which expresses selfconsciousness What gave the selfthinkcid
ing Notion existence was its  diremption into separated sodal masses 
when  the  thinking Notion becomes  its  own explicit  object  all  such 
masses go  Each individual consciousness rises above the accidents of 
its class and place and desires only to perform the work of the whole 
All  differences  of rank and function  are annihilated 

  Utility as a predicate of a  real object vanishes when selfconcid

sciousness is its own only object  In this  phase of experience  there is 
no  room for  the distinction  between  the  individual and  the  general 
will The Ptre supreme is reduced to a gaseous phantasm floating above 
the wrecked  world of culture and faith 

  In the new fusion of individual with social will the individual 
can do nothing but enact laws  and  public  resolutions  and decrees 
  Consciousness thus exalted and universal in aim can achieve 

nothing positive either legislatively or executively  Its absolute negacid
tivity  excludes   differentiation  into  groups  having  different  state 
functions  legislature  executive  judiciary  or  into  the  variously 
aligned grlPS  in the  world of culture  Being committed only to  do 
the work  of the whole  the individual can  do  nothing at all 

Sg  But all deeds however universal  their source are necessarily 
the  deeds  of definite individuals  and not of everyone  Only  purely 
negative  destructive  work  can  therefore  be  the common  work  of 
wholly free  consciousnesses 

  Selfconsciousness beingselfconsciousness cannot avoid the 
differentiation  which  selfconsciousness  involves  If it  abolishes  aU 
groups it still  keeps  the  distinction  between the inflexible  universal 
and thedirempted individual atoms The only relation between these 
two  extremes  can be  one  of pure  negation  the  universal  will  must 
seek the death of its individuaLinstances and this in the most brutal 
and direct and senseless way 

  The government is  necessarily individual since  only so  can 
it  will  anything  definite  But  an  individual  structure  necessarily 
departs from  its  own ideal of being  the universal will  and  becomes 
the will ora factionwhich may readily be replaced by another faction 
It cannot escape the guilt of violating its own principles  Such guilt 
being devoid of any objectiveprinciple is indistinguishablefrom mere 
suspicion and its  only fit  punishment is  simple annihilation 

  In  the work of destruction absolute freedom  discovers  what 
it is  Implicitly it is  the  abstract selfconsciousness  which uproots  all 
distinctions within itself  The terror  of death is  the  intuition  of the 
negative essence  quivering between  its  empty  absolute  poles  God 

 
and Matter The universal will pursuing nothing becomes the elimicid
nation of selfthinking selfconsciousness 

ANALYSIS 

  The  absolute  negativity  cannot  help  generating  class and 
positiondifferences  within  itself which  it ruthlessly  keeps  in  their 
place  by sheer  terror 

  From this reign of terror Spirit is  unable to return to  the concid

creteness of the realms of culture and faith  It is  universal will which 
in its  ultimate  abstractness  has  nothing  positive  left  in  it  The  uncid
fulfilled  negativity of the self  with its  senseless  pursuit  of death  is 
however  such  as  to  swing  over  into absolute  positivity  in  so  far  as 
the individual becomes  not something to  be  destroyed  by  the  unicid
versal  will  but to  be  taken  up into  it  as  pure  knowledge  and  pure 
will  the  Kantian formal  a priori 

  Absolute freedom has as its  positive outcome a purely formal 
moral will universal as much as individual The Kantian Categorical 
Imperative is  the other side of revolutionary destruction 

SPIRIT  CERTAIN  OF  ITSELF  MORALITY 

  We have advanced to a position where the individual person 
at first alienated from its own concept in the worlds of culture  faith 
and enlightenment and swamped by that universal  meaning inthe 
stage of revolutionary freedom  has achieved  unity with its  own incid
herent universality 

  The individuals relation  to  his  own spiritual  universality  is 
both immediate and mediate  His immediate in  that the individual 
simply knows his duty and does it But it is  mediate inthatthe indivicid
dualdoes not do his duty as an unreflecting member of the total ethical 
substance nor as  an alien prescription of an external authority hut 
in  that he understands and sees  why he should do as  he should  do 
This  deep  rational  understanding  abolishes  all  otherness  and 
becomes  the whole being of the  ethical world 

  At the rnorallevelonly what is known and present to the COncid
scious agent makes any sense or has any reality The world as an uncid
known external set of facts of Nature has  been  transformed into the 
world as  a  known springboard for  action 

THE  MORAL  ViEW  OF  THE  WORLD 

  Selfconsciousness in this phase makes duty the absolute subcid

stance and essence  which is  also  its  own  substance and  essence  and 
which cannot assume  the form  of anything alien  To  this  substance 
an otherbeing must stand opposed a  Nature morally  meaningless 
governed  by laws  that have nothing to  do  with  morality 

  A  moral outlook  develops  in  which  the intrinsic  being and 
selfconsciousness of morality stands in a relation ofstark indifference 

VI  SPI RIT  

 

to the intrinsic being and selfconsciousness of Nature The moral and 
natural orders are for it given as mutually independent and irrelevant 
From another point of view however only duty counts  the  natural 
order being dependent and unessential  The moral life  develops  the 
conflict of these  two  points  of view 

  From  the former  point  of view  the  moral  consciousness  is 
satisfid by the mere performance of duty the natural setting merely 
provides  the occasion  for  this  performance  and  it  mayor may  not 
reward the performance with complete success and happiness From 
the latter point of view  which  is  not purely moral  it is  a  matter of 
complaint and regret that the natural order so  often  fails  to  match 
the  demands of duty and  the  requirements of justice 

  The moral consciousness cannot satisfy itself in the fulfilment 
of an impersonal universal purpose it necessarily demands also  that 
the  individual person  be satisfied  Nature  it is  felt  must come  into 
line with  morality  and reward  the  moral  individual with  personal 
satisfaction From the strictly moral poin tof view  Nature has no true 
self to oppose to  the demands ofmoraHty and its conformity to  these 
demands  is  accordingly  postulated  This  postulation  goes  beyond 
present actualities  but is  not  a  contingent  personal  demand  It is 
a  necessary demandof Reason 

  Therooral consciousness not merely demands Nature as somecid
thing completely external and alien in whichi t operates but as somecid
thing also present in itself in  the form of contingent sensuous  urges 
and tendencies directed to specific and individual ends  These urges 
and  tendencies constitute an  internal  opposition  to  the  purposes  of 
the  pure  will  The  moral  consciousness  remains  one  consciousness 
however and in virtue ofthis unity is obliged to terminate the conflict 
between its  pure self and its  contingent sensuous  urges  its  essence 
lies  in ending such  a  conflict  But  the  conflict  cannot be  ended  by 
uprooting  the  sensuous  urges  since  they  are  the  real  element  in 
morality I troust accordingly be ended by making the urges conform 
to moral req uiremen ts This harmony of urge with morality isa postucid
lated harmony not as beforeinthe nature of things but as a harmony 
consciousness must  itself bring about  in  an  endless  moral  progress 
The harmon y itself is placed at infinity sinceifitcameabou t it would 
terminate morality  It is  not really what we want to achieve  though 
it must be  absolutely  carried  out  it is  a  task  that  must  be  carried 
out without ever ceasing to bea task  Infinity is a  good place for such 
contradictory accommodations 

  OUf  first  postulate  was  that  of  an  inherent  harmony  of 

morali ty with external Nature our second that of a selfconscious harcid
mony of morality  with  internal  nature  or sensuous  impulse  These 
two harmonies are brought together in the actual movement of action 

 
and each  appears required  by  the other  We have a  harmony  both 
inherent and for  consciousness 

ANALYSIS 

  The moral consciousness has to function in relation to an actucid

ality that presents many distinct cases in relation to  these it breaks 
up into a variety of laws and duties  presupposing different objective 
and subjective situations These laws of detail have not the sacrosanctcid
ness of morality as such and have to be referred to another consciouscid
ness  than  the one  that prescribes  the moral ideal as  such 

  There are therefore two moral consciousnesses one prescribcid
ing a law of duty indifferent to special content and the other particucid
larizing this  law into special  rules  Thissecond moral consciousness 
also has  the  task of harmonizing morality with  happiness  What we 
here necessarily have is the conceptof a moral worldruler who pluralcid
izes  duty  and connects it with happiness 

  In actual conduct however the agent is always an individual 

concerned to achieve a result in the real world He refers the unpluralcid
ized law of duty to another conSCIousness  that of a sacred lawgiver 
This  is  a  strain of the  dialectic opposed  to   

  Themoralagent since he places the pure law of duty heyond 
himselfina perfect lawgiver necessarily thinks of himself as imperfect 
in knowledge  and will  and a  victim  to  the contingent and the sencid
suous  He is  unworthy to  receive happiness and can  receive  it only 
through the operation of Grace 

g  The Notion oCa full conformity to duty is  necessarily  postu
ated by the imperfect moral agent and he thinks of such a perfection 
as  meting out desert according to  merit 

  The  moral  consciousness  locates  its  moral  ideal  in  another 
being  pardy as a mere representation in its own mind pardy as some 
thing which in its perfection  would  transcend morality 

 I  The  moral consciousness  does  not see  its  own  Notion in  the 
divine lawgiver nor does it recognize itself as the conceptwhkh links 
aU these opposed moments with one another It operates with picturecid
thoughts rather than pure Notions  Its object is  treated as something 
merely existent which irrupts  upon it in picturepresentation 

   The moral consciousness also sees  its own intrinsic Notion in 
a  quasitemporal  perspective  as  an  original  state  of  perfection  to 
regain  which  is  the aim of the world 

  The result of these transcendent projections is  that the moral 
consciousness is one of infinite imperfection There is  for it no moral 
actuality 

  The accomplished moral actuality is for it merely something 

beyond 

  Both  the imperfect individual and  the  perfection  it aims  at 
thus  become  mere  presentations  each valid  only  from  the  point of 

V I SPI RI T S 

  
view of the other The complete moral selfconsciousness is and is not 
since it exists only in idea There is and can be no transcendent moral 
perfection  but an  ideal  of a  moral  transcendence  is  treated  as  if it 
were such a  perfection 

MORAL  DUPLCITY 

  In the moral view of the world consciousness consciously procid

duces its object ie the realm of duty This it does even ifi attributes 
some aspects of its ideal to a  transcendent  divine selfconsciousness 
  The moral view of the world now develops its basic contradiccid

tion in several  directions  It constantly regards one side  of its  being 
as a mere mask for the other while the latter in its  turn merely masks 
the  former  It  is  moreover  profoundly  conscious  of  its  shifting 
duplicity and pretence and its  basic  lack of seriousness 

  This  masking can  be  studied  in  the  postulated  harmony of 
morality and Nature  This is  not given  as  actual now  but as  to  be 
actualized through moral action  But in so far as it is  brought about 
and the result enjoyed by the agent there ceases  to  be  the  transcen 
dently postulated harmony  and  the  postulation  thereofis  therefore 
shown  up as  insincere  We only  postulate  the  ultimate harmony  to 
inspire  presen taction 

  If our postulation of ultimate harmony is  insincere our imcid

mersion  in action  must be sincere  But the  End of action is  not  the 
individual act  but  the  total  betterment of the  world  to  which  the 
act  makes  only  a  negligible  contribution  But  to  place  the  End  in 
worldbetterment is  also  insincere since  the  performance of duty  is 
the essence of action and the onlyreaUyworthwhile thing inthe world 
But again  the performance ef duty essentially relates  to  the world of 
Nature  moral laws  must become laws  of Nature 

  If  however  the highest good  is  taken to  be a  Nature which 
conforms  to  morality  morality  itself vanishes  from  this  good  since 
it  presupposes  a  nonconforming  Nature  Moral  action  being the 
absolute  purpose seems  to  look  to  the  elimination  of moral  action 
  Morality presumes that morality and reality are in harmony 
but not seriously since it proceeds to bring them into harmony  But 
it is  not serious in doing this  since  its  action is  a  mere  means  to  the 
highest good But it is not serious with this good since it involves the 
des truction of moral action 

  Morality posits its  End as  freedom  of the  pure will from  the 
misleading power of sensuous impulses and tendencies  But in doing 
so  it cuts  its  connection with reality  since  impulses  and  tendencies 
alone  relate  us  to  reality  It therefore  postulates a  mere conformity 
of these impulses to  morality But morality cannot prescribe a  direccid
tion to the impulses which alone can give a definite content and direc

  

ANALYSIS 

tion to morality We have therefore to make the harmony of impulses 
and morality an idea of Reason located in  the infinite distance  But 
this  again  is  not  serious  since  it  would  involve  the  elimination  of 
morality in the struggle with the impulses and contingent desires The 
nonseriousness is  shown in the introduction of the Notion of infinity 
  It would seem that a state of moral progress  is  the true moral 
goal  But progress towards a  condition where  morality ceases  would 
be  moral  decay rather than  progress  The Notion of an  increase  or 
decrease in morality is  moreover inadmissible Either one acts duticid
fully  or one violates  duty  Stoicism 

  Since morality is always incomplete happiness can never  be 
deserved only granted by grace  Hence happiness is  an independent 
End having nothing to  do  with  morality 

  Since  morality is  always incomplete  it is  a  mere  expression 
of envy when people complain that the wicked flourish while the good 
suffer There are no good and no wicked and happiness should simply 
be as  widely spread as  possible 

  Pure morality inheres only in a  divine legislator who pluralcid

izes  duty  But nothing can pluralize duty  if our  moral insight  does 
not do so Noteven a holy being can sanctify what is not intrinsically 
holy  Nor can an arbitrary  being be  holy 

  The perfection of moral insight has to be located in a  divine 

legislator  untroubled  by sensuous impulses 

  Butcin sucha beingthemoralstruggle would vanishand hence 

aU  genuine  moral goodness 

Qg  In Godallthecontradictions of morality come to a head The 

moral consciousness  has  to  abandon God  and retreat into itself 

  The whole valid morality of God is  a  mere thing of thought 
and therefore without moral validity  Itis opposed to  reality and yet 
ought  to  be real 

 I  Consciousness aware of its  deep insincerity in all  these  posicid

tions  flees  to its own inwardness  and  takes  up  the  position  of pure 
conscence indifferent  to  all  these  transcendent questions 

CON SCI  NeE  THE  B E AUT IF U L     U L   EVIL  A N D  ITS 

FORGIVENESS 

  The  antinomy  of the  moral  worldview  has  given  us  duty 
located  in  the  beyond  but also  demanded  down  here  It has solved 
moral  con tradictions  by  displacing  them  into  some  other  transcid
cendent selfconsciousness  Now  however  the  moral sefconsciouscid
ness has reabsorbed this transcendent being into itself and recognizes 
itself as  absolutely valid in its contingency  Its  immediate particular 
existenceis  the  true reality and harmony 

 

  Theselfofconscience is  to be contrasted with its predecessors 

 
a  the self of the legal person whose existence  consists  in being ackcid
nowledged  by others  b  the  absolutely free  self which  is  the  endcid
product of the  realm  of culture  c  the  moral self involved  in  the 
oscillating  displacements  of universality  and  individuality  In  concid
science we for the first time give con tent tCthe empty pattern of duty 
right  and  the pure will  and lend it authentic existence 

  Conscience heals the various breaches across which moral discid
placement  has  woven  its  dialectic  the  breach  between  what  is  incid
trinsic  and  what  is  a  matter of myself  between  the  pure  End  and 
the opposed factors of Nature and sensibility  Conscience is  morality

arbitrament of some general standard 

  For conscience  Gewissen  the intrinsically right is  what it is 
inwardly sure of gewiss Itconverts the given case before it into some a 
thing which  consciousness  itself has  produced t  does  not dirempt

it must decide it alone can determine its duty in the concrete making

  At the threshold of the sphere of Spirit  we  were concerned 
with the honest consciousness  absorbed in  the  cause itself  which 

ANALYSIS 

 
was a  predicate of the subject rather  than  the subject itself  In concid
science  the  task or  cause  itself  is  the  subject  It includes  in  itself 
the aspect of social substantiality derived from  the ethical sphere the 
aspect of external authorization derived from  the sphere of culture 
and the selfknowing essentiality of morality In conscience the subject 
sees  all  these  moments  in  and  as  himself  and  seeing  them  as  his 
moments  he  has  power and sovereignty over them all 

  Conscience  tries  in  some  measure  to  consider  the  circumcid

stances and consequences of action in all their detail But it also knows 
and  is  not dismayed  by  the  fact  that  these  circumstances  and  concid
sequences ramifyinfinitely in all directions and that it is wholly futile 
to attempt to  take account of them all  in ones action  It is for  others 
to pursue the investigation of circumstances ever further  conscience 
must act  on  its  own  incomplete  knowledge  which  because  it is  its 
own  is  sufficient  and complete 

  Conscience has  to  consider all the prima facie  duties  WhICh 
come up in concrete cases  but none of them has authority for  it  It 
must determine which is overriding  In doing so its own naturalness 
its impulses and inclinations must playa part  Only this  can break 
through  the circle of inauthentic prescriptions derived from  others 
Conscience must exercise itsarbitramentandthismustrest ultimately 
on  its own impulsive and emotional makeup 

  It is  thearbi tramentof the  individual subject which  alone 
determines the content of duty in given cases Other individuals might 
regard this determinationas a fraud since they consider other aspects 
of  the  matter  An  action  that  seems  violently  unjust  to  others 
may he an act of justifiedselfassertion to  the person concerned  an 
action that others see as cowardly may be a  prudent conservation of 
oneself and ones usefulness  to  the man in question  Since  morality 
consists  merely  in  the  consciousness  of  having  done  ones  duty 
any  content  can  be  moral  and  must  be  recognized  as  such  by 
others 

  It is no good saying thatthe conent of conscience should have 
been otherwise  I ts  essence  is  arbitrariness  One cannot say  that  it 
should have been directed  to  the general rather than  the individual 
good for the general good only has definite meaning if one brings in 
the social laws which override individual conviction  and these concid
science will not admit  And any act the  individual does for  his  own 
good can be plausihlydefended as for  the good of alL  The balancing 
of goods against gopdsis  moreover something that conscience  by its 
essence  cuts  short 

  Conscience is Spirit sure of itself fully possessed and apprised 
ofits duty Anything which exists an sich is demoted toa mere moment 
it is  only in so far as  it knows  of it that it counts  Conscience  has no 

 
content  it must decide  whether  to  obey or disobey any law  It has 
the  power to  bind or loose 

VI  SPIRIT S 

  Conscientious acts exist as such for others  They are acknowcid
ledged as  conscientious  by other conscientious  persons  and are  Plt 
on  a  level  with  their  conscientious acts 

  There  is  however  always  some  doubt  whether  other  con 
sciences will endorse the determinations of the individual conscience 
Conscience therefore oscillateshopeessly between selfdoubt derived 
fropt  the  reactions of others and its  own selfcertainty 

  Conscientiouspeople trusting the integrity of their own concid
sciences  cannot  help  impugning  the  soidisant  conscientious  delivcid
erances  of others  and  thinking  that  they  are  products  of morally 
bad consciences 

  Only if an act is  truly  conscientious must it  be acknowledged 
as  morally right by  all  otherwise it counts as  a  mere  expression  of 
personal preference 

  Only a  mans  consciousness  of situations  notthe real result 
of his acts is  morally relevant and acknowledged as  such by others 
L  Language is the medium in which Spirit or social subjectivity 
exists Through lallguage one personalEgo recognizes the Egostatus 
of another personal Ego and so transcends itsseparate individuality 
  In moral discourse the moral consciousness loses itsrlumbness 
and becomes universaJ One man utters his conviction of duty which 
is  understOQd  as  such  by others  Nothing  counts  except  that  others 
are assured  that the  man himself is  assured of doing his  duty 

  The conscientious agent cannot admit ques tions as  to whether 

orlot he is acting from a  true sense oLduty since he admits no discid
tinctions of absolute duty from theindividuaPs conscious determinacid
tion  of it  If a  man says  he is  acting conscientiously  he is 

f  Conscienceinits sublime majesty can put what content it wills 
into its kpowingand its  willing  Itis the moral genius  which knows 
the voice of its inner intuition to be divine Itis likewise the creativity 
that can make any action to be right To follow conscience is to praccid
tise  a  religion  of selfworship 

  This lonely religion is also communal and holds  for  all who 

speak the language of conscience and are conscientiously pure in purcid
pose 

  This sort of pure conscientiousness  is  wholly  empty  One is 
assured  of always  being  right without regard  to  what  one  is  right 
about Consciousness the relation of mind to something objective has 
vanished into empty selfconsciousness  and  what we  have  is  really 
the  untruth of the  moral consciousness  rather than its  truth 

  What emerges out ofthis emptying of morality is the Iheautiful 
soul which is  too fine  to commit itself to  anything  It lacks force  to 

ANALYSIS 

externalize itself and endure existence  It does not want to stain the 
radiance of its pure conscientiousness by deciding to do anything parcid
ticular It keeps its heart pure by fleeing from contact with actuality 
and preserving its impotence  Its activity consists in yearning and it 
is  like  a  shapeless  vapour fading into  nothingness 

  Concience has yet to be considered as acting  It gives empty 
universal duty a  determinate content drawn from  its  own  self  and 
from  that self as  a  natural individuality 

  Selfcertainty is the primary fact for conscience the universal 

Ansich  takes  a  second  place  For  the  universal  consciousness  reprecid
sented by other people the absolute certainty of conscience is  essenticid
ally evil  and hypocritical 

 I  The universal moral consciousness represented by the others 
tries  to  unmask  the  hypocrisy  of the  individual  conscience  It tries 
to show  that the  universal  impersonal language of morality is  both 
used  by the conscientious person and also serves  to  disguise  his  percid
sonal contempt for  that universality 

  There is an inherent incompatibility between the impersonal 
universality ofconscious utterances and the claim to obey ones own 
private standards To be impersonal about confessedly personal stancid
dards is  to abuse others 

  But when  the impersonal  moralist  condemns  private  concid
scientiousness as hypocritical base etc he merely sets  uponearbicid
trary personal standard against another  He  in  fact  legitimizes  the 
conscience he attacks by  taking issue with  it 

 Thejudgementofuniversal morality is unwilling to enter the 
arena of action and remains snug within the universality of thought 
It  thereby  itselfexhibits  hypocrisy  since  it  wishes  its  impeccable 
judgements to  do duty for  hazardous deeds 

  Thejudgementofuniversalmorality is itself a  mode of action 
and  its  main  concern  is  to  denigrate  mens  conscientious  acts  by 
explaining them byin teres ted motives like ambition desireforhappicid
ness moralvanity etc No act can escape judgement in such denigracid
tory  terms  no hero can  be  a  hero  to  his  valethecause  the latter is 
a  valet 

  The exalted consciousness whichjudges the active individual 
can itself be convicted of hypocrisy  It is  afraid  to act  and it passes 
off its cowardice as a  wonderful  piece of insight  The  man of action 
sees  his judge correctly as  but another agent and humbly confesses 
his  imperfections  to  him 

  Butthis confession of moral inadeq uacyis hot met by a similar 
confession  on  his judges  part  the judge  remains  stiffnecked  and 
hardhearted Such a retention of uncommunica dng beingforself in 
theface of the others renunciation of the same denies the very nature 

VII  RELIGION  

 

of Spirit which is  master and lord  over every  deed and reality and 
can make any of them  as  if it had never  been 

  The heautifulsoul represents no accommodation of the clash 
here considered It simply passes away in yearning  It does not insist 
on its own beingforself and merely sinks down to unassertive soul 
less  being 

  The  true  accommodation  of the  two  sides  just  mentioned 
occurs when the moralist drops his attitude of stiffnecked judgement 
and  matches  the confession of inadequacy of the  practical man 

  The recognition of himself  the moralist in  the erring practi 
cal  agent  involves  an  act  of reconciliation  and  forgiveness  which 
simply is  Absolute Spirit showing itself between the two antagonists 
  The Notion of pure duty and  tainted individual practice are 
two sides of the same Notion in seeming opposition They are the I  
I where the Ego knows itself in its absolute other another Ego  This 
is the first full appearance of God the object of religion on the pheno 
menological stage 

VJI  RELIGION 

  jitherto in  Consciousns Selfconsciousness  Reason  and 
Spirit therehllve been manifold consciousnesses of the Absolute  The 
Absolute Being has  not  however  been  aware of itself in  them 

  The supersensible  inner  essence  postulated  by  the  scientific 
understanding was  the  Absolute  but certainly  not  a  case  of Spirit 
aware oLSpirit  The  Unhappy  Consciousness  yearned  towards  the 
Absolute but did not tecognizethe Absolute as itself  Reason missed 
the Absolute because it found itself in what was immediately before 
itself 

  In the religion of the ethical order fate was an impersonal faccid

tor distinct from  aU  sevesthey  could  not  recognize  themselves  in 
it The spirits of the deadon the other hand may have putoffimmecid
diat particularity but had not yet achieved true  universality 

  The  religion  of the  Enlightenment  had  an  empty  Absolute 
quite beyond the wholly satisfactory  present  It emphatically failed 
to  see itself in  its  Etre suprenu 

  The religion of morality and conscience  involved an awarecid

ness of the inner universal self  but as  having all  differentiation  and 
all  actuality outside of itself 

  In religion  Spirit is  seifconsciolls  as  it is  not  in  the  phases 
outlined above I tsees itself objectively as  a  universal Spirit compre 
hendingall essence and all actuality It may have an objective natural 
shape  but this  is  also wholly  transparent 

ANALYSIS 

  Religion does not however com pletely unify the actual world 
with the self of which it is  conscious but seems to have only a  partial 
connection with that world to be clothed by worldly forms as an Quter 
garmen t  I t does not yet see those worldly forms  in all  their indepencid
dent actuality as  simply Spirit itself 

  Religion  presupposes  all  the  previous  shapes  of Consciouscid

ness  Selfconsciopsness  Reason  and Spirit  But  though  it contains 
them an in  unity and not successively  yet  as  individually  realized 
in  the world  it must realize  them in succession 

  The stages which lead up to religion recur in religion as  specid

cifically religious phases out of which religion in its fullest realization 
arises 

 I  In religion the principles of the prereligious stages no longer 
occur in isolation We do not have a set ofliriear advances punctuated 
by nodes  but each  node  sums  up all  the advances  which  occur at 
other nodes and so is the centre of a radiating system We have always 
ie  the whole  progression  but with  one phase emphatic 

  In  developed  religion  consciousness  is  selfconsciousness 
but not so  at less  developed  stages  There Spirit first  contemplates 
itself in an immediate natural form  into which  it then  puts  its  own 
creative life  ie  the ArtReligion of Greece  In Revealed  Religion 
finally  Spirit is  itselfgiven  to  itself  but only  in  a  form  suitable  to 
picturethought From this it must rise  to  aselfconsciousness  in  the 
pure medium of thought 

NATURAL  RELIGION 

  Religion is existence embraced in thought or thought which 
is  there for  itself  Only in  thespecific  way  in  which  this  pattern  is 
realized does  one religion  differ from  another  All  are phases  in the 
development of religion as such In this development picturethinking 
is  steadily reduced  In all stages  of religious  development  there  are 
rudiments or residues ofwhat is present at other stages eg  the unity 
of universality wi th individualityfully realized in a Christian incarnacid
tion is rudimentarily prefigured in the incarnations of other religions 
But though all religions contain all sides of religion we must not concid
fuse rudiments or residues with the full expressions Only when Spirit 
is at a certain stage does  the religious presentation of that stage have 
full  truth 

THE  GOD  OF  LIGHT  PERSIA 

  Spirit at first has  the consciousness of itself as  being all  truth 
and all reality in the form of a  mere concept a  dark night of essence 
opposed  to  its  daylight forms  a  creative secret of birth  This secret 
must be externalized seen  in  and  through  all  daylight forms 

VII  RELIGION g 

 

  In its first immediate diremption  absolute  Spirit appears  to 
itselfin the manner ofsensecertainty It appears as a being pervaded 
by Spirit but Spirit in the form oflordship or mastery the immediate 
as opposed to  the inwardly withdrawn form of selfconscious ness  Its 
shape is in fact shapelessness the allembracing light of the morning 
which shows itselfin the forms  of Nature  but continues  to  play  uncid
committedly over them 

  This life of uncommitted surfaceplay never truly returns  to 
self nor makes its manifestations truly its own these latter are merely 
its  attributes  its  myriad  names  its  selfless surfaceornaments 

  This  incoherent life  must rise  to  selfconsciousness  and  give 
firm subsistence  to  its  vanishing forms  It must come  to  know  itself 
as  itself  Firm subsistence  must  be  dissolved  in  the  gamut  of forms 
it lays  before  the individual 

PLANT  AND  ANIMAL  INDIA 

  Religion goes on from seeing itself in the immediacies of sensecid
certainty to  perceiving itself in a  variety of independent forms  first 
blameless and vegetable then vicious and animal These animal spirits 
become locked  in a  combat unto death with one another 

  Out  of  the  selfcancelling  attrition  of  the  various  animal 
spidts  Spirit  sees  itself in  a  new  guise  that  of an  artificer  behind 
objects Spirit does not as yet see itself in the material it works upon 
this  material  is  already  determinate  and  preexistent  and  Spirit 
merely works  upon it 

THE  ARTIFICER  EGYPT 

  Spirit now appears as  an  artificer  which  puts  itself into  its 
product without knowing that  it  is  itself that it is  thus  producing 
It works  instinctively like  a  bee  building its  cells 

    The first products of Spirit are products of the Understanding 
obelisks  etc  in  which  the straight  predominates  and  the  round  is 
shunned Spirit imprisoned in these forms is  as it were dead external 
to  itself  not presen ted  as  Spirit 

  Spirit now moves to a  better representation of itself in which 
soul is  clothed by body and not merely working on it ah  extra  At the 
same time it sees  this  union externally  and so  remains hidden from 
itself 

  Spirit  takes  plant forms  and  stylizes  their  freedom  into  the 
straight  and  the  round  the  severe  universals  of  thought  and  the 
elements of free  architecture 

  Spirit mirrors its  own  individuality  in  animal  forms  which 
are however also hieroglyphs ofthought and not given as  endowed 
with language Even when they rise to the human shape they are still 

 
inarticulate and require  the  breath of morning  to  draw  from  them 
a  tone not a significant word  As morning from the lips of Memuon 
drew rivers  of melodies 

ANALYSIS 

  The artificer himself lingers darkly in the background when 
he does  represent himself it is  in  the  shapelessness  of a  black  stone 
  The artificer conscious of the conflict between his withdrawn 

self and  the outer product expresses  this  conflict  in  a  sphinx  halfcid
animal and halfhuman  articulate hut only in wise  riddles 

  S piri t now brings itself explici tly in to the prod uc tit crea tes and 
becomes an artist instead of an artificer It creates a product in which 
its  own selfconsciousness  is  manifest 

THE  RELIGION  OF  ART  GREECE 

  Spirit puts itself into a  shape  which  is  that of selfconscious 
Spirit  it no  longer goes  in for  incongruous  mixtures  of the  natural 
and  the  thinking 

  The religion of Art is closely connected withthe ethical Spirit 
Not a  blind adoration of mastering light nor an attrition of warring 
castes inspires it but the life of a  free  people whose  customs are also 
the will of all 

 I  In the ethical stage however Spirit has  not as  yet  retreated 
inwardly  from  its  contented  acceptance  of its  position  ina society 
where  all  have different  duties  It must  come  to  detaeh itself from 
this  happy life  of custom  and must come  to  mourn over the loss of 
happiness and security  before  it can  rise  to  true  art 

  Absolute art is a  product of the breakup of merely customary 
society  Previous  art was  merely  instinctive  not  a  product  of free 
Spirit 

  Spirit as  artist banishes all that  is  colourful and substantial 
from its expression I t wan ts only to express itself the fathomless nigh t 
of selfconsciousness in which the ethics oCcustom is  betrayed  Geth 
semane  All  that  it is  interested  in  is  form  alone  White  marble 
conception of Greek art due to  their loss  of colour 

  Spirit as artis t chooses an individual subJectmatter and there 
is  pathos  in such  a  choice  The  universality of Spirit  is  dominated 
by the exigencies of the individal hut these in their turn dominate 
unformed matter  In the end we  have Spirit presented  in breathing 
individuality and sensuous  presence 

THE  ABSTRACT  WORK  OF  ART 

  The first work of art is  abstractly individual  because immecid
diate  It must move away from such individualized art towards selfcid
consciousness  which  in  the  religious  cult  overcomes  the  otherness 
of its  religious  object 

V L  RELIGION g 

 

  The artistic product the statue of the god  stands out as  an 
individual on the universal background that surrounds it and houses 
it  It has  a  form  which avoids  the straight lines  of the  Understanda 
ing  and  the  incongruous  imitative  mixture  of straight  and  curved 
derived  from  vegetable  shapes  in  Egyptian  art  It rejoics in  the 
incommensurability  of the  straight  line  and  the  curve  and  uses 
both 

  The typical form produced by the artreligion is  an idealized 
human form whose semblance of animal functions stops at the forms 
surface Such an idealized human form unites natural existence with 
selfconscious Spirit It may contain residues of old  untamed forcescid
the  Titans etcbut aU  is  dominated by a  spirit which is  also  that 
of a  free  selfconscious  people 

  The restless variety of actual individuals is  brought to peace 
in the idealized individuality of the sculptured god  In this however 
the artist expresses none of his  own  tortured  individuality  But  the 
work of the artist or the onlooker is  as  essential to  the aestheticsituacid
tion as  the  mere  artobject 

  The artists creative efforts  are inadequately shown forth  in 
the artobject When others admire his creation and eveD kneel before 
it  the  artist recognizes  his superiority  to  it and  to  them 

 I o  Selfconscious Spirit therefore seeks a  more adequate artistic 
expression than the mere artobject This it finds  in language which 
is simply selfconscious existence in its immediacy where production 
is  one with  product  The hymn is  the essential artform  into  which 
spirit puts its  selfconsciousness  and it is  a  selfconsciousness shared 
by all who join in  the singing 

  I  We may however observe that oracular utterance is an even 
more  primitive religious  expression  of Spirit  than  the  hymn  Spirit 
has in it  however  not risen  to  universal  selfconsciousness  and so 
takes  the oracular sayings to spring from  an alien  selfconsciousness 
Oracles tend to  match the stage of spiritual evolution achieved eg 
in the ancienteast they utter sublime generalities which seem trivial 
to  developed consciousnesses 

  In the religion of Art universal  truths are not proclaimed in 
oracular fashion butarediscovered by each mans reflection Oracles 
utter  the  contingencies  whether of fact or practice  that  cannot  be 
effectively discovered  Socrates daemon only  told  him  trivial  matcid
ters  leaving him to  think out the great generalizations 

 I   After the digression of  I  I and  I   the hymn is  contrasted 
with the statue the latter being extruded from the self and reposefully 
out there while the hymn forms  part of the life  of the self and has 
the vanishing character of that life 

 I   In the religious cult the god loses his immobile outthereness 

ANALYSIS 

and the worshippers cease to be humble suppliants before their gods 
The god comes down from his  pedestal and the worshippers actively 
commune with him 

 I   The  abstract  cult  makes  the  soul  into  the  temple  of  the 
divinity not merely someone striking attitudes before a divinity which 
he contemplates from without The Greeks were not however sufficid
ciently conscious  of their remoteness  from  divinity  their  sinfulness 
and thought a change into white garments and a few  penances could 
purify  them 

 I   The religious cult involves an actual rite and cannot be carried 
ou t on the plane of mere thought In this rite the divine essence comes 
down into actuality and  becomes  one with  the self 

 I    In the cult natural objects bread and wine are given a divine 
meaning and a  divine  meaning is  given  concreteness and  actuality 
  The cult begins with the sacrifice  of objects which represent 
a  mans own  personality and  possession But the  god  also  makes  a 
sacrifice firstly in creating the sacrificial object and secondly in entercid
ing  the sacrificer as  he eats  the  sacrificial elements 

 J  A cult is  most fully and abidingly realized in the construction 
of a  great temple which is  not only a  dwelling for  the  divinity and 
its  treasures  but for  the use  and enjoyment of the citizens 

THE  LIVING  WORK  OF  ART 

  In  the  artreligion  the selfconsciollsness  of the individual  is 
one with that of the national Spirit not as in the lightreligion wholly 
subordinate  and lost  in  the latter 

 I  Selfconsciousness  in  the  artreligion  does  not  involve  the 

strain of the artist his dark struggle for expression His selfconsCiouscid
ness  is  not the  dark  but the  peaceful  night  the  night after sunset 
not before  dawn  The fruits  of Nature have  been quietly consumed 
and appropriated  by selfconsciousness 

  In the various  religious  mysteries  of Demeter  and  Dionysus 
bread and wine  mediate a  full  communion and revelation  of Spirit 
to  Spirit 

  In these mysteries the absolute Spirit unites with the selfconcid
sciousness of his  worshippers or the selfconsciousness of the latter is 
lost in  the  absolute Spirit 

  The Absolute in  these  mysteries  is  not  however  completely 
revealed  The mystery of the  bread and wine is  not  the  mystery  of 
flesh  and blood 

 

  At this level the Absolute as artist seeks a more adeq uate living 
embodiment not merely out there and unmoving like the sculptured 
god This it finds in the athletes matchless body displaying his powers 
at one or other of the great athletic festivals 

VII  RELGION  

  In the mysteries and the athletic games selfconsciousness has 

been made one with the absolute essence but not in a balanced mancid
ner In Bacchic revels the self has been rapt ou t of its body in athletic 
beauty spirit has become corporealized  In language alone can there 
be a perfect balance of interior and exterior This balanced language 
is  not  the  charged  speech  of llymns  and  oracles  but  the  luminous 
language  of literature  open  to  all  the  members  of a  contemporary 
culture 

THE  SPIRITUAL  WORK  OF  ART 

  Language  unites  the  various  distinct  national  spirits  into  a 
single  pantheon  in  which  however  there  is  considerable  looseness 
and independence not subjected  to  an overriding unity 

  The gods  preside over all  Nature  and society  their  chief is 
merely primus  inter pares  They represent various  aspects and powers 
of selfconsciousness  Their essential  unity  is  masked by  an external 
camaraderie 

  In the epic these various sides of selfconsciousness engage in 
a dialecticwhich takes the form ofa pictorial narrative The minstrel 
is thereal power which unites the whole picture bringing all together 
through the might of his  muse  Though not present in  the  narrative 
he  projects  himself into the  qeroes who occur in it 

 

  The various  aspects  of selfconsciousness  appear in  the  epic 
as  separate individuals  andJorces  including the dead all  sPlJrred 
into activity bysomeones cleed  Gods  and men repeat each  others 
work the divine  participants being redundant individuals instead of 
active  universals 

  The gods thus individualized quarrel with one another in a 
comic fashion All that presides over them and over men is  the unintelcid
ligible  power of necessity 

  Necessity really represents the power of the Notion operating 
through all these seemingly independent realities I t lurks in the backcid
ground jlSt like  the mintre Both must  however  be  brought into 
the  picture 

  This is what happens in tragedy where Janguage ceases to be 
narrative and where selfconscious human beings are thespokesmen 
behind whose  mask  actual actors are present 

  The  general  commentary  of the  epic  reappears  in  the  discid

course of the chorus of elders  These never reveal profound reflection 
or reaction but practise only general observations vague wishes and 
feeble  comfort  Before necessity  they  are blindly resigned  and  show 
only ineffective horror and  pity 

  In tragedy individuals are raised to heroic universality while 

ANALYSIS 

a vaguer commentatorial universality surrounds them in  the  chorus 
and spectators 

  The divine forces  in tragedy muster  about  the  two  poles  of 
the ethical order  the feminine  family  pole  on  the  one  hand  and 
the  masculine  governmental  pole on the other 

  The heroic agents in tragedy live divided between knowledge 
and ignorance Even the powers of light which give  them knowledge 
deceive them with ambiguous utterances which they completely trust 
Hamlet and  Macbeth are  more cautious 

  There are in tragedy two standards of right the daylight stancid

dard of Apollo  and  the  underworld standards of the  Furies 

  Zeus is  presented as  the ultimate reconciler and unity of the 

two  standards 

  Both forces  are  equally right and wrong  and  their struggle 
ends in the death of the individual concerned or his absolution from 
guilt  Both then  vanish in the calm balance of the ethical order 

  Even in tragedy Zeus tends to predominate over the separate 
ethical powers which become demoted to passions in the individual 
not impersonal principles which  pathetically crush him 

  Zeus and necessity become more and more the central figures 
in tragedy on whom the chorus looks with terrified awe as on somecid
thing quite alien 

  The selfconsciousness oftheherqes isgraduaUy passing beyond 

their supposed limitations ofvision and becoming deeply critical 

  In comedy the actor doffs  his  mask  and  the  individual self 
consciousness  reduces  everything to  mockery  even the  solemn  pro 
ceedings of the  gods 

  In  comedy  the  common  man  asserts  himself in  his  revolucid

tionary  disrespect  for  everything  But he also  makes  a  mock  of his 
own selfassertion 

  The dialectic of the  Sophists and Socrates is  a  continuation 

of the dissolving irony of comedy For conventional opinions and precid
scriptions it substitutes cloudy notions of goodness  and beauty 

 The truth ofcomedy is that all the great big essential fixtures 
that stand over against selfconsciousness are really products of  and 
at the  mercy of selfconsciousness The individual knows himself in 
his  individuality as  the Absolute 

REVEALED  RELIGION 

  The religion of art has made the great step of making its Absocid

lute a Subjectinstead of a Substance It has expressed itself in  forms 
that ofthestatue emblematic ofselfconsciousness and in the comic 
consciousness it has  reached a  pitch where all  including itsdf  is  at 
the  mercy of the  individual selfconsciousness 

VII  RELIGION  

  Spirit has inverted the view  of the self as  a  mere apanage of 
the absolute essence to making the latter in  the comic consciousness 
a mere apanage of the former It now inverts that inversion but withcid
out  returning  to  the  original  priority  of mere  Substance  set  over 
against selfconsciousness Since it consciously gives priority to the absocid
lute essence  the  absolute essence  continues  to  be itself  ie  selfconcid
sciousness ofwhichitjs in another form conscious We have therefore 
two coequal sides of sefconsciousness  instead of situations in which 
one  of these sides  takes  precegence over  the  other 

  The artreligion and the comic consciousness are the spirit of 
a time in which the ethical spirit is being eroded and pure individual 
ism  is  beginning  to  run  riot  This  is  a  period  of abstract right  like 
that of the early Roman Empire when religion has  lst  its  meaning 
and a  man lives  un o himself alone 

  Abstract right is  however  an  empty  abstraction  and  soon 
passes  over ipto yearning for  a  new Absolute  The Roman  Empire 
the  seat of Stoic strellgth of mind  becomes a  prey  to  the  Unhappy 
Consciousness 

  What is  to  the comic  consiousness a  vast joke is  to  the  Uncid

ANALYSIS 

  But Spirit must be aware of a  as much as of b ie it must 
see what immediately is  before it taking on  the  lineaments of Spirit 
This will  happen at a certain stage in worldhistory when Spirit sees 
itself in  the objective necessity of external  things 

  At a  certain  favourable  moment  in  history  the  belief arises 
note stress on beliefrather than event  that absolute Spirit has  taken 
on actual sensuous form  God is  taken  to  eist before  the  yearning 
conscious  mind  and  not  to  be  merely  a  projection  of it  And  God 
is  believed  to  exist as  an individual selfconsciousness 

  Gods being made man is  the simple content of absolute relicid

gion  Spirit is  knowledge  of self in  selfabandonment  and absolute 
religion  knows  God as  Spirit  Absolute  religion  is  revealed  religion 
because  in  it God  is  revealed  and  revealed  as  essentially  sefcon 
scious  We do not achieve  absolut religion  as  long as  the  object  of 
religion  is  other than  the Subject is  thought of merely  as  the  abso 
lutely good creator of heaven and earth etc  God must know  God 
in  religion   he must know himselfin  the  religious  person 

  To be conscious ofhimselfin a finite senuous human indIvicid

dual does  not represent a  descent for  God but the consummation of 
his  essence  For God  is  not  meely an  abstract  being  rmte from 
concrete sensuous instantiation he is only fully and compltely himcid
self in  an instance 

  Revealed relion is one with spculativeknowJe both 
attain to the knowledge of the universal as essentially intQendiviq ul 
This is  the  message for which all previosages were  thirting 

  The  individuation  of  the  absolut  essence  is  however 
picturd as achieved only in one case  lesu not equally in  all ie 
it is  not truly a  universal notional selfconsciousness which is  eyerycid
ones equally  Men are conceived as a lotof perceptible indivicillals 
not as  a single concept 

  But the single exemplification of the absolute essence must die 
in  time in order to become something in  which  all  men  can share 
If Christ does not go the Holy Ghost cannot come to the worshippig 
community 

  The  passing  of  Christs  life  iqto  the  remote  past  merely 

pictures its  translation  to  the plane of universal  meanings 

  The religious conscioqsness think tbe truth in piCJres  which 
give a fase  independence  to  the varioussides of what it believes  in 
These  pictures have  to  be  given  a  notional  reinterpretation 

  The religious consciousness goes astray when it substitutes for 
its own rich life  the brooding upon a historical figure and  particular 
events in  the  past 

  Spirit is essentially a  process which starts from  pure  thoght 
logic goes on into otherness and pictorial presentation Nature and 

VlI  RELIGION  

returns from Nature to completeselfconsdousness Spirit proper It 
is  also  essentially  the synthetic connection of these  three phases 

  In the unhappy and believing consciousnesses there was a parcid

tial selfcollsciousness  of Spirit  Spirit however  mistakenly referred 
itself to  a sphere beyond the  conscious subject 

  Spirit conceived in the element of pure thought is meaningless 
unless it also becomes manifest in something other than its  pure self 
and returns  to itself out of such otherness 

  God  is  there  manifes t  firstly  as  the  Essence  the  Father 
secondly as  the Beingforself for whom  the  Essence  is  the  Logos  or 
Word which made  the realm of Nature and  thirdly  as  the Beingcid
forselfwhich knows itself in  the other the Spirit or principle of selfcid
consciousness  

 I  Pictorial  religion  turns  the  necessary  relations  of essential 
moments  within  the  Absolute  into  external  generative  relations  of 
paternity and sonship 

  The relation of the  Absolutes  moments  in  the  pure  thought 

of the Absol u te is a  relation of pure love in which the sides we distincid
guish are not really  distinct  But it is  of the essence  of Spirit  not  to 
be a  mere  thing of thought  but to be concrete and actual 

  Since the element of purt thought is  abstractit  necessarily 
passes over into thcrealm of intuitive picturethought ie  the realm 
of Nature  There  one  has  a  plurality  of substantial  things  and  a 
plurality of thinking subjects 

  This passing over into the world of intuitive  picturethought 
is  what  is  pictorially  called  creation  The  absolute  universality 
requires instantiation to be what it is and ids this logical requirement 
which  is  misleadingly pictured as  a  temporal requirement 

  Spirit not only instan tia tes itself in objec ts but also in subjects 
These are at first not conscious of themselves as spiritual and hence 
are  innocent  rather  than  good  Their  first  sefconsciousness  is  as 
capable of evil  as  of good  This  first  selfconsciousness  is  pictorially 
misrepresen ted as  a  historical  fall 

  Evil is  the  first  actual  expression of the  dirempted selfconcid

sciousness  but it is  the one that selfconsciousness as  it deepens must 
more and more repudiate  Pictorially  therefore  it is  referred  back 
to  an infinitely remote date  to  the fall  from  heaven of Lucifer  son 
of the  morning  The  angelic  hosts  enter  the  picture  as  a  valuable 
pluralization of thebeingforsef of the Word  Ifwe add them to the 
Trinity we  get aqua ternity   and if we add  the fallen  angels  we  get 
a quinity  Counting in  theology is  however  a  bad  practice  Note 
Hegels incorporation of Evil into  the  Absolute 

  Pictorial religious  thought tends  to  extrude evil from  God 
exceptinso far as with great difficulty it credits God with a wrathful 

 
side  The activity of God can  be nothing but a  bringingtogether of 
the  dirernpted world with his  simple  essence  each  of which  is  onecid
sided  without the  other 

ANALYSIS 

  Pictorial religion treats the redemption of the aliena ted world 
as  an  act  of arbitrary  free  will  But  in  reality  the  absolute  essence 
would be abstract and unreal ifit did not exercise itselfredemptively 
ifit did not en ter the sphere of alienation and overcome the alienation 
This it does by living and then dying accepting the burden of sensuous 
instantiation and rising  above it  to  pure  universality 

  That  God  becomes  alienated  from  himself  in  angelic  and 
human evil  does  not mean  that such evil  really  lies  outside of God 
To be distant from God is to be distantly God  nothing can lie outside 
of the Absolute Being  The selfcentred ness  the  Insichgehen  which is 
the  root  of evil  is  an  essential  moment in  the  life  of the  Absolute 
This religion  recognizes  in making God  redeem  the  alienated  selfcid
centred beings Evil is in a deep sense the same being  forself as  absocid
lute  good  yet  in  a  deeper  sense  it  is  not  the  same  since  in  fully 
developed  being  forsef  evil  will  beset aside  and  overcome  The 
true selfishness will drive out the  untrue  It is  above all  mistaken in 
this  sphere to speak  in terms  of fixed  identity and  diversity  and  to

in Spirit 

  Spirit is  mostessentiaUy  itself in  the  religious  community 
where  the  Divine  Man  or  Human  God  is  transformed  into  the 
members  universal  inward  chastening selfconsciousness 

  Evil lies  not so  much in  an abuse of natural  existence  as  in 
the very conception ofitas other than remote from Spirit  It is  only 
for  picturethought  that Nature is  at first  good  then  fallen  In  the 
Absolute there is no such history of phases only moments which entail 
one another 

  Evil  is  nothing but the  goingintoself out of the  immediacy 
of nature and is  accordingly  the  first  step  in  the  direction of good 
To be  evil  one  must  be  conscious  of the  norms  one  rebels  against 
and will ultimately obey  There is no element of chance in the goingcid
intouselfwhich leads  to  evil ids the  essential  movement of selfcon  
sciousness 

  Instead of seeing the redemption of the alienated world as incid
herently necessary threHgus consciousness sees it as due to a special 
event  Gods  incarnation  and  death  But it also  realizes  that death 
to be a resurrection the universal life of Spirit among the individuals 
in  a  religious  community 

  What is  really  meant by  the  passion  and resurrection  is  the 

VIII  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING  

elimination of pictorial particularity and its supersession  by the  life 
of thought An existent entity has become a Subject a universal selfcid

a  thought may live ODe with every mans deepest selfconsciousness 
  Spirit is the mover the moved and the motion  It is its nature 
to forgive and pardon evil to reconcile it with itself  But the religious 
community sees  this aU  in pictures 

  The religious consciousness never fully  identifies itself with the 
object of its  devotion  hut at best pictures itself as  coming together 
with tha t object at an indefinitely future date The religious community 
has  an  actual  father  its  own  action  and  knowledge  but a  merely 
felt  mother eternal love which will  one day  unite it with  God 

VIII  ABSOLUTE  KNOWING 

  In revealedreigionsefconsdousness is aware of itself in piccid
torial objective form  not as  yet as  selfconsciousness  It mpt  cancel 
this form and become aware of itself in all  the forms it has  hitherto 
taken up They mustnot merely be forms ofselfcosciousness form 
the  phenomenological observers  butfor sefconsciousnesshselfb 
must see howithasexternalized itselfin various objects and in seeing 
lis also  cancelled  the  externalizatibn  I tmust see  all  its  objective 
forms  as  itself 

  Theobjectofreligionis atfitst an immediate existence given 
in sensation  a  determinate  eistence given  in  perception  and  a 
notion given as behind the immediate  to the scientific lJnderstandcid
ing Consciousness must nOw grope forward to an undersanding of 
objects  in  the  form  of self  But  it  does  so  by  gradual  stages  and 
dirempts  itselfinto  a  number of distinct  mental  postures in  which 
separate sides of the object are gradually brought together 

  Consciousness assuming  the form of obsetvationreaches the 
point of seeing itself  the  Ego as  an external  thing  given to sensecid
perception  the bones of the skull 

 I  This view of the Ego as sensuous externality is  however also 

the view of external things as nothing butthe Ego The full  developcid
ment of this  realization  arises  at the stage of enlightenment or pure 
insight when things  are considered solely from  the point of view of 
their  utility to the subject 

  A further spiritualization of objective thinghoodoccurs in the 
moral selfconsciousness where the Egos seWcertainty extends to the 
whole of essential  being everything else  being a  mere  husk  As  the 

 

ANALYSIS 

oscillation of moral duplicity vanishes all objecve ends are absorbed 
in a  mans own conscientiousness 

  Spirit certain  of itself in  its  objective  existence  takes  as  the 
element of its existence nothing but the knowledge of self  That what 
it does is  in accord with its ideas of duty makes them its  duty  There 
is  still however  an opposition  between  pure duty and  the external 
world and what men in it do But with  the act of forgiving another 
this  last opposition vanishes  and in all  human action  the  Ego  only 
encounters  the Ego 

  In religion  this  knowledge  of Ego  by  Ego  becomes  explicit 
in  the  Incarnation  Ego  is  known  both  in  and  for  itself  and  by 
itself 

  In religion however the identification of Ego with Ego is still 
only  achieved  in  the  medium  of picturethought  A  less  pictorial 
identification was  achieved in  the  case  of the  beautiful  soul  whose 
pure  inwardness  really  amounts  not  merely  to  an  intuition  of the 
Divine but to the Divine intuiting itself  Only the opposition to  realcid
ization makes this last form  defective  We  must progress  to  a  knowcid
ledge of self not as a floating universal but in its particular externalcid

  Systentatic Science only appears when Spirit has  achieved a

  Consciousness must go  through a long process of first enrich

ing  its  object  poor  and  abstract  in  its  first  appearance  and  then 
appropriating  and  conceptually  reabsorbing  all  that  it  has  thus 
enriched The pure Notion presupposes all  these stages  that lead  up 
to  it  but consciousness  embraces  them  all  in  implicit  nonnotional 
form  Time  is  the  Notion  itself when  presented  to  consciousness  as 
an empty intuition and Spirit appears  to  itself in time till it achieves 
full  notional grasp and  thereby  abolishes  time  Time  is  the  destiny 
and  the  necessity  of the  as  yet  not  perfected  Spirit  ie  until  it  has 
overcome  the  externality of objective  Substance 

  Everything we know  must come  before  us  in  a  living  phase 
of experience Erfahrung  The substantial the solidly out there  must 
slowly be transmuted into the  notional  the subjective  Time simply 
is  the form of this selfrealizing process  Until Spirit reaches  the end 
of the requisite temporal process it cannot achieve complete selfconcid
sciousness 

  The final conceptualization and reduction to self of all objeccid

tivity began when the religious worldview of the Middle Ages  made 
way  for  the  postRenaissance  philosophers  These  ran  through  an 
observational phase in  Cartesianism a  unified  oriental  religionofcid
light phase in Spinozism an individualistic monadistic form in Leibcid
niz  Everything  became  further  subjectivized  in  the  utility  of  the 
Enlightenment and in the pure rational noumenal will of Kant  The 
subjectivization  became  more absolute  in  the  Ego  positingtheEgo 
of Fichte  and  the  dependent  construction  of both  time  and  space 
This leads on  to  the  imperfectly  carried  out subjectivization  of the 
substantial natural world  in  Schelling  the  natural  being externally 
and imperfectly  integrated with  the  Ego  in  one Absolute 

  The Ego must not however be afraid of the substantial world 
of  bjective Nature this is  its  foil  and  therefore  itself  The  power of 
Spirit lies  in  remaining one with  itself while  it  externalizes  itself in 
Nature  and  that without paring down  the  elaborate  distinction  of 
na tural being It m us t understand Nature in all its variety as necessary 
to  itself 

  Spirit is all the phases of content in which it externalizes itself 
and  the process of leading these  phases  back  to  a  full  consciousness 
of self  It unfolds  its  existence  and develops  its  processes  in  the  pure 
ether of its life  and is  Systematic Science  In Systematic Science  the 
distinction between subjective knowledge and objective truth is elimicid
nated  each  phase  always  has  both aspects 

  Systematic  Science  cannot however  remain  a  pure  concid

ceptual development it must step out of itself and see Spirit developed 
in  space  and  time  and in na ture 

  It must  then  study  Spirit  returning  to  itself in  time  ie  In 

the  long  procession of historical  cultures  and individuals

PHILOSOPHY 

 Hegel s Phenomenology was written so the story goes on  the eve of 
Napoleon s destruction  of the  Holy Roman  Empire and  at the  beg incid
ning  of  the  German  Wars  of  Liberation   The  book  itself  is  no  less 
dramatic  or  revolutionary  It  is  Hegels  grandest  experiment  changcid
ing  our vision  of the  world  and  the  very  nature  of the  philosophical 
enterprise 

 In  the  rig htfully famous  Preface Hegel lays out the  principles that 
define the  rest  of hi s work and so  much  ph ilosophy to follow  In  the 
Introduction  he  briefly  summarizes  the  argument  that  completes 
Kants  philosophical  revolution  rendering  skepticism  a  dead  issue 
and  id ealism  an  inspiring  call  to  change and  selfrealization  In  Concid
sciousness he anticipates  some of the  most  radical  insights of  concid
temporary  epistemology  defending  Kant and  Fichte and  moving  becid
yond  them  to  the  work  of  the  later  Wittgenstein  In  SelfConsciouscid
ness he provides a model of self and selfidentity wh ich begins a new 
era in philosophy inspiring Marx and Sartre and so many others And 
as he develops his symphony of  Reason Hegel puts into harmony ethcid
ics  and  autonomy ancient philosophy and tragedy  Byronic Romanticid
cism  German  poetry the  Enlightenment the French  Revolution the 
concept  of  virtue  the  hi story  of  religion  including  an  ambiguous 
defense and critique of modern Christianity the beginnings of a new 
philosophy  of  science  and  Kants  moral  philosophy  All  are  tied  tocid
gether with the  dazzling  if sometimes  bewildering  leaps  in  logic that 
have  come to  be  known  as  Hegels dialectic 

 No  one  can  read  this  book  without  feeling  that  he  or she  is  encid
counterin g  not  only  an  imp ortant  historical  document  but  a  living 
example of the finest powers of the philosophical  im ag ination
