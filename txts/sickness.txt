Despair is the sickness not the cure In Christian terminology death is 
the expression for the greatest spiritual sickness and the cure is simply 
to die to die from despair 

 

Introduction 

Only the Christian knows what is meant by the sickness unto death As 
a Christian he acquires a courage which the natural man does not 
know This courage he acquires by learning to fear the still more 
dreadful 

 

Part  The Sickness Unto Death is Despair 

 

Chapter  That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death 

 
The three forms of despair not being conscious of having a self not 
willing to be oneself but also despair at willing to be oneself Despair 
is sickness unto death 

 

Chapter  The Universality of This Sickness Despair 
 

A mans life is wasted when he lives on so deceived by the joys of life 
or by its sorrows that he never becomes decisively conscious of himself 
as spirit as self that is he never is aware in the deepest sense that 
there is a God 

 

Chapter  The Forms of This Sickness ie of Despair 

 
In every instant a self exists and is in the process of becoming The self 
does not actually exist but is only that which it is to become In so 

 



far as the self does not become itself it is not its own self and not to 
be ones own self is despair 

 

Part  Despair is Sin 

 

Chapter  Despair is Sin 

 
Sin means to be in despair at not willing to be oneself or to be in 
despair at willing to be oneself The lives of most men being 
determined by a dialectic of indifference are so remote from the good 
that is faith that they are almost too spiritless to be called sinners 
almost too spiritless to be called despairers 

 

Chapter  Continuation of Sin 

 
A definition of faith By relating itself to its own self and by willing to 
be itself the self is grounded transparently in the Power which 
constituted it This means we must not despair over despairing about 
our sins nor must we abandon faith and instead substitute 
indifference 

 



Preface  

 

To many the form of this exposition will perhaps seem strange it will 
seem to them too strict to be edifying and too edifying to be strictly 
scientific As to this latter point I have no opinion As to the first 
however this does not express my opinion of the matter and if it were 
true that the form is too strict to be edifying that according to my 
conception would be a fault It is one question whether it cannot be 
edifying to everyone seeing that not everyone possesses the capacity 
for following it it is another question whether it possesses the specific 
character of the edifying From the Christian point of view everything 
absolutely everything should serve for edification The sort of learning 
which is not in the last resort edifying is precisely for that reason 
unchristian Everything that is Christian must bear some resemblance to 
the address which a physician makes beside the sickbed although it 
can be fully understood only by one who is versed in medicine yet it 
must never be forgotten that it is pronounced beside the sickbed This 
relation of the Christian teaching to life in contrast with a scientific 
aloofness from life or this ethical side of Christianity is essentially the 
edifying and the form in which it is presented however strict it may 
be is altogether different qualitatively different from that sort of 
learning which is indifferent the lofty heroism of which is from a 
Christian point of view so far from being heroism that from a Christian 
point of view it is an inhuman sort of curiosity The Christian heroism 
and perhaps it is rarely to be seen is to venture wholly to be oneself 
as an individual man this definite individual man alone before the 
face of God alone in this tremendous exertion and this tremendous 

 



responsibility but it is not Christian heroism to be humbugged by the 
pure idea of humanity or to play the game of marveling at world
history All Christian knowledge however strict its form ought to be 
anxiously concerned but this concern is precisely the note of the 
edifying Concern implies relationship to life to the reality of personal 
existence and thus in a Christian sense it is seriousness the high 
aloofness of indifferent learning is from the Christian point of view 
far from being seriousness it is from the Christian point of view jest 
and vanity But seriousness again is the edifying 

This little book therefore is in one sense composed in a way that a 
seminary student could write it in another sense however in a way 
that perhaps not every professor could write it 

But the fact that the form in which this treatise is clothed is what it is 
is at least the result of due reflection and at all events it is certainly 
correct from a psychological point of view There is a more solemn 
style which is so solemn that it does not signify much and since one is 
too well accustomed to it it easily becomes entirely meaningless 

Only one remark more doubtless a superfluity but for that I am willing 
to assume the blame I would call attention once for all to the fact that 
in this whole book as the title indeed says despair is conceived as the 
sickness not as the cure So dialectical is despair So also in the 
Christian terminology death is the expression for the greatest spiritual 
wretchedness and yet the cure is simply to die to die from  

 

 



Introduction  

 

This sickness is not unto death John  and yet Lazarus died for 
when the disciples misunderstood the words which Christ adjoined 
later Lazarus our friend is asleep but I go to wake him out of his 
sleep  He said plainly Lazarus is dead  So then 
Lazarus is dead and yet this sickness was not unto death he was dead 
and yet this sickness is not unto death Now we know that Christ was 
thinking of the miracle which would permit the bystanders if they 
believed to see the glory of God  the miracle by which He 
awoke Lazarus from the dead so that this sickness was not only not 
unto death but as Christ had foretold for the glory of God that the 
Son of God might be glorified thereby  Oh but even if Christ 
had not awakened Lazarus from the dead is it not true that this 
sickness that death itself was not a sickness unto death When Christ 
comes to the grave and cries with a loud voice Lazarus come forth 
 it is evident enough that this sickness is not unto death But 
even if Christ had not said these words  merely the fact that He who 
is the resurrection and the life  comes to the grave is not this 
a sufficient sign that this sickness is not unto death does not the fact 
that Christ exists mean that this sickness is not unto death And what 
help would it have been to Lazarus to be awakened from the dead if 
the thing must end after all with his dying  how would that have 
helped Lazarus if He did not live who is the resurrection and the life 
for everyone who believes in Him No it is not because Lazarus was 
awakened from the dead not for this can one say that this sickness is 
not unto death but because He lives therefore this sickness is not 

 



unto death For humanly speaking death is the last thing of all and 
humanly speaking there is hope only so long as there is life But 
Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all hence 
it is only a little event within that which is all an eternal life and 
Christianly understood there is in death infinitely much more hope 
than merely humanly speaking there is when there not only is life but 
this life exhibits the fullest health and vigor 

So then in the Christian understanding of it not even death is the 
sickness unto death still less everything which is called earthly and 
temporal suffering want sickness wretchedness affliction adversities 
torments mental sufferings sorrow grief And even if such things are 
so painful and hard to bear that we men say or at all events the 
sufferer says This is worse than death  everything of the sort 
which if it is not a sickness is comparable to a sickness is 
nevertheless in the Christian understanding of it not the sickness unto 
death 

So it is that Christianity has taught the Christian to think dauntlessly of 
everything earthly and worldly including death It is almost as though 
the Christian must be puffed up because of this proud elevation above 
everything men commonly call misfortune above that which men 
commonly call the greatest evil But then in turn Christianity has 
discovered an evil which man as such does not know of this misery is 
the sickness unto death What the natural man considers horrible  
when he has in this wise enumerated everything and knows nothing 
more he can mention this for the Christian is like a jest Such is the 
relation between the natural man and the Christian it is like the 
relation between a child and a man what the child shudders at the 
man regards as nothing The child does not know what the dreadful is 

 



this the man knows and he shudders at it The childs imperfection 
consists first of all in not knowing what the dreadful is and then 
again as an implication of this in shuddering at that which is not 
dreadful And so it is also with the natural man he is ignorant of what 
the dreadful truly is yet he is not thereby exempted from shuddering 
no he shudders at that which is not the dreadful he does not know 
the true God but this is not the whole of it he worships an idol as 
God 

Only the Christian knows what is meant by the sickness unto death He 
acquires as a Christian a courage which the natural man does not know 
 this courage he acquires by learning fear for the still more dreadful 
Such is the way a man always acquires courage when one fears a 
greater danger it is as though the other did not exist But the dreadful 
thing the Christian learned to know is the sickness unto death 

 



Part  The Sickness Unto Death is Despair 

 

Chapter  That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death  

 

A Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit in the Self and So It May 
Assume a Triple Form in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having 
a Self Despair Improperly So Called in Despair at Not Willing to 
Be Oneself in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself 

Man is spirit But what is spirit Spirit is the self But what is the self 
The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self or it is that in 
the relation which accounts for it that the relation relates itself to its 
own self the self is not the relation but consists in the fact that the 
relation relates itself to its own self Man is a synthesis of the infinite 
and the finite of the temporal and the eternal of freedom and 
necessity in short it is a synthesis A synthesis is a relation between 
two factors So regarded man is not yet a self 

In the relation between two the relation is the third term as a negative 
unity and the two relate themselves to the relation and in the relation 
to the relation such a relation is that between soul and body when 
man is regarded as soul If on the contrary the relation relates itself to 
its own self the relation is then the positive third term and this is the 
self 

 



Such a relation which relates itself to its own self that is to say a self 
must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another 

If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by 
another the relation doubtless is the third term but this relation the 
third term is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted 
the whole relation 

Such a derived constituted relation is the human self a relation which 
relates itself to its own self and in relating itself to its own self relates 
itself to another Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair 
properly so called If the human self had constituted itself there could 
be a question only of one form that of not willing to be ones own 
self of willing to get rid of oneself but there would be no question of 
despairingly willing to be oneself This formula ie that the self is 
constituted by another is the expression for the total dependence of 
the relation the self namely the expression for the fact that the self 
cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself but 
only by relating itself to that Power which constituted the whole 
relation Indeed so far is it from being true that this second form of 
despair despair at willing to be ones own self denotes only a 
particular kind of despair that on the contrary all despair can in the 
last analysis be reduced to this If a man in despair is as he thinks 
conscious of his despair does not talk about it meaninglessly as of 
something which befell him pretty much as when a man who suffers 
from vertigo talks with nervous selfdeception about a weight upon his 
head or about its being like something falling upon him etc this 
weight and this pressure being in fact not something external but an 
inverse reflection from an inward experience and if by himself and by 
himself only he would abolish the despair then by all the labor he 

 



expends he is only laboring himself deeper into a deeper despair The 
disrelationship of despair is not a simple disrelationship but a 
disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to its own self and is 
constituted by another so that the disrelationship in that selfrelation 
reflects itself infinitely in the relation to the Power which constituted 
it 

This then is the formula which describes the condition of the self when 
despair is completely eradicated by relating itself to its own self and 
by willing to be itself the self is grounded transparently in the Power 
which posited it 

B Possibility and Actuality of Despair 

Is despair an advantage or a drawback Regarded in a purely dialectical 
way it is both If one were to stick to the abstract notion of despair 
without thinking of any concrete despairer one might say that it is an 
immense advantage The possibility of this sickness is mans advantage 
over the beast and this advantage distinguishes him far more 
essentially than the erect posture for it implies the infinite erectness or 
loftiness of being spirit The possibility of this sickness is mans 
advantage over the beast to be sharply observant of this sickness 
constitutes the Christians advantage over the natural man to be 
healed of this sickness is the Christians bliss 

So then it is an infinite advantage to be able to despair and yet it is 
not only the greatest misfortune and misery to be in despair no it is 
perdition Ordinarily there is no such relation between possibility and 
actuality if it is an advantage to be able to be this or that it is a still 
greater advantage to be such a thing That is to say being is related to 

 



the ability to be as an ascent In the case of despair on the contrary 
being is related to the ability to be as a fall Infinite as is the advantage 
of the possibility just so great is the measure of the fall So in the case 
of despair the ascent consists in not being in despair Yet this 
statement is open to misunderstanding The thing of not being in 
despair is not like not being lame blind etc In case the not being in 
despair means neither more nor less than not being this then it is 
precisely to be it The thing of not being in despair must mean the 
annihilation of the possibility of being this if it is to be true that a 
man is not in despair one must annihilate the possibility every instant 
Such is not ordinarily the relation between possibility and actuality 
Although thinkers say that actuality is the annihilated possibility yet 
this is not entirely true it is the fulfilled the effective possibility Here 
on the contrary the actuality not being in despair which in its very 
form is a negation is the impotent annihilated possibility ordinarily 
actuality in comparison with possibility is a confirmation here it is a 
negation 

Despair is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself 
But the synthesis is not the disrelationship it is merely the possibility 
or in the synthesis is latent the possibility of the disrelationship If the 
synthesis were the disrelationship there would be no such thing as 
despair for despair would then be something inherent in human nature 
as such that is it would not be despair it would be something that 
befell a man something he suffered passively like an illness into which 
a man falls or like death which is the lot of all No this thing of 
despairing is inherent in man himself but if he were not a synthesis he 
could not despair neither could he despair if the synthesis were not 
originally from Gods hand in the right relationship 

 



Whence then comes despair From the relation wherein the synthesis 
relates itself to itself in that God who made man a relationship lets 
this go as it were out of His hand that is in the fact that the relation 
relates itself to itself And herein in the fact that the relation is spirit is 
the self consists the responsibility under which all despair lies and so 
lies every instant it exists however much and however ingeniously the 
despairer deceiving himself and others may talk of his despair as a 
misfortune which has befallen him with a confusion of things 
different as in the case of vertigo aforementioned with which though 
it is qualitatively different despair has much in common since vertigo 
is under the rubric soul what despair is under the rubric spirit and is 
pregnant with analogies to despair 

So when the disrelationship  that is despair  has set in does it 
follow as a matter of course that it continues No it does not follow 
as a matter of course if the disrelationship continues it does not 
follow as a consequence of the disrelation but as a consequence of the 
relation which relates itself to itself That is to say every time the 
disrelation expresses itself and every instant it exists it is to the 
relation one must revert Observe that we speak of a man contracting a 
disease maybe through carelessness Then the illness sets in and from 
that instant it affirms itself and is now an actuality the origin of which 
recedes more and more into the past It would be cruel and inhuman if 
one were to continue to say incessantly This instant thou the sick 
man art contracting this disease that is if every instant one were to 
resolve the actuality of the disease into its possibility It is true that he 
did contract the disease but this he did only once the continuance of 
the disease is a simple consequence of the fact that he once contracted 
it its progress is not to be referred every instant to him as the cause 

 



he contracted it but one cannot say that he is contracting it Not so 
with despair every actual instant of despair is to be referred back to 
possibility every instant the man in despair is contracting it it is 
constantly in the present tense nothing comes to pass here as a 
consequence of a bygone actuality superseded at every actual instant 
of despair the despairer bears as his responsibility all the foregoing 
experience in possibility as a present This comes from the fact that 
despair is a qualification of spirit that it is related to the eternal in 
man But the eternal he cannot get rid of no not to all eternity he 
cannot cast it from him once for all nothing is more impossible every 
instant he does not possess it he must have cast it or be casting it from 
him  but it comes back every instant he is in despair he contracts 
despair For despair is not a result of the disrelationship but of the 
relation which relates itself to itself And the relation to himself a man 
cannot get rid of any more than he can get rid of himself which 
moreover is one and the same thing since the self is the relationship to 
oneself 

C Despair is The Sickness unto Death 

The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood however 
in a peculiar sense Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome 
of which is death Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as synonymous 
with a sickness unto death In this sense despair cannot be called the 
sickness unto death But in the Christian understanding of it death 
itself is a transition unto life In view of this there is from the Christian 
standpoint no earthly bodily sickness unto death For death is 
doubtless the last phase of the sickness but death is not the last thing 
If in the strictest sense we are to speak of a sickness unto death it 

 



must be one in which the last thing is death and death the last thing 
And this precisely is despair 

Yet in another and still more definite sense despair is the sickness unto 
death It is indeed very far from being true that literally understood 
one dies of this sickness or that this sickness ends with bodily death 
On the contrary the torment of despair is precisely this not to be able 
to die So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund 
when he lies and struggles with death and cannot die So to be sick 
unto death is not to be able to die  yet not as though there were 
hope of life no the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope 
death is not available When death is the greatest danger one hopes 
for life but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful 
danger one hopes for death So when the danger is so great that death 
has become ones hope despair is the disconsolateness of not being 
able to die 

It is in this last sense that despair is the sickness unto death this 
agonizing contradiction this sickness in the self everlastingly to die to 
die and yet not to die to die the death For dying means that it is all 
over but dying the death means to live to experience death and if for 
a single instant this experience is possible it is tantamount to 
experiencing it forever If one might die of despair as one dies of a 
sickness then the eternal in him the self must be capable of dying in 
the same sense that the body dies of sickness But this is an 
impossibility the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a 
living The despairing man cannot die no more than the dagger can 
slay thoughts can despair consume the eternal thing the self which is 
the ground of despair whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not 
quenched Yet despair is precisely selfconsuming but it is an impotent 

 



selfconsumption which is not able to do what it wills and this 
impotence is a new form of selfconsumption in which again 
however the despairer is not able to do what he wills namely to 
consume himself This is despair raised to a higher potency or it is the 
law for the potentiation This is the hot incitement or the cold fire in 
despair the gnawing canker whose movement is constantly inward 
deeper and deeper in impotent selfconsumption The fact that despair 
does not consume him is so far from being any comfort to the 
despairing man that it is precisely the opposite this comfort is precisely 
the torment it is precisely this that keeps the gnawing pain alive and 
keeps life in the pain This precisely is the reason why he despairs  
not to say despaired  because he cannot consume himself cannot get 
rid of himself cannot become nothing This is the potentiated formula 
for despair the rising of the fever in the sickness of the self  

A despairing man is in despair over something So it seems for an 
instant but only for an instant that same instant the true despair 
manifests itself or despair manifests itself in its true character For in 
the fact that he despaired of something he really despaired of himself 
and now would be rid of himself Thus when the ambitious man whose 
watchword was Either Caesar or nothing does not become Caesar he 
is in despair thereat But this signifies something else namely that 
precisely because he did not become Caesar he now cannot endure to 
be himself So properly he is not in despair over the fact that he did 
not become Caesar but he is in despair over himself for the fact that 
he did not become Caesar This self which had he become Caesar 
would have been to him a sheer delight though in another sense 
equally in despair this self is now absolutely intolerable to him In a 
profounder sense it is not the fact that he did not become Caesar 

 



which is intolerable to him but the self which did not become Caesar is 
the thing that is intolerable or more correctly what is intolerable to 
him is that he cannot get rid of himself If he had become Caesar he 
would have been rid of himself in desperation but now that he did not 
become Caesar he cannot in desperation get rid of himself Essentially 
he is equally in despair in either case for he does not possess himself 
he is not himself By becoming Caesar he would not after all have 
become himself but have got rid of himself and by not becoming 
Caesar he falls into despair over the fact that he cannot get rid of 
himself Hence it is a superficial view which presumably has never seen 
a person in despair not even ones own self when it is said of a man 
in despair He is consuming himself For precisely this it is he despairs 
of and to his torment it is precisely this he cannot do since by despair 
fire has entered into something that cannot burn or cannot burn up 
that is into the self 

So to despair over something is not yet properly despair It is the 
beginning or it is as when the physician says of a sickness that it has 
not yet declared itself The next step is the declared despair despair 
over oneself A young girl is in despair over love and so she despairs 
over her lover because he died or because he was unfaithful to her 
This is not a declared despair no she is in despair over herself This 
self of hers which if it had become his beloved she would have 
been rid of in the most blissful way or would have lost this self is now 
a torment to her when it has to be a self without him this self which 
would have been to her riches though in another sense equally in 
despair has now become to her a loathsome void since he is dead 
or it has become to her an abhorrence since it reminds her of the fact 
that she was betrayed Try it now say to such a girl Thou art 

 



consuming thyself and thou shalt hear her reply Oh no the torment 
is precisely this that I cannot do it 

To despair over oneself in despair to will to be rid of oneself is the 
formula for all despair and hence the second form of despair in 
despair at willing to be oneself can be followed back to the first in 
despair at not willing to be oneself just as in the foregoing we 
resolved the first into the second cf I A despairing man wants 
despairingly to be himself But if he despairingly wants to be himself 
he will not want to get rid of himself Yes so it seems but if one 
inspects more closely one perceives that after all the contradiction is 
the same That self which he despairingly wills to be is a self which he 
is not for to will to be that self which one truly is is indeed the 
opposite of despair what he really wills is to tear his self away from 
the Power which constituted it But notwithstanding all his despair 
this he is unable to do notwithstanding all the efforts of despair that 
Power is the stronger and it compels him to be the self he does not 
will to be But for all that he wills to be rid of himself to be rid of the 
self which he is in order to be the self he himself has chanced to 
chose To be self as he wills to be would be his delight though in 
another sense it would be equally in despair but to be compelled to 
be self as he does not will to be is his torment namely that he cannot 
get rid of himself 

Socrates proved the immortality of the soul from the fact that the 
sickness of the soul sin does not consume it as sickness of the body 
consumes the body So also we can demonstrate the eternal in man 
from the fact that despair cannot consume his self that this precisely is 
the torment of contradiction in despair If there were nothing eternal in 

 



a man he could not despair but if despair could consume his self 
there would still be no despair 

Thus it is that despair this sickness in the self is the sickness unto 
death The despairing man is mortally ill In an entirely different sense 
than can appropriately be said of any disease we may say that the 
sickness has attacked the noblest part and yet the man cannot die 
Death is not the last phase of the sickness but death is continually the 
last To be delivered from this sickness by death is an impossibility for 
the sickness and its torment    and death consist in not being able to 
die 

This is the situation in despair And however thoroughly it eludes the 
attention of the despairer and however thoroughly the despairer may 
succeed as in the case of that kind of despair which is characterized by 
unawareness of being in despair in losing himself entirely and losing 
himself in such a way that it is not noticed in the least  eternity 
nevertheless will make it manifest that his situation was despair and it 
will so nail him to himself that the torment nevertheless remains that 
he cannot get rid of himself and it becomes manifest that he was 
deluded in thinking that he succeeded And thus it is eternity must act 
because to have a self to be a self is the greatest concession made to 
man but at the same time it is eternitys demand upon him 

 



Chapter  The Universality of This Sickness Despair  

 

Just as the physician might say that there lives perhaps not one single 
man who is in perfect health so one might say perhaps that there lives 
not one single man who after all is not to some extent in despair in 
whose inmost parts there does not dwell a disquietude a perturbation 
a discord an anxious dread of an unknown something or of a 
something he does not even dare to make acquaintance with dread of 
a possibility of life or dread of himself so that after all as physicians 
speak of a man going about with a disease in him this man is going 
about and carrying a sickness of the spirit which only rarely and in 
glimpses by and with a dread which to him is inexplicable gives 
evidence of its presence within At any rate there has lived no one and 
there lives no one outside of Christendom who is not in despair and 
no one in Christendom unless he be a true Christian and if he is not 
quite that he is somewhat in despair after all 

This view will doubtless seem to many a paradox an exaggeration and 
a gloomy and depressing view at that Yet it is nothing of the sort It is 
not gloomy on the contrary it seeks to throw light upon a subject 
which ordinarily is left in obscurity It is not depressing on the 
contrary it is uplifting since it views every man in the aspect of the 
highest demand made upon him that he be spirit Nor is it a paradox 
on the contrary it is a fundamental apprehension consistently carried 
through and hence it is no exaggeration 

 



On the other hand the ordinary view of despair remains content with 
appearances and so it is a superficial view that is no view at all It 
assumes that every man must know by himself better than anyone else 
whether he is in despair or not So whoever says that he is in despair is 
regarded as being in despair but whoever thinks he is not in despair is 
not so regarded Consequently despair becomes a rather rare 
phenomenon whereas in fact it is quite universal It is not a rare 
exception that one is in despair no the rare the very rare exception is 
that one is not in despair 

But the vulgar view has a very poor understanding of despair Among 
other things to mention only one which if rightly understood would 
bring thousands yea millions under this category it completely 
overlooks the fact that one form of despair is precisely this of not 
being in despair that is not being aware of it The vulgar view is 
exposed though in a much deeper sense to the same fallacy it 
sometimes falls into when it would determine whether a man is sick or 
not In a much deeper sense I say for the vulgar view has a far more 
inadequate notion of spirit than of sickness and health  and without 
understanding spirit it is impossible to understand despair It is 
ordinarily assumed that a man is well when he does not himself say 
that he is sick and still more confidently when he says that he is well 
The physician on the other hand regards sickness differently And why 
Because he has a definite and well thought out conception of what it 
is to be in sound health and by this he tests the mans condition The 
physician knows that just as there is sickness which is only imaginary 
so also there is such a thing as fictitious health In the latter case 
therefore the physician first employs medicines to cause the disease to 
become manifest Generally the physician just because he is a 

 



physician ie the competent man has no unconditional faith in a 
persons own assertion about the state of his health If it were true that 
what every man says about the state of his health as to whether he is 
sick or well where he suffers etc were absolutely to be relied upon it 
would be an illusion to be a physician For a physician does not merely 
have to prescribe medicines but first and foremost he has to be 
acquainted with sickness and so first and foremost to know whether a 
supposedly sick man really is sick or whether a supposedly well man is 
not really sick So it is also with the physician of souls when dealing 
with despair He knows what despair is he is acquainted with it and 
hence he is not satisfied with a mans assertion that he is in despair or 
that he is not For it must be observed that in a certain sense not even 
all who say they are in despair always are so One may affect despair 
and one may make a mistake and confuse despair with all sorts of 
transitory dejection or grief which pass away without coming to the 
point of despair However the physician of souls does it is true regard 
these states also as forms of despair He perceives very well that this is 
affectation  but precisely this affectation is despair He perceives very 
well that this dejection etc does not mean much  but precisely this 
fact that it does not mean much is despair 

Furthermore the vulgar view overlooks the fact that as compared with 
sickness despair is much more dialectical than what is commonly called 
sickness because it is a sickness of the spirit And this dialectical 
quality rightly understood again brings thousands under the category 
of despair For in case at a given moment a physician is convinced that 
this or that person is in good health and at a later moment becomes 
sick  the physician may be right in affirming that the person was well 
then and at a later moment became sick With despair it is different 

 



As soon as despair manifests itself in a person it is manifest that the 
person was in despair For this reason one cannot at a given moment 
decide anything about a person who is not saved by the fact that he 
has been in despair For in case the condition comes about which 
brings him to despair it is at that same moment manifest that he has 
been in despair throughout the whole of his previous life On the other 
hand one is by no means justified in saying when a man has a fever 
that he has had a fever throughout his whole life But despair is a 
phenomenon of the spirit is related to the eternal and therefore has 
something of the eternal in its dialectic 

Not only is despair far more dialectical than an illness but all its 
symptoms are dialectical and for this reason the superficial view is so 
readily deceived in determining whether despair is present or not For 
not to be in despair may mean to be in despair and it may also mean 
to be delivered from being in despair A sense of security and 
tranquillity may mean that one is in despair precisely this security this 
tranquillity may be despair and it may mean that one has overcome 
despair and gained peace In this respect despair is unlike bodily 
sickness for not to be sick cannot possibly mean to be sick but not to 
be despairing may mean precisely to be despairing It is not true of 
despair as it is of bodily sickness that the feeling of indisposition is 
the sickness By no means The feeling of indisposition is again 
dialectical Never to have been sensible of this indisposition is precisely 
to be in despair 

This points to the fact and has its ground therein that man regarded 
as spirit is always in a critical condition  and if one is to talk of 
despair one must conceive of man as spirit In relation to sickness we 
talk of a crisis but not in relation to health And why not Because 

 



bodily health is an immediate qualification and only becomes 
dialectical in sickness when one can speak of the crisis But spiritually 
or when man is regarded as spirit both health and sickness are critical 
There is no such thing as immediate health of the spirit 

So long as one does not regard man as spirit in which case we cannot 
talk about despair but only as a synthesis of soul and body health is 
an immediate determinant and only the sickness of soul or body is a 
dialectical determinant But despair is expressed precisely by the fact 
that a person is unaware of being characterized as spirit Even that 
which humanly speaking is the most beautiful and lovable thing of 
all a feminine youthfulness which is sheer peace and harmony and joy 
 even that is despair For this indeed is happiness but happiness is 
not a characteristic of spirit and in the remote depths in the most 
inward parts in the hidden recesses of happiness there dwells also the 
anxious dread which is despair it would be only too glad to be allowed 
to remain therein for the dearest and most attractive dwellingplace of 
despair is in the very heart of immediate happiness All immediacy in 
spite of its illusory peace and tranquillity is dread and hence quite 
consistently it is dread of nothing one cannot make immediacy so 
anxious by the most horrifying description of the most dreadful 
something as by a crafty apparently casual half word about an 
unknown peril which is thrown out with the surely calculated aim of 
reflection yea one can put immediacy most in dread by slyly imputing 
to it knowledge of the matter referred to For immediacy doubtless 
does not know but never does reflection catch its prey so surely as 
when it makes its snare out of nothing and never is reflection so 
thoroughly itself as when it is    nothing There is need of an eminent 
reflection or rather of a great faith to support a reflection based upon 

 



nothing ie an infinite reflection So even the most beautiful and 
lovable thing of all a feminine youthfulness which is sheer peace and 
harmony and joy is nevertheless despair is happiness Hardly will one 
have the good hap to get through life on the strength of this 
immediacy And if this happiness has the hap to get through it would 
be of little help for it is despair Despair just because it is wholly 
dialectical is in fact the sickness of which it holds that it is the greatest 
misfortune not to have had it  the true good hap to get it although 
it is the most dangerous sickness of all if one does not wish to be 
healed of it In other cases one can only speak of the good fortune of 
being healed of a sickness sickness itself being misfortune 

Therefore it is as far as possible from being true that the vulgar view is 
right in assuming that despair is a rarity on the contrary it is quite 
universal It is as far as possible from being true that the vulgar view is 
right in assuming that everyone who does not think or feel that he is in 
despair is not so at all and that only he is in despair who says that he 
is On the contrary one who without affectation says that he is in 
despair is after all a little bit nearer a dialectical step nearer to being 
cured than all those who are not regarded and do not regard 
themselves as being in despair But precisely this is the common 
situation as the physician of souls will doubtless concede that the 
majority of men live without being thoroughly conscious that they are 
spiritual beings  and to this is referable all the security contentment 
with life etc etc which precisely is despair Those on the other hand 
who say that they are in despair are generally such as have a nature so 
much more profound that they must become conscious of themselves 
as spirit or such as by the hard vicissitudes of life and its dreadful 
decisions have been helped to become conscious of themselves as spirit 

 



 either one or the other for rare is the man who truly is free from 
despair 

Ah so much is said about human want and misery  I seek to 
understand it I have also had some acquaintance with it at close 
range so much is said about wasted lives  but only that mans life is 
wasted who lived on so deceived by the joys of life or by its sorrows 
that he never became eternally and decisively conscious of himself as 
spirit as self or what is the same thing never became aware and in 
the deepest sense received an impression of the fact that there is a 
God and that he he himself his self exists before this God which 
gain of infinity is never attained except through despair And oh this 
misery that so many live on and are defrauded of this most blessed of 
all thoughts this misery that people employ themselves about 
everything else or as for the masses of men that people employ them 
about everything else utilize them to generate the power for the 
theater of life but never remind them of their blessedness that they 
heap them in a mass and defraud them instead of splitting them apart 
so that they might gain the highest thing the only thing worth living 
for and enough to live in for an eternity  it seems to me that I could 
weep for an eternity over the fact that such misery exists And oh to 
my thinking this is one expression the more of the dreadfulness of this 
most dreadful sickness and misery namely its hiddenness  not only 
that he who suffers from it may wish to hide it and may be able to do 
so to the effect that it can so dwell in a man that no one no one 
whatever discovers it no rather that it can be so hidden in a man that 
he himself does not know it And oh when the hourglass has run 
out the hourglass of time when the noise of worldliness is silenced 
and the restless or the ineffectual busyness comes to an end when 

 



everything is still about thee as it is in eternity  whether thou wast 
man or woman rich or poor dependent or independent fortunate or 
unfortunate whether thou didst bear the splendor of the crown in a 
lofty station or didst bear only the labor and heat of the day in an 
inconspicuous lot whether thy name shall be remembered as long as 
the world stands and so was remembered as long as the world stood 
or without a name thou didst cohere as nameless with the countless 
multitude whether the glory which surrounded thee surpassed all 
human description or the judgment passed upon thee was the most 
severe and dishonoring human judgement can pass  eternity asks of 
thee and of every individual among these million millions only one 
question whether thou hast lived in despair or not whether thou wast 
in despair in such a way that thou didst not know thou wast in despair 
or in such a way that thou didst hiddenly carry this sickness in thine 
inward parts as thy gnawing secret carry it under thy heart as the fruit 
of a sinful love or in such a way that thou a horror to others didst 
rave in despair And if so if thou hast lived in despair whether for the 
rest thou didst win or lose then for thee all is lost eternity knows 
thee not it never knew thee or even more dreadful it knows thee as 
thou art known it puts thee under arrest by thyself in despair 

 



Chapter  The Forms of This Sickness ie of Despair  

 

The forms of despair must be discoverable abstractly by reflecting upon 
the factors which compose the self as a synthesis The self is composed 
of infinity and finiteness But the synthesis is a relationship and it is a 
relationship which though it is derived relates itself to itself which 
means freedom The self is freedom But freedom is the dialectical 
element in the terms possibility and necessity 

Principally however despair must be viewed under the category of 
consciousness the question whether despair is conscious or not 
determines the qualitative difference between despair and despair In 
its concept all despair is doubtless conscious but from this it does not 
follow that he in whom it exists he to whom it can rightly be 
attributed in conformity with the concept is himself conscious of it It 
is in this sense that consciousness is decisive Generally speaking 
consciousness ie consciousness of self is the decisive criterion of the 
self The more consciousness the more self the more consciousness 
the more will and the more will the more self A man who has no will 
at all is no self the more will he has the more consciousness of self he 
has also 

A Despair Regarded in Such a Way That One Does Not Reflect 
Whether It Is Conscious or Not So That One Reflects Only upon the 
Factors of the Synthesis 

a Despair viewed under the aspects of FinitudeInfinitude 

 



The self is the conscious synthesis of infinitude and finitude which 
relates itself to itself whose task is to become itself a task which can 
be performed only by means of a relationship to God But to become 
oneself is to become concrete But to become concrete means neither 
to become finite nor infinite for that which is to become concrete is a 
synthesis Accordingly the development consists in moving away from 
oneself infinitely by the process of infinitizing oneself and in returning 
to oneself infinitely by the process of finitizing If on the contrary the 
self does not become itself it is in despair whether it knows it or not 
However a self every instant it exists is in process of becoming for 
the self potentially does not actually exist it is only that which it is to 
become In so far as the self does not become itself it is not its own 
self but not to be ones own self is despair 

 The Despair Of Infinitude Is Due To The Lack Of Finitude 

The truth of this is inherent in the dialectical fact that the self is a 
synthesis of two factors the one of which is constantly the opposite 
of the other No kind of despair can be defined directly ie 
undialectically but only by reflecting upon the opposite factor The 
despairing persons condition of despair can be directly described as 
the poet does in fact by attributing to him the appropriate lines But to 
describe despair is possible only by its opposite and if the lines are to 
have poetic value they must contain in their coloring a reflection of 
the dialectical opposite So then every human existence which 
supposedly has become or merely wills to become infinite is despair 
For the self is a synthesis in which the finite is the limiting factor and 
the infinite is the expanding factor Infinitudes despair is therefore the 
fantastical the limitless The self is in sound health and free from 

 



despair only when precisely by having been in despair it is grounded 
transparently in God 

The fantastical is doubtless most closely related to fantasy 
imagination but imagination in turn is related to feeling knowledge 
and will so that a person may have a fantastic feeling or knowledge 
or will Generally speaking imagination is the medium of the process 
of infinitizing it is not one faculty on a par with others but if one 
would so speak it is the faculty instar omnium for all faculties What 
feeling knowledge or will a man has depends in the last resort upon 
what imagination he has that is to say upon how these things are 
reflected ie it depends upon imagination Imagination is the 
reflection of the process of infinitizing and hence the elder Fichte 
quite rightly assumed even in relation to knowledge that imagination 
is the origin of the categories The self is reflection and imagination is 
reflection it is the counterfeit presentment of the self which is the 
possibility of the self Imagination is the possibility of all reflection 
and the intensity of this medium is the possibility of the intensity of 
the self 

Generally the fantastical is that which so carries a man out into the 
infinite that it merely carries him away from himself and therewith 
prevents him from returning to himself 

So when feeling becomes fantastic the self is simply volatilized more 
and more at last becoming a sort of abstract sentimentality which is so 
inhuman that it does not apply to any person but inhumanly 
participates feelingly so to speak in the fate of one or another 
abstraction eg that of mankind in abstracto As the sufferer from 
rheumatism is unable to master his physical feelings which are under 

 



the sway of wind and weather with the result that he is involuntarily 
aware of a change in the air etc so it is with him whose feeling has 
become fantastic he becomes in a way infinitized but not in such a 
way that he becomes more and more himself for he loses himself more 
and more 

So it is with knowledge when it becomes fantastic The law for the 
development of the self with respect to knowledge in so far as it is 
true that the self becomes itself is this that the increasing degree of 
knowledge corresponds with the degree of selfknowledge that the 
more the self knows the more it knows itself If this does not occur 
then the more knowledge increases the more it becomes a kind of 
inhuman knowing for the production of which mans self is 
squandered pretty much as men were squandered for the building of 
the Pyramids or as men were squandered in the Russian hornbands to 
produce one note neither more nor less 

When the will becomes fantastic the self likewise is volatilized more 
and more In this case the will does not constantly become concrete in 
the same degree that it is abstract in such a way that the more it is 
infinitized in purpose and resolution the more present and 
contemporaneous with itself does it become in the small part of the 
task which can be realized at once so that in being infinitized it 
returns in the strictest sense to its self so that what is farthest from 
itself when it is most infinitized in purpose and resolution is in the 
same instant nearest to itself in accomplishing the infinitely small part 
of the task which can be done even today even at this hour even at 
this instant 

 



And when feeling or knowledge or will have thus become fantastic 
the entire self may at last become so whether in a more active form as 
when a man runs headlong into the fantastic or in a more passive 
form when he is carried away but in either case with moral 
responsibility The self thus leads a fantastic existence in abstract 
endeavor after infinity or in abstract isolation constantly lacking itself 
from which it merely gets further and further away So for example in 
the religious sphere The Godrelationship infinitizes but this may so 
carry a man away that it becomes an inebriation it may seem to a man 
as though it were unendurable to exist before God  for the reason 
that a man cannot return to himself cannot become himself Such a 
fantastic religious individual would say to characterize him by putting 
into his mouth these lines That a sparrow can live is comprehensible 
it does not know anything about existing before God But to know 
that one exists before God  and then not to go crazy or be brought 
to naught 

But in spite of the fact that a man has become fantastic in this 
fashion he may nevertheless although most commonly it becomes 
manifest be perfectly well able to live on to be a man as it seems to 
occupy himself with temporal things get married beget children win 
honor and esteem  and perhaps no one notices that in a deeper sense 
he lacks a self About such a thing as that not much fuss is made in 
the world for a self is the thing the world is least apt to inquire about 
and the thing of all things the most dangerous for a man to let people 
notice that he has it The greatest danger that of losing ones own 
self may pass off as quietly as if it were nothing every other loss that 
of an arm a leg five dollars a wife etc is sure to be noticed 

 The Despair of Finitude is Due to the Lack of Infinitude 

 



The truth of this as was shown under  is inherent in the dialectical 
fact that the self is a synthesis of two factors one of which is the 
opposite of the other 

The lack of infinitude means to be desperately narrowminded and 
meanspirited Here of course it is only a question of ethical meanness 
and narrowness The world really never talks of any narrowness but 
intellectual or aesthetic narrowness  or about the indifferent which is 
always the principal subject of the worlds talk for worldliness means 
precisely attributing infinite value to the indifferent The worldly view 
always clings fast to the difference between man and man and 
naturally it has no understanding of the one thing needful for to have 
that is spirituality and therefore no understanding of the narrowness 
and meanness of mind which is exemplified in having lost ones self  
not by evaporation in the infinite but by being entirely finitized by 
having become instead of a self a number just one man more one 
more repetition of this everlasting Einerlei 

Despairing narrowness consists in the lack of primitiveness or of the 
fact one has deprived oneself of ones primitiveness it consists in 
having emasculated oneself in a spiritual sense For every man is 
primitively planned to be a self appointed to become oneself and 
while it is true that every self as such is angular the logical 
consequence of this merely is that it has to be polished not that it has 
to be ground smooth not that for fear of men it has to give up 
entirely being itself nor even that for fear of men it dare not be itself 
in its essential accidentality which precisely is what should not be 
ground away by which in fine it is itself But while one sort of despair 
plunges wildly into the infinite and loses itself a second sort permits 
itself as it were to be defrauded by the others By seeing the 

 



multitude of men about it by getting engaged in all sorts of worldly 
affairs by becoming wise about how things go in this world such a 
man forgets himself forgets what his name is in the divine 
understanding of it does not dare to believe in himself finds it too 
venturesome a thing to be himself far easier and safer to be like the 
others to become an imitation a number a cipher in the crowd 

This form of despair is hardly ever noticed in the world Such a man 
precisely by losing his self in this way has gained perfectibility in 
adjusting himself to business yea in making a success in the world 
Here there is no hindrance no difficulty occasioned by his self and his 
infinitization he is ground smooth as a pebble courant as a wellused 
coin So far from being considered in despair he is just what a man 
ought to be In general the world has of course no understanding of 
what is truly dreadful The despair which not only occasions no 
embarrassment but makes ones life easy and comfortable is naturally 
not regarded as despair That this is the view of the world can also be 
seen in almost all the proverbs which are merely rules for shrewd 
behavior It is said for example that a man ten times regrets having 
spoken for the once he regrets his silence And why Because the fact 
of having spoken is an external fact which may involve one in 
annoyances since it is an actuality But the fact of having kept silent 
Yet this is the most dangerous thing of all For by keeping silent one is 
relegated solely to oneself no actuality comes to a mans aid by 
punishing him by bringing down upon him the consequences of his 
speech No in this respect to be silent is the easy way But he who 
knows what the dreadful is must for this very reason be most fearful 
of every fault of every sin which takes an inward direction and leaves 
no outward trace So it is too that in the eyes of the world it is 

 



dangerous to venture And why Because one may lose But not to 
venture is shrewd And yet by not venturing it is so dreadfully easy to 
lose that which it would be difficult to lose in even the most 
venturesome venture and in any case never so easily so completely as 
if it were nothing    ones self For if I have ventured amiss  very 
well then life helps me by its punishment But if I have not ventured 
at all  who then helps me And moreover if by not venturing at all 
in the highest sense and to venture in the highest sense is precisely to 
become conscious of oneself I have gained all earthly advantages    
and lose my self What of that 

And thus it is precisely with the despair of finitude In spite of the fact 
that a man is in despair he can perfectly well live on in the temporal in 
fact all the better for it he may be praised by men be honored and 
esteemed and pursue all the aims of temporal life What is called 
worldliness is made up of just such men who if one may use the 
expression pawn themselves to the world They use their talents 
accumulate money carry on worldly affairs calculate shrewdly etc 
etc are perhaps mentioned in history but themselves they are not 
spiritually understood they have no self no self for whose sake they 
could venture everything no self before God  however selfish they 
may be for all that 

b Despair Viewed Under the Aspects of PossibilityNecessity 

For the purpose of becoming and it is the task of the self freely to 
become itself possibility and necessity are equally essential Just as 
infinitude and finitude   The limitlessthe finite  important terms in 
Platos philosophy especially in his Philebus  both belong to the 

 



self so also do possibility and necessity A self which has no possibility 
is in despair and so in turn is the self which has no necessity 

 The Despair of Possibility is Due to the Lack Of Necessity 

The truth of this proposition as was shown is inherent in the 
dialectical situation 

Just as finitude is the limiting factor in relation to infinitude so in 
relation to possibility it is necessity which serves as a check When the 
self as a synthesis of finitude and infinitude is once constituted when 
already it is then in order to become it reflects itself in the medium of 
imagination and with that the infinite possibility comes into view The 
self is just as possible as it is necessary for though it is itself it has to 
become itself Inasmuch as it is itself it is the necessary and inasmuch 
as it has to become itself it is a possibility 

Now if possibility outruns necessity the self runs away from itself so 
that it has no necessity whereto it is bound to return  then this is the 
despair of possibility The self becomes an abstract possibility which 
tries itself out with floundering in the possible but does not budge 
from the spot nor get to any spot for precisely the necessary is the 
spot to become oneself is precisely a movement at the spot To 
become is a movement from the spot but to become oneself is a 
movement at the spot 

Possibility then appears to the self ever greater and greater more and 
more things become possible because nothing becomes actual At last 
it is as if everything were possible  but this is precisely when the 
abyss has swallowed up the self Every little possibility even would 

 



require some time to become actuality But finally the time which 
should be available for actuality becomes shorter and shorter 
everything becomes more and more instantaneous Possibility becomes 
more and more intense  but only in the sense of possibility not in 
the sense of actuality for in the sense of actuality the meaning of 
intensity is that at least something of that which is possible becomes 
actual At the instant something appears possible and then a new 
possibility makes its appearance at last this phantasmagoria moves so 
rapidly that it is as if everything were possible  and this is precisely 
the last moment when the individual becomes for himself a mirage 

What the self now lacks is surely reality  so one would commonly say 
as one says of a man that he has become unreal But upon closer 
inspection it is really necessity the man lacks For it is not true as the 
philosophers explain that necessity is a unity of possibility and 
actuality no actuality is a unity of possibility and necessity Nor is it 
merely due to lack of strength when the soul goes astray in possibility 
 at least this is not to be understood as people commonly understand 
it What really is lacking is the power to obey to submit to the 
necessary in oneself to what may be called ones limit Therefore the 
misfortune does not consist in the fact that such a self did not amount 
to anything in the world no the misfortune is that the man did not 
become aware of himself aware that the self he is is a perfectly 
definite something and so is the necessary On the contrary he lost 
himself owing to the fact that this self was seen fantastically reflected 
in the possible Even in looking at ones self in a minor it is requisite to 
know oneself for if not one does not behold ones self but merely a 
man But the mirror of possibility is not an ordinary mirror it must be 
used with the utmost precaution For of this minor it is true in the 

 



highest sense that it is a false mirror That the self looks so and so in 
the possibility of itself is only half truth for in the possibility of itself 
the self is still far from itself or only half itself So the question is how 
the necessity of the self determines it more precisely A case analogous 
to possibility is when a child is invited to participate in some pleasure 
or another the child is at once willing but now it is a question 
whether the parents will permit it  and as with the parents so it is 
with necessity 

In possibility however everything is possible Hence in possibility one 
can go astray in all possible ways but essentially in two One form is 
the wishful yearning form the other is the melancholy fantastic  on 
the one hand hope on the other fear or anguished dread Fairytales 
and legends so often relate that a knight suddenly perceived a rare 
bird which he continues to run after since at the beginning it seemed 
as if it were so very near  but then it flies off again until at last 
night falls and he has become separated from his companions being 
unable to find his way in the wilderness where he now is So it is with 
the possibility of the wish Instead of summoning back possibility into 
necessity the man pursues the possibility  and at last he cannot find 
his way back to himself  In the melancholy form the opposite result 
is reached in the same way The individual pursues with melancholy 
love a possibility of agonizing dread which at last leads him away from 
himself so that he perishes in the dread or perishes in that in which he 
was in dread of perishing 

 The Despair of Necessity is Due to the Lack of Possibility 

If one will compare the tendency to run wild in possibility with the 
efforts of a child to enunciate words the lack of possibility is like being 

 



dumb Necessity is like a sequence of consonants only but in order to 
utter them there must in addition be possibility When this is lacking 
when a human existence is brought to the pass that it lacks possibility 
it is in despair and every instant it lacks possibility it is in despair 

One commonly thinks that there is a certain age which is especially rich 
in hope or one talks about being or having been at a certain period or 
a particular moment of ones Life so rich in hope and possibility All 
this is merely human talk which never reaches the truth All this 
hoping and all this despairing is not yet the true hope and the true 
despair 

The decisive thing is that for God all things are possible This is 
eternally true and true therefore every instant This is commonly 
enough recognized in a way and in a way it is commonly affirmed 
but the decisive affirmation comes only when a man is brought to the 
utmost extremity so that humanly speaking no possibility exists Then 
the question is whether he will believe that for God all things are 
possible  that is to say whether he will believe But this is completely 
the formula for losing ones mind or understanding to believe is 
precisely to lose ones understanding in order to win God Suppose it 
occurs as follows Picture a man who with all the shuddering revolt of 
a terrified imagination has represented to himself some horror as a 
thing absolutely not to be endured Now it befalls him precisely this 
horror befalls him Humanly speaking his destruction is the most 
certain of all things  and the despair in his soul fights desperately to 
get leave to despair to get if you will repose for despair the consent 
of his whole personality to despair so that he would curse nothing and 
nobody more fiercely than him who attempted Or it may be the 

 



attempt to prevent him from despairing as the poets poet so 
capitally so incomparably expresses it in Richard II Act  Scene Z 

Beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth 
Of that sweet way I was in to despair 

So then salvation is humanly speaking the most impossible thing of 
all but for God all things are possible This is the fight of faith which 
fights madly if one would so express it for possibility For possibility is 
the only power to save When one swoons people shout for water Eau
deCologne Hoffmans Drops but when one is about to despair the 
cry is Procure me possibility procure possibility Possibility is the only 
saving remedy given a possibility and with that the desperate man 
breathes once more he revives again for without possibility a man 
cannot as if were draw breath Sometimes the inventiveness of a 
human imagination suffices to procure possibility but in the last 
resort that is when the point is to believe the only help is this that 
for God all things are possible 

Thus is the fight carried on Whether he who is engaged in this fight 
will be defeated depends solely and alone upon whether he has the 
will to procure for himself possibility that is to say whether he will 
believe And yet he understands that humanly speaking his destruction 
is the most certain thing of all This is the dialectical character of faith 
For the most part a man knows no more than that this or that as he 
has reason to hope as seems probable etc will not befall him If it 
befalls him then he succumbs The foolhardy man plunges into a 
danger involving this or that possibility if it befalls him he despairs 
and succumbs The believer perceives and understands humanly 
speaking his destruction in what has befallen him and in what he has 

 



ventured but he believes Therefore he does not succumb He leaves it 
wholly to God how he is to be helped but he believes that for God all 
things are possible To believe in his own destruction is impossible To 
understand that humanly it is his own destruction and then 
nevertheless to believe in the possibility is what is meant by faith So 
then God helps him  perhaps by letting him escape the terror 
perhaps by means of the terror  in the fact that here unexpectedly 
miraculously divinely help appears Miraculously  for it is a strange 
pedantry to assume that only eighteen hundred years ago it could 
occur that a man was helped miraculously Whether a man has been 
helped by a miracle depends essentially upon the degree of intellectual 
passion he has employed to understand that help was impossible and 
next upon how honest he is toward the Power which helped him 
nevertheless But usually it is neither the one thing nor the other men 
cry that there is no help without having strained the understanding to 
find help and afterwards they lie ungratefully 

The believer possesses the eternally certain antidote to despair viz 
possibility for with God all things are possible every instant This is the 
sound health of faith which resolves contradictions The contradiction 
in this case is that humanly speaking destruction is certain and that 
nevertheless there is possibility Health consists essentially in being able 
to resolve contradictions So it is bodily or physically a draft is 
indifferently cold and warm disparate qualities undialectically 
combined but a healthy body resolves this contradiction and does not 
notice the draft So it is also with faith 

The loss of possibility signifies either that everything has become 
necessary to a manor that everything has become trivial 

 



The determinist or the fatalist is in despair and in despair he has lost 
his self because for him everything is necessary He is like that king 
who died of hunger because all his food was transformed into gold 
Personality is a synthesis of possibility and necessity The condition of 
its survival is therefore analogous to breathing respiration which is an 
in and an aspiration The self of the determinist cannot breathe for 
it is impossible to breathe necessity alone which taken pure and simple 
suffocates the human self 

The fatalist is in despair  he has lost God and therefore himself as 
well for if he has no God neither has he a self But the fatalist has no 
God  or what is the same thing his god is necessity Inasmuch as for 
God all things are possible it may be said that this is what God is viz 
one for whom all things are possible The worship of the fatalist is 
therefore at its maximum an exclamation and essentially it is 
dumbness dumb submission he is unable to pray So to pray is to 
breathe and possibility is for the self what oxygen is for breathing But 
for possibility alone or for necessity alone to supply the conditions for 
the breathing of prayer is no more possible than it is for a man to 
breathe oxygen alone or nitrogen alone For in order to pray there 
must be a God there must be a self plus possibility or a self and 
possibility in the pregnant sense for God is that all things are possible 
and that all things are possible is God and only the man whose being 
has been so shaken that he became spirit by understanding that all 
things are possible only he has had dealings with God The fact that 
Gods will is the possible makes it possible for me to pray if Gods will 
is only the necessary man is essentially as speechless as the brutes 

In the case of philistinism or triviality which also lacks possibility the 
situation is somewhat different Philistinism is spiritlessness in the 

 



literal sense of the word determinism and fatalism are spiritual despair 
but such spiritlessness is also despair Philistinism lacks every 
determinant of spirit and terminates in probability within which the 
possible finds its insignificant place Thus it lacks sufficient possibility 
to take notice of God Devoid of imagination as the Philistine always 
is he lives in a certain trivial province of experience as to how things 
go what is possible what usually occurs Thus the Philistine has lost 
his self and God For in order to be aware of oneself and God 
imagination must enable a man to soar higher than the misty precinct 
of the probable it must wrench one out of this and by making 
possible that which transcends the quantum satis of every experience 
it must teach him to hope and fear or to fear and hope But 
imagination the Philistine does not possess he does not want to have 
it he abhors it So here there is no help And if sometimes reality helps 
by tenors which transcend the parrotwisdom of trivial experience then 
philistinism despairs  that is it becomes manifest that it was in 
despair It lacks the possibility of faith in order by Gods help to be able 
to deliver itself from certain destruction 

Fatalism and determinism however have enough imagination to 
despair of possibility and have possibility enough to discover 
impossibility Philistinism tranquilizes itself in the trivial being equally 
in despair whether things go well or ill Fatalism or determinism lacks 
the possibility of relaxing and soothing of tempering necessity and so 
it lacks possibility as assuagement Philistinism lacks possibility as 
revival from spiritlessness For philistinism thinks it is in control of 
possibility it thinks that when it has decoyed this prodigious elasticity 
into the field of probability or into the madhouse it holds it a 
prisoner it carries possibility around like a prisoner in the cage of the 

 



probable shows it off imagines itself to be the master does not take 
note that precisely thereby it has taken itself captive to be the slave of 
spiritlessness and to be the most pitiful of all things For with the 
audacity of despair that man soared aloft who ran wild in possibility 
but crushed down by despair that man strains himself against existence 
to whom everything has become necessary But philistinism spiritlessly 
celebrates its triumph 

B Despair Viewed Under the Aspect of Consciousness 

With every increase in the degree of consciousness and in proportion 
to that increase the intensity of despair increases the more 
consciousness the more intense the despair This is everywhere to be 
seen most clearly in the maximum and minimum of despair The 
devils despair is the most intense despair for the devil is sheer spirit 
and therefore absolute consciousness and transparency in the devil 
there is no obscurity which might serve as a mitigating excuse his 
despair is therefore absolute defiance This is the maximum of despair 
The minimum of despair is a state which as one might humanly be 
tempted to express it by reason of a sort of innocence does not even 
know that there is such a thing as despair So when consciousness is at 
its minimum the despair is least it is almost as if it were a dialectical 
problem whether one is justified in calling such a state despair 

a The Despair which is Unconscious that it is Despair or the 

Despairing Unconsciousness of having a Self and an Eternal Self 

That this condition is nevertheless despair and is rightly so 
denominated may be taken as an expression for a trait which we may 
call in a good sense the opinionativeness of truth Veritas est index 

 



sui et falsi But this opinionativeness of truth is to be sure held in 
scant honor as also it is far from being the case that men in general 
regard relationship to the truth the fact of standing in relationship to 
the truth as the highest good and it is very far from being the case 
that they Socratically regard being under a delusion as the greatest 
misfortune their sensuous nature is generally predominant over their 
intellectuality So when a man is supposed to be happy he imagines 
that he is happy whereas viewed in the light of the truth he is 
unhappy and in this case he is generally very far from wishing to be 
torn away from that delusion On the contrary he becomes furious he 
regards the man who does this as his most spiteful enemy he considers 
it an insult something near to murder in the sense that one speaks of 
killing joy What is the reason of this The reason is that the sensuous 
nature and the psychosensuous completely dominate him the reason 
is that he lives in the sensuous categories agreeabledisagreeable and 
says goodbye to truth etc the reason is that he is too sensuous to 
have the courage to venture to be spirit or to endure it However vain 
and conceited men may be they have nevertheless for the most part a 
very lowly conception of themselves that is to say they have no 
conception of being spirit the absolute of all that a man can be  but 
vain and conceited they are    by way of comparison In case one 
were to think of a house consisting of cellar groundfloor and premier 
tage so tenanted or rather so arranged that it was planned for a 
distinction of rank between the dwellers on the several floors and in 
case one were to make a comparison between such a house and what it 
is to be a man  then unfortunately this is the sorry and ludicrous 
condition of the majority of men that in their own house they prefer 
to live in the cellar The soulishbodily synthesis in every man is 
planned with a view to being spirit such is the building but the man 

 



prefers to dwell in the cellar that is in the determinants of 
sensuousness And not only does he prefer to dwell in the cellar no he 
loves that to such a degree that he becomes furious if anyone would 
propose to him to occupy the bel tage which stands empty at his 
disposition  for in fact he is dwelling in his own house 

No to be in error or delusion is quite unSocratically the thing they 
fear the least One may behold amazing examples which illustrate this 
fact on a prodigious scale A thinker erects an immense building a 
system a system which embraces the whole of existence and world
history etc  and if we contemplate his personal life we discover to 
our astonishment this terrible and ludicrous fact that he himself 
personally does not live in this immense highvaulted palace but in a 
barn alongside of it or in a dog kennel or at the most in the porters 
lodge If one were to take the liberty of calling his attention to this by 
a single word he would be offended For he has no fear of being under 
a delusion if only he can get the system completed    by means of 
the delusion 

So then the fact that the man in despair is unaware that his condition 
is despair has nothing to do with the case he is in despair all the 
same If despair is bewilderment Forvildelse then the fact that one is 
unconscious of it is the additional aggravation of being at the same 
time under a delusion Vildfarelse Unconsciousness of despair is like 
unconsciousness of dread cf The Concept of Dread by Vigilius 
Haufniensis the dread characteristic of spiritlessness is recognizable 
precisely by the spiritless sense of security but nevertheless dread is at 
the bottom of it and when the enchantment of illusion is broken 
when existence begins to totter then too does despair manifest itself 
as that which was at the bottom 

 



The despairing man who is unconscious of being in despair is in 
comparison with him who is conscious of it merely a negative step 
further from the truth and from salvation Despair itself is a negativity 
unconsciousness of it is a new negativity But to reach truth one must 
pierce through every negativity For here applies what the fairytale 
recounts about a certain enchantment the piece of music must be 
played through backwards otherwise the enchantment is not broken 
However it is only in one sense in a purely dialectical sense that he 
who is unconscious of despair is further away from truth and salvation 
than the man who is conscious of his despair and yet remains in it For 
in another sense an ethicaldialectic sense the despairing man who 
consciously remains in despair is further from salvation since his 
despair is more intense But unawareness is so far from removing 
despair or of transforming despair into nondespair that on the 
contrary it may be the most dangerous form of despair By 
unconsciousness the despairing man is in a way secured but to his 
own destruction against becoming aware  that is he is securely in 
the power of despair 

In unconsciousness of being in despair a man is furthest from being 
conscious of himself as spirit But precisely the thing of not being 
conscious of oneself as spirit is despair which is spiritlessness  
whether the condition be that of complete deadness a merely 
vegetative life or a life of higher potency the secret of which is 
nevertheless despair In the latter instance the man is like the sufferer 
from consumption he feels well considers himself in the best of 
health seems perhaps to others to be in florid health precisely when 
the sickness is most dangerous 

 



This form of despair ie unconsciousness of it is the commonest in 
the world  yes in what people call the world or to define it more 
exactly what Christianity calls the world ie paganism and the 
natural man in Christendom Paganism as it historically was and is and 
paganism within Christendom is precisely this sort of despair it is 
despair but does not know it It is true that a distinction is made also 
in paganism as well as by the natural man between being in despair 
and not being in despair that is to say people talk of despair as if only 
certain particular individuals were in despair But this distinction is just 
as deceitful as that which paganism and the natural man make 
between love and selflove as though all this love were not essentially 
selflove Further however than this deceitful distinction it was 
impossible for paganism including the natural man to go for the 
specific character of despair is precisely this it is unconscious of being 
despair 

From this we can easily perceive that the aesthetic concept of 
spiritlessness by no means furnishes the scale for judging what is 
despair and what is not  which moreover is a matter of course for 
since it is unable to define what spirit truly is how could the 
aesthetical make answer to a question which does not exist for it at 
all It would also be a prodigious stupidity to deny that pagan nations 
en masse as well as individual pagans have performed amazing 
exploits which have prompted and will prompt the enthusiasm of 
poets to deny that paganism exhibits examples of achievement which 
aesthetically cannot be sufficiently admired It would also be foolish to 
deny that in paganism lives have been led which were rich in aesthetic 
enjoyment and that the natural man can lead such a life utilizing 
every advantage offered with the most perfect good taste even letting 

 



art and learning enhance embellish ennoble the enjoyment No it is 
not the aesthetic definition of spiritlessness which furnishes the scale 
for judging what is despair and what is not the definition which must 
be used is the ethicoreligious either spiritor the negative lack of 
spirit spiritlessness Every human existence which is not conscious of 
itself as spirit or conscious of itself before God as spirit every human 
existence which is not thus grounded transparently in God but 
obscurely reposes or terminates in some abstract universality state 
nation etc or in obscurity about itself takes its faculties merely as 
active powers without in a deeper sense being conscious whence it has 
them which regards itself as an inexplicable something which is to be 
understood from without  every such existence whatever it 
accomplishes though it be the most amazing exploit whatever it 
explains though it were the whole of existence however intensely it 
enjoys life aesthetically  every such existence is after all despair It 
was this the old theologians meant when they talked about the virtues 
of the pagans being splendid vices They meant that the most inward 
experience of the pagan was despair that the pagan was not conscious 
of himself before God as spirit Hence it came about to cite here an 
example which has at the same time a deeper relation to the whole 
study that the pagans judged selfslaughter so lightly yea even 
praised it notwithstanding that for the spirit it is the most decisive sin 
that to break out of existence in this way is rebellion against God The 
pagan lacked the spirits definition of the self therefore he expressed 
such a judgment of selfslaughter  and this the same pagan did who 
condemned with moral severity theft unchastity etc He lacked the 
point of view for regarding selfslaughter he lacked the God
relationship and the self From a purely pagan point of view self
slaughter is a thing indifferent a thing every man may do if he likes 

 



because it concerns nobody else If from a pagan point of view one 
were to warn against selfslaughter it must be by a long detour by 
showing that it was breach of duty toward ones fellowmen The point 
in selfslaughter that it is a crime against God entirely escapes the 
pagan One cannot say therefore that the selfslaughter was despair 
which would be a thoughtless hysteron proteron one must say that the 
fact that the pagan judged selfslaughter as he did was despair 

Nevertheless there is and remains a distinction and a qualitative one 
between paganism in the narrowest sense and paganism within 
Christendom The distinction as Vigilius Haufniensis has pointed out in 
relation to dread is this that paganism though to be sure it lacks 
spirit is definitely oriented in the direction of spirit whereas paganism 
within Christendom lacks spirit with a direction away from it or by 
apostasy and hence in the strictest sense is spiritlessness 

b The Despair which is Conscious of being Despair as also it 

is Conscious of being a Self wherein there is after all something 
Eternal and then is either in despair at not willing to be itself or in 
despair at willing to be itself 

A distinction of course must be made as to whether he who is 
conscious of his despair has the true conception of what despair is 
Thus a man may be right according to the conception he has in 
asserting that he is in despair it may be true that he is in despair and 
yet this is not to say that he has the true conception of despair it may 
be that one who contemplated this mans life in the light of the true 
conception would say You are far more in despair than you are aware 
the despair lies far deeper So with the pagan to recall the foregoing 
instance when in comparison with others he considered himself in 

 



despair he doubtless was right in thinking that he was in despair but 
he was wrong in thinking that the others were not that is to say he 
had not the true conception of despair 

So then for conscious despair there is requisite on the one hand the 
true conception of what despair is On the other hand clearness is 
requisite about oneself  in so far that is to say as clearness and 
despair are compatible How far complete clarity about oneself as to 
whether one is in despair may be united with being in despair where 
this knowledge and selfknowledge might not avail precisely to tear a 
man out of his despair to make him so terrified about himself that he 
would cease to be in despair  these questions we shall not decide 
here we shall not even attempt to do so since in the sequel we shall 
find a place for this whole investigation But without pursuing the 
thought to this extremest point we here merely call attention to the 
fact that although the degree of consciousness as to what despair is 
may be very various so also may be the degree of consciousness 
touching ones own condition the consciousness that it is despair Real 
life is far too multifarious to be portrayed by merely exhibiting such 
abstract contrasts as that between a despair which is completely 
unconscious and one which is completely conscious of being such 
Most frequently no doubt the condition of the despairing man 
though characterized by multiform nuances is that of a half obscurity 
about his own condition He himself knows well enough in a way up to 
a certain point that he is in despair he notices it in himself as one 
notices in oneself that one is going about with an illness as yet 
unpronounced but he will not quite admit what illness it is At one 
moment it has almost become clear to him that he is in despair but 
then at another moment it appears to him after all as though his 

 



indisposition might have another ground as though it were the 
consequence of something external something outside himself and 
that if this were to be changed he would not be in despair Or perhaps 
by diversions or in other ways eg by work and busy occupations as 
means of distraction he seeks by his own effort to preserve an 
obscurity about his condition yet again in such a way that it does not 
become quite clear to him that he does it for this reason that he does 
what he does in order to bring about obscurity Or perhaps he even is 
conscious that he labors thus in order to sink the soul into obscurity 
does this with a certain acuteness and shrew calculation with 
psychological insight but is not in a deeper sense clearly conscious of 
what he does of how despairingly he labors etc For in fact there is in 
all obscurity a dialectical interplay of knowledge and will and in 
interpreting a man one may err either by emphasizing knowledge 
merely or merely the will 

But as was pointed out above the degree of consciousness potentiates 
despair In the same degree that a man has a truer conception of 
despair while still remaining in it and in the same degree that he is 
more conscious of being in despair in that same degree is his despair 
more intense He who with the consciousness that suicide is despair 
and to that extent with the true conception of what despair is then 
Commits suicide  that man has a more intense despair than the man 
who commits suicide without having the true conception that suicide is 
despair but conversely the less true his conception of suicide is the 
less intense his despair On the other hand the clearer consciousness of 
himself selfconsciousness a man has in committing suicide the more 
intense is his despair in comparison with that of the man whose soul 
compared with his is in a confused and obscure condition 

 



In what follows I shall go on to examine the two forms of conscious 
despair in such a way as to display at the same time a heightening of 
the consciousness of what despair is and of the consciousness of the 
fact that ones own condition is despair  or what is the same thing 
and the decisive thing a heightening of the consciousness of the self 
But the opposite of being in despair is believing hence we may 
perceive the justification for what was stated above IA as the formula 
which describes a condition in which no despair at all exists for this 
same formula is also the formula for believing by relating itself to its 
own self and by willing to be itself the self is grounded transparently 
in the Power which constituted it 

 In Despair at not Willing to be Oneself the Despair of 
Weakness 

When this form of despair is called the despair of weakness there is 
already contained in this a reflection upon the second form  the 
despair of willing despairingly to be oneself  defiance So the 
contrast here is only relative No despair is entirely without defiance in 
fact defiance is implied in the very expression Not to will to be On 
the other hand even the extremest defiance of despair is after all never 
without some weakness The difference is therefore only relative The 
one form is so to speak the despair of womanliness the other of 
manliness 

If psychologically one will take a look around in real life 
one will from time to time have opportunity to convince 
oneself that this distinction which is logically correct and 
so shall and must be pertinent is in fact pertinent and 
that this classification embraces the whole reality of 

 



despair For so far as the child is concerned one does not 
talk about despair but only about illtemper because one 
has only a right to assume that the eternal is present in 
the child  and has never a right to demand it of the child 
as one has a right to demand it of the grown man to 
whom it applies that he shall have it However I do not by 
any means wish to deny that on the part of women there 
may occur forms of manly despair and conversely forms 
of womanly despair on the part of men But these are 
exceptions And this is a matter of course the ideal also is 
rare and only in a purely ideal sense is this distinction 
between manly and womanly despair entirely true Woman 
has neither the selfishly developed conception of the self 
nor the intellectuality of man for all that she is his 
superior in tenderness and fineness of feeling On the 
other hand woman s nature is devotion Hengivenhed 
submission Hengivelse and it is unwomanly if it is not 
so Strangely enough no one can be so pert a word which 
language has expressly coined for woman so almost 
cruelly particular as a woman  and yet her nature is 
devotion and yet here is the marvel all this is really the 
expression for the fact that her nature is devotion For just 
because in her nature she carries the whole womanly 
devotion nature has lovingly equipped her with an 
instinct in comparison with which in point of delicacy the 
most eminently developed male reflection is as nothing 
This devotion of woman this to speak as a Greek divine 
dowry and riches is too great a good to be thrown away 
blindly and yet no clearsighted manly reflection is 

 



capable of seeing sharply enough to be able to dispose of 
it rightly Hence nature has taken care of her instinctively 
she sees blindly with greater clarity than the most sharp
sighted reflection instinctively she sees where it is she is 
to admire what it is she ought to devote herself to 
Devotion is the only thing woman has therefore nature 
undertook to be her guardian Hence it is too that 
womanliness first comes into existence through a 
metamorphosis it comes into existence when the infinite 
pertness is transfigured in womanly devotion But the fact 
that devotion is womans nature comes again to evidence 
in despair By devotion Ithe word literally means giving 
away she has lost herself and only thus is she happy only 
thus is she herself a woman who is happy without 
devotion that is without giving herself away to whatever 
it may be she gives herself is unwomanly A man also 
devotes himself gives himself away and it is a poor sort 
of a man who does not do it but his self is not devotion 
this is the expression for womanly substantial devotion 
nor does he acquire himself by devotion as in another 
sense a woman does he has himself he gives himself 
away hut his self still remains behind as a sober 
consciousness of devotion whereas woman with genuine 
womanliness plunges her self into that to which she 
devotes herself   In such a way man does not devote 
himself but the second form of despair expressed also the 
manly nature in despair at willing to be oneself 

 



So far with respect to the relation between the manly and 
the womanly despair It mnst be remembered however 
that we are not speaking here of devotion to God or of the 
Codrelationship which is not to be dealt with till we 
come to Part Second In the relationship to God where 
such a distinction as manwoman vanishes it is true of 
man as of woman that devotion is the self and that by 
devotion the self is acquired This is true equally for man 
and woman although most frequently in real life woman 
is related to God only through man 

i Despair Over the Earthly or Over Something Earthly 

This is pure immediacy or else an immediacy which contains a 
quantitative reflection  Here there is no infinite consciousness of the 
self of what despair is or of the fact that the condition is one of 
despair the despair is passive succumbing to the pressure of the 
outward circumstance it by no means comes from within as action It 
is if I may say so by an innocent misuse of language a play upon 
words as when children play at being soldiers that in the language of 
immediacy such words as the self and despair occur 

The immediate man in so far as immediacy is to be found without any 
reflection is merely soulishly determined his self or he himself is a 
something included along with the other in the compass of the 
temporal and the worldly and it has only an illusory appearance of 
possessing in it something eternal Thus the self coheres immediately 
with the other wishing desiring enjoying etc but passively even in 
desiring the self is in the dative case like the child when it says me 

 



for I Its dialectic is the agreeable and the disagreeable its concepts 
are good fortune misfortune fate 

Now then there happens befalls falls upon this immediate self 
something which brings it to despair in no other way can this come 
about since the self has no reflection in itself that which brings it to 
despair must come from without and the despair is merely passive 
That wherein immediacy has its being or supposing that after all it 
has a little bit of reflection in itself that part thereof to which it 
especially clings a man is deprived of by a stroke of fate in short he 
becomes as he calls it unfortunate that is the immediacy in him 
receives such a shock that it cannot recover itself  he despairs Or to 
mention a case which is more rarely to be seen in real life but which 
dialectically is entirely correct this despair of immediacy occurs 
through what the immediate man calls an alltoogreat good fortune 
for it is a fact that immediacy as such is prodigiously fragile and every 
quid nimis excess which demands of it reflection brings it to despair 

So then he despairs that is to say by a strangely preposterous attitude 
and a complete mystification with regard to himself he calls this 
despair But to despair is to lose the eternal  and of this he does not 
speak does not dream The loss of the earthly as such is not the cause 
of despair and yet it is of this he speaks and he calls it despairing 
What he says is in a certain sense true only it is not true in the sense 
in which he understands it he stands with his face inverted and what 
he says must be understood inversely he stands and points at that 
which is not a cause of despair and he declares that he is in despair 
and nevertheless it is quite true that despair is going on behind him 
without his knowing it It is as if one were to stand with ones back 
toward the City Hall and the Court House and pointing straight before 

 



him were to say There is the City Hall and the Court House The man 
is right there it is    if he turns around It is not true he is not in 
despair and yet he is right when he says it But he calls himself in 
despair he regards himself as dead as a shadow of himself But dead 
he is not there is if you will life in the characterization In case 
everything suddenly changes everything in the outward circumstances 
and the wish is fulfilled then life enters into him again immediacy 
rises again and he begins to live as fit as a fiddle But this is the only 
way immediacy knows how to fight the one thing it knows how to do 
to despair and swoon  and yet it knows what despair is less than 
anything else It despairs and swoons and thereupon it lies quite still 
as if it were dead like the childish play of lying dead immediacy is 
like certain lower animals which have no other weapon or means of 
defense but to lie quite still and pretend they are dead 

Meanwhile time passes If outward help comes then life returns to the 
despairer he begins where he left off he had no self and a self he did 
not become but he continues to live on with only the quality of 
immediacy If outward help does not come then in real life something 
else commonly occurs Life comes back into him after all but he never 
will be himself again so he says He now acquires some little 
understanding of life he learns to imitate the other men noting how 
they manage to live and so he too lives after a sort In Christendom he 
too is a Christian goes to church every Sunday hears and understands 
the parson yea they understand one another he dies the parson 
introduces him into eternity for the price of   but a self he was 
not and a self he did not become 

This form of despair is despair at not willing to be oneself or still 
lower despair at not willing to be a self or lowest of all despair at 

 



willing to be another than himself wishing for a new self Properly 
speaking immediacy has no self it does not recognize itself so neither 
can it recognize itself again it terminates therefore preferably in the 
romantic When immediacy despairs it possesses not even enough self 
to wish or to dream that it had become what it did not become The 
immediate man helps himself in a different way he wishes to be 
another Of this one may easily convince oneself by observing 
immediate men At the moment of despair no wish is so natural to 
them as the wish that they had become or might become another In 
any case one can never forbear to smile at such a despairer who 
humanly speaking although he is in despair is so very innocent 
Commonly such a despairer is infinitely comic Think of a self and next 
to God there is nothing so eternal as a self and then that this self gets 
the notion of asking whether it might not let itself become or be made 
into another   than itself And yet such a despairer whose only wish 
is this most crazy of all transformations loves to think that this change 
might be accomplished as easily as changing a coat For the immediate 
man does not recognize his self he recognizes himself only by his 
dress he recognizes and here again appears the infinitely comic trait 
he recognizes that he has a self only by externals There is no more 
ludicrous confusion for a self is just infinitely different from externals 
When then the whole of existence has been altered for the immediate 
man and he has fallen into despair he goes a step further he thinks 
thus this has become his wish What if I were to become another 
were to get myself a new self Yes but if he did become another I 
wonder if he would recognize himself again It is related of a peasant 
who came cleanly shaven to the Capital and had made so much money 
that he could buy himself a pair of shoes and stockings and still had 
enough left over to get drunk on  it is related that as he was trying 

 



in his drunken state to find his way home he lay down in the middle of 
the highway and fell asleep Then along came a wagon and the driver 
shouted to him to move or he would run over his legs Then the 
drunken peasant awoke looked at his legs and since by reason of the 
shoes and stockings he didnt recognize them he said to the driver 
Drive on they are not my legs So in the case of the immediate man 
when he is in despair it is impossible to represent him truly without a 
touch of the comic it is if I may say so a clever trick to talk in this 
jargon about a self and about despair 

When immediacy is assumed to have selfreflection despair is 
somewhat modified there is somewhat more consciousness of the self 
and therewith in turn of what despair is and of the fact that ones 
condition is despair there is some sense in it when such a man talks of 
being in despair but the despair is essentially that of weakness a 
passive experience its form is in despair at not wanting to be oneself 

The progress in this case compared with pure immediacy is at once 
evident in the fact that the despair does not always come about by 
reason of a blow by something that happens but may be occasioned 
by the mere reflection within oneself so that in this case despair is not 
a purely passive defeat by outward circumstances but to a certain 
degree is selfactivity action Here there is in fact a certain degree of 
selfreflection and so a certain degree of observation of oneself With 
this certain degree of selfreflection begins the act of discrimination 
whereby the self becomes aware of itself as something essentially 
different from the environment from externalities and their effect 
upon it But this is only to a certain degree Now when the self with a 
certain degree of selfreflection wills to accept itself it stumbles 
perhaps upon one difficulty or another in the composition of the self 

 



For as no human body is perfection so neither is any self This 
difficulty be it what it may frightens the man away shudderingly Or 
something happens to him which causes within him a breach with 
immediacy deeper than he has made by reflection Or his imagination 
discovers a possibility which if it were to come to pass would likewise 
become a breach with immediacy 

So he despairs His despair is that of weakness a passive suffering of 
the self in contrast to the despair of selfassertion but by the aid of 
relative selfreflection which he has he makes an effort which again 
distinguishes him from the purely immediate man to defend his self 
He understands that the thing of letting the self go is a pretty serious 
business after all he is not so apoplectically muddled by the blow as 
the immediate man is he understands by the aid of reflection that 
there is much he may lose without losing the self he makes 
admissions is capable of doing so  and why Because to a certain 
degree he has dissociated his self from external circumstances because 
he has an obscure conception that there may even be something 
eternal in the self But in vain he struggles thus the difficulty he 
stumbled against demands a breach with immediacy as a whole and 
for that he has not sufficient selfreflection or ethical reflection he has 
no consciousness of a self which is gained by the infinite abstraction 
from everything outward this naked abstract self in contrast to the 
clothed self of immediacy which is the first form of the infinite self 
and the forward impulse in the whole process whereby a self infinitely 
accepts its actual self with all its difficulties and advantages 

So then he despairs and his despair is not willing to be himself On 
the other hand the ludicrous notion of wanting to be another never 
occurs to him he maintains the relationship to his self  to that 

 



extent reflection has identified him with the self He then is in just 
such a situation with regard to the self as a man may be with regard to 
his dwellingplace The comic feature is that a self certainly does not 
stand in such a casual relation to itself as does a man to his dwelling
place A man finds his dwellingplace distasteful either because the 
chimney smokes or for any other reason whatsoever so he leaves it 
but he does not move out he does not engage a new dwelling he 
continues to regard the old one as his habitation he reckons that the 
offense will pass away So it is with the despairer As long as the 
difficulty lasts he does not dare to come to himself as the common 
phrase expresses it with singular pregnancy he does not want to be 
himself  but that surely will pass by perhaps things will change the 
dark possibility will surely be forgotten So meanwhile he comes to 
himself only once in a while as it were on a visit to see whether the 
change has not occurred and so soon as it has occurred he moves 
home again is again himself so he says However this only means 
that he begins again where he left off he was to a certain degree a self 
of a sort and he became nothing more 

But if no change occurs he helps himself in another way He swings 
away entirely from the inward direction which is the path he ought to 
have followed in order to become truly a self The whole problem of 
the self in a deeper sense becomes a sort of blind door in the 
background of his soul behind which there is nothing He accepts what 
in his language he calls his self that is to say whatever abilities 
talents etc may have been given him all this he accepts yet with the 
outward direction toward what is called life the real the active life he 
treats with great precaution the bit of selfreflection which he has in 
himself he is afraid that this thing in the background might again 

 



emerge So little by little he succeeds in forgetting it in the course of 
years he finds it almost ludicrous especially when he is in good 
company with other capable and active men who have a sense and 
capacity for real life Charmant He has now as they say in romances 
been happily married for a number of years is an active and 
enterprising man a father and a citizen perhaps even a great man at 
home in his own house the servants speak of him as himself in the 
city he is among the honoratiores his bearing suggests respect of 
persons or that he is to be respected as a person to all appearance he 
is to be regarded as a person In Christendom he is a Christian quite in 
the same sense in which in paganism he would have been a pagan and 
in England an Englishman one of the cultured Christians The 
question of immortality has often been in his mind more than once he 
has asked the parson whether there really was such an immortality 
whether one would really recognize oneself again  which indeed 
must have for him a very singular interest since he has no self 

It is impossible to represent truly this sort of despair without a certain 
admixture of satire The comical thing is that he will talk about having 
been in despair the dreadful thing is that after having as he thinks 
overcome despair he is then precisely in despair It is infinitely comic 
that at the bottom of the practical wisdom which is so much extolled 
in the world at the bottom of all the devilish lot of good counsel and 
wise saws and wait and see and put up with ones fate and write 
in the book of forgetfulness  that at the bottom of all this ideally 
understood lies complete stupidity as to where the danger really is and 
what the danger really is But again this ethical stupidity is the dreadful 
thing 

 



Despair over the earthly or over something earthly is the commonest 
sort of despair especially in the second form of immediacy with a 
quantitative reflection The more thoroughly reflected the despair is 
the more rarely it occurs in the world But this proves that most men 
have not become very deep even in despair it by no means proves 
however that they are not in despair There are very few men who live 
even only passably in the category of spirit yea there are not many 
even who merely make an attempt at this life and most of those who 
do so shy away They have not learned to fear they have not learned 
what must means regardless infinitely regardless of what it may be 
that comes to pass Therefore they cannot endure what even to them 
seems a contradiction and which as reflected from the world around 
them appears much more glaring that to be concerned for ones own 
soul and to want to be spirit is a waste of time yes an inexcusable 
waste of time which ought if possible to be punishable by law at all 
events is punished by contempt and ridicule as a sort of treason 
against men as a froward madness which crazily fills up time with 
nothing Then there is a period in their lives alas their best period 
when they begin after all to take the inward direction They get about 
as far as the first difficulties there they veer away it seems to them as 
though this road were leading to a disconsolate desert  und rings 
umher liegt schne grne Weide and all about lie beautiful green 
pastures So they are off and soon they forget that best period of 
theirs and alas they forget it as though it were a bit of childishness 
At the same time they are Christians tranquilized by the parson with 
regard to their salvation This despair as I have said is the commonest 
it is so common that only thereby can one explain the rather common 
opinion in common intercourse that despair is something belonging to 
youth which appears only in youthful years but is not to be found in 

 



the settled man who has come to the age of maturity and the years of 
wisdom This is a desperate error or rather a desperate mistake which 
overlooks yes and what is worse it overlooks the fact that what it 
overlooks is pretty nearly the best thing that can be said of a man 
since far worse often occurs  it overlooks the fact that the majority 
of men do never really manage in their whole life to be more than they 
were in childhood and youth namely immediacy with the addition of 
a little dose of selfreflection No despair verily is not something which 
appears only in the young something out of which one grows as a 
matter of course  as one grows out of illusion But neither is 
illusion something one grows out of though people are foolish enough 
to think so On the contrary one encounters grown men and women 
and aged persons who have as much childish illusion as any youth 
People overlook the fact that illusion has essentially two forms that of 
hope and that of recollection But just because the older person is 
under illusion he has also an entirely onesided conception of what 
illusion is thinking that it is only the illusion of hope And this is 
natural The older man is not plagued by the illusion of hope but he is 
on the other hand by the whimsical idea of looking down at the 
illusion of youth from a supposedly superior standpoint which is free 
from illusion The youth is under illusion he hopes for the 
extraordinary from life and from himself By way of compensation one 
often finds in an older man illusion with respect to the recollections of 
his youth An elderly woman who has now supposedly given up all 
illusions is often found to be as fantastic in her illusion as any young 
girl with respect to how she remembers herself as a girl how happy 
she once was how beautiful etc This fuimus we have been which is 
so often heard from old people is fully as great an illusion as the 

 



futuristic illusion of the youth They both of them are lying or 
poetizing 

But far more desperate than this is the mistake that despair belongs 
only to youth In the main it is a great folly and precisely it is a lack of 
sense as to what spirit is and moreover it is failure to appreciate that 
man is spirit not merely an animal when one supposes that it might 
be such an easy matter to acquire faith and wisdom which come with 
the years as a matter of course like teeth and a beard and such like 
No whatever it may be that a man as a matter of course comes to and 
whatever it may be that comes to a man as a matter of course  one 
thing it is not namely faith and wisdom But the thing is this with 
the years man does not spiritually understood come to anything on 
the other hand it is very easy with the years to go from something 
And with the years one perhaps goes from the bit of passion feeling 
imagination the bit of inwardness which one had and goes as a 
matter of course for such things go as a matter of course under 
trivialitys definition of understanding of life This    improved 
condition which true enough has come about with the years he now 
in despair regards as a good he readily assures himself and in a certain 
satirical sense there is nothing more sure that it now never could occur 
to him to despair  no he has assured himself against this yet he is in 
despair spiritually in despair Why I wonder did Socrates love youths  
unless it was because he knew men 

And if it does not so happen that a man with the years sinks into the 
most trivial kind of despair from this it does not by any means follow 
that despair might belong only to youth If a man really develops with 
the years if he ripens into essential consciousness of the self he may 
perhaps despair in a higher form And if he does not essentially develop 

 



with the years nor yet sink into sheer triviality that is to say if he 
remains pretty much a young man a youth although he is mature a 
father and grayhaired retaining therefore something of the good 
traits of youth then indeed he will be exposed also to the possibility of 
despairing as a youth over the earthly or over something earthly 

So a difference there may well be between the despair of an older man 
and a youth but no essential difference only a fortuitous one The 
youth despairs over the future as a present tense in futuro there is 
something in the future he is not willing to accept with this he will 
not be himself The older man despairs over the past as a present in 
praeterito which refuses to become more and more past  for so 
desperate he is not that he entirely succeeds in forgetting it This past 
is perhaps something even which repentance should have taken in 
hand But if repentance were to emerge one would first have to 
despair completely to despair out and out and then the spiritlife 
might break through from the very bottom But desperate as he is he 
dare not let the thing come to such a pass So there he remains 
standing time goes on  unless he succeeds still more desperately by 
the help of forgetfulness in healing it so that instead of becoming a 
repenter he becomes his own healer or accomplice as the word would 
be more commonly understood But such despair whether it be of the 
youth or of the man is essentially the same it does not reach any 
metamorphosis in which the consciousness of the eternal in the self 
breaks through so that the battle might begin which either potentiates 
despair to a higher power or leads to faith 

But is there no essential difference between the two expressions 
hitherto used as identical to despair over the earthly the determinant 
of totality and to despair over something earthly the particular 

 



Indeed there is When with infinite passion the self by means of 
imagination despairs over something earthly this infinite passion 
transforms this particular this something into the earthly in toto that 
is to say the determinant of totality inheres in and belongs to the 
despairer The earthly and temporal as such are precisely what falls 
apart into the particular It is impossible actually to lose or be deprived 
of all that is earthly for the determinant of totality is a thought
determinant So the self first increases infinitely the actual loss and 
then it despairs over the earthly in toto But so soon as this distinction 
between despairing over the earthly and over something earthly is 
essentially armed there is also an essential advance made in the 
consciousness of the self This formula to be in despair over the 
earthly is a dialectic first expression for the next form of despair 

ii Despair about the eternal or over oneself 

Despair over the earthly or over something earthly is really despair also 
about the eternal and over oneself in so far as it is despair for this is 
the formula for all despairTherefore it is linguistically correct to say 
in despair over the earthly the occasion and about the eternal 
but over oneself because this is again another expression for the 
occasion of despair which in its concept is always about the eternal 
whereas that over which one despairs may be of the most various sorts 
One despairs over that which fixes one in despair over ones 
misfortune for example over the earthly over the loss of ones 
fortune but about that which rightly understood releases one from 
despair therefore about the eternal about ones salvation about ones 
own rower etc In relation to the self one employs both words to 
despair over and about oneself because the self is doubly dialectic 
And herein consists the obscurity especially in all lower forms of 

 



despair and in almost all despairers that with such passionate 
clearness a man sees and knows over what he is in despair but about 
what it is escapes his notice The condition requisite for healing it 
always this aboutface and from a purely philosophical point of view it 
might be a subtle question whether it is possible for one to be in 
despair with full consciousness of what it is about which one despairs 
But the despairer as he was depicted in the foregoing did not observe 
what was happening behind him so to speak he thinks he is in despair 
over something earthly and constantly talks about what he is in despair 
over and yet he is in despair about the eternal for the fact that he 
ascribes such great value to the earthly or to carry the thought 
further that he ascribes to something earthly such great value or that 
he first transforms something earthly into everything earthly and then 
ascribes to the earthly such great value is precisely to despair about 
the eternal 

This despair is now well in advance If the former was the despair of 
weakness this is despair over his weakness although it still remains as 
to its nature under the category despair of weakness as distinguished 
from defiance in the next section So there is only a relative difference 
This difference consists in the fact that the foregoing form has the 
consciousness of weakness as its final consciousness whereas in this 
case consciousness does not come to a stop here but potentiates itself 
to a new consciousness a consciousness of its weakness The despairer 
understands that it is weakness to take the earthly so much to heart 
that it is weakness to despair But then instead of veering sharply away 
from despair to faith humbling himself before God for his weakness 
he is more deeply absorbed in despair and despairs over his weakness 
Therewith the whole point of view is inverted he becomes now more 

 



clearly conscious of his despair recognizing that he is in despair about 
the eternal he despairs over himself that he could be weak enough to 
ascribe to the earthly such great importance which now becomes his 
despairing expression for the fact that he has lost the eternal and 
himself 

Here is the scale of ascent First in consciousness of himself for to 
despair about the eternal is impossible without having a conception 
about the sell that there is something eternal in it or that it has had 
something eternal in it And if a man is to despair over himself he 
must indeed be conscious also of having a self that however is the 
thing over which he despairs  not over the earthly or over something 
earthly but over himself Moreover there is in this case a greater 
consciousness of what despair is for despair is precisely to have lost 
the eternal and oneself As a matter of course there is greater 
consciousness of the fact that ones condition is that of despair 
Furthermore despair in this case is not merely passive suffering but 
action For when the earthly is taken away from the self and a man 
despairs it is as if despair came from without though it comes 
nevertheless always from the self indirectdirectly from the self as 
counterpressure reaction differing in this respect from defiance 
which comes directly from the self Finally there is here again though 
in another sense a further advance For just because this despair is 
more intense salvation is in a certain sense nearer Such a despair will 
hardly forget it is too deep but despair is held open every instant and 
there is thus possibility of salvation 

For all that this despair is to be referred to the formula in despair at 
not willing to be oneself Just as a father disinherits a son so the self is 
not willing to recognize itself after it has been so weak In its despair it 

 



cannot forget this weakness it hates itself in a way it will not humble 
itself in faith under its weakness in order to gain itself again no in its 
despair it will not hear of itself so to speak will not know anything 
about itself But there can be no question of being helped by 
forgetfulness no question of slipping by the aid of forgetfulness under 
the determinant of selflessness and so being a man and a Christian like 
other men and Christians no for this the self is too much a self As it 
often was the case with the father who disinherited his son that the 
outward fact was of little avail to him he did not by this get free of his 
son at least his thought did not as is often the case with the lovers 
curse upon the hated one ie the loved one that it does not help 
much it almost imprisons him the more  so it is in the case of the 
despairing self with relation to itself 

This despair is one quality deeper than the foregoing and is a sort 
which rarely is met with in the world That blind door behind which 
there was nothing is in this case a real door a door carefully locked to 
be sure and behind it sits as it were the self and watches itself 
employed in filling up time with not willing to be itself and yet is self 
enough to love itself This is what is called introversion And from now 
on we shall be dealing with introversion which is the direct opposite to 
immediacy and has a great contempt for it in the sphere of thought 
more especially 

But does there then in the realm of reality exist no such self Has he 
fled outside of reality to the desert to the cloister to the madhouse 
Is he not a real man clothed like others or like others clad in the 
customary outergarments Yes certainly there is Why not But with 
respect to this thing of the self he initiates no one not a soul he feels 
no urge to do this or he has learnt to suppress it Hear how he talks 

 



about it After all its only the purely immediate men  who so far as 
spirit is concerned are about at the same point as the child in the first 
period of earliest infancy when with a thoroughly endearing 
nonchalance it lets everything pass out  its the purely immediate 
men who cant retain anything It is this sort of immediacy which often 
with great pretentiousness proclaims itself truth that one is a true 
man and just like people generally are  which is just as true as it is 
untrue that a grown man as soon as he feels a corporal need at once 
yields to it Every self which is even a little bit reflective has surely a 
notion of what it is to repress the self And our despairer is introverted 
enough to be able to keep every intruder that is every man at a 
distance from the topic of the self whereas outwardly he is completely 
a real man He is a university man husband and father an 
uncommonly competent civil functionary even a respectable father 
very gentle to his wife and carefulness itself with respect to his 
children And a Christian Well yes he is that too after a sort however 
he preferably avoids talking on the subject although he willingly 
observes and with a melancholy joy that his wife for her edification 
engages in devotions He very seldom goes to church because it seems 
to him that most parsons really dont know what they are talking 
about He makes an exception in the case of one particular priest of 
whom he concedes that he knows what he is talking about but he 
doesnt want to hear him for another reason because he has a fear 
that this might lead him too far On the other hand he often feels a 
need of solitude which for him is a vital necessity  sometimes like 
breathing at other times like sleeping The fact that he feels this vital 
necessity more than other men is also a sign that he has a deeper 
nature Generally the need of solitude is a sign that there is spirit in a 
man after all and it is a measure for what spirit there is The purely 

 



twaddling inhuman and toohuman men are to such a degree without 
feeling for the need of solitude that like a certain species of social birds 
the socalled love birds they promptly die if for an instant they have 
to be alone As the little child must be put to sleep by a lullaby so 
these men need the tranquilizing hum of society before they are able 
to eat drink sleep pray fall in love etc But in ancient times as well 
as in the Middle Ages people were aware of the need of solitude and 
had respect for what it signifies In the constant sociability of our age 
people shudder at solitude to such a degree that they know no other 
use to put it to but oh admirable epigram as a punishment for 
criminals But after all it is a fact that in our age it is a crime to have 
spirit so it is natural that such people the lovers of solitude are 
included in the same class with criminals 

The introverted despairer thus lives on horis succesivis successive 
hours through hours which though they are not lived for eternity 
have nevertheless something to do with the eternal being employed 
about the relationship of ones self to itself  but he really gets no 
further than this So when this is done when the need for solitude is 
satisfied he goes outside as it were  even when he goes in to 
converse with wife and children That which as a husband makes him 
so gentle and as a father so careful is apart from his goodnature and 
his sense of duty the admission he has made to himself in his most 
inward reserve concerning his weakness 

If it were possible for anyone to be privy to his introversion and were 
to say to him This is in fact pride thou art proud of thyself he 
would hardly be likely to admit it to another When he was alone with 
himself he would likely admit that there was something in it but the 
passionateness with which his self had pictured his weakness would 

 



quickly make him believe again that it could not possibly be pride for 
it was in fact precisely over his weakness he was in despair  just as if 
it were not pride which attached such prodigious weight to weakness 
just as if it were not because he wanted to be proud of himself that he 
could not endure this consciousness of weakness  If one were to say 
to him This is a strange complication a strange sort of knot for the 
whole misfortune consists in the way thought is twined otherwise the 
direction is quite normal it is just this path you must travel through 
the despair of the self to faith It is true enough about the weakness 
but it is not over this you must despair the self must be broken in 
order to become a self so cease to despair over it If one were to talk 
to him thus he would perhaps understand it in a dispassionate 
moment but soon passion would again see falsely and so again he 
takes the wrong turn into despair 

As I have said such despair is rather rare If it does not stay at that 
point merely marking time and if on the other hand there does not 
occur a radical change in the despairer so that he gets on the right 
path to faith then such despair will either potentiate itself to a higher 
form and continue to be introversion or it breaks through to the 
outside and demolishes the outward disguise under which the 
despairing man has been living in his incognito In the latter case such 
a despairer will then plunge into life perhaps into the distractions of 
great undertakings he will become a restless spirit which leaves only 
too clear a trace of its actual presence a restless spirit which wants to 
forget and inasmuch as the noise within is so loud stronger means are 
needed though of a different sort than those which Richard III 
employs in order not to hear his mothers curses Or he will seek 
forgetfulness in sensuality perhaps in debauchery in desperation he 

 



wants to return to immediacy but constantly with consciousness of the 
self which he does not want to have In the first case when despair is 
potentiated it becomes defiance and it now becomes manifest how 
much truth there was in this notion of weakness it becomes manifest 
how dialectically correct it is to say that the first expression of defiance 
is precisely despair over ones weakness 

However let us in conclusion take another little look at the introvert 
who in his introversion marks time on the spot If this introversion is 
absolutely maintained omnibus numeris absoluta perfect in every 
respect then suicide will be the danger nearest to him The common 
run of men have of course no presentiment of what such an introvert 
is capable of bearing if they were to come to know it they would be 
astonished If on the other hand he talks to someone if to one single 
man he opens his heart he is in all probability strained to so high a 
tension or so much let down that suicide does not result from 
introversion Such an introvert with one person privy to his thought is 
a whole tone milder than the absolute case He probably will shun 
suicide It may happen however that he falls into despair just for the 
fact that he has opened his heart to another it may be that he thinks 
it would have been infinitely preferable to maintain silence rather than 
have anyone privy to his secret There are examples of introverts who 
are brought to despair precisely because they have acquired a 
confidant So after all suicide may be the consequence Poetically the 
catastrophe assuming poetice that the protagonist was eg a king or 
emperor might be fashioned in such a way that the hero had the 
confidant put to death One could imagine such a demoniacal tyrant 
who felt the need of talking to a fellowman about his torment and in 
this way consumed successively a whole lot of men for to be his 

 



confidant was certain death  It would be the task for a poet to 
represent this agonizing selfcontradiction in a demoniac man who is 
not able to get along without a confidant and not able to have a 
confidant and then resolving it in such a way as this 

 The despair of willing despairingly to be oneself  defiance 

As it was shown that one might call the despair dealt with in section  
the despair of womanliness so one might call the despair now to be 
considered the despair of manliness In connection with the kind just 
described it may be called despair viewed under the determinant of 
spirit But this manliness belongs more precisely under the determinant 
of spirit and womanliness is a lower synthesis 

The despair described in section  ii was despair over ones weakness 
the despairer does not want to be himself But if one goes one single 
dialectical step further if despair thus becomes conscious of the reason 
why it does not want to be itself then the case is altered then 
defiance is present for then it is precisely because of this a man is 
despairingly determined to be himself 

First comes despair over the earthly or something earthly then despair 
over oneself about the eternal Then comes defiance which really is 
despair by the aid of the eternal the despairing abuse of the eternal in 
the self to the point of being despairingly determined to be oneself 
But just because it is despair by the aid of the eternal it lies in a sense 
very close to the true and just because it lies very close to the true it is 
infinitely remote The despair which is the passageway to faith is also 
by the aid of the eternal by the aid of the eternal the self has courage 

 



to lose itself in order to gain itself Here on the contrary it is not 
willing to begin by losing itself but wills to be itself 

In this form of despair there is now a mounting consciousness of the 
self and hence greater consciousness of what despair is and of the fact 
that ones condition is that of despair Here despair is conscious of 
itself as a deed it does not come from without as a suffering under the 
pressure of circumstances it comes directly from the self And so after 
all defiance is a new qualification added to despair over one weakness 

In order to will in despair to be oneself there must be consciousness of 
the infinite self This infinite self however is really only the abstractest 
form the abstractest possibility of the self and it is this self the man 
despairingly wills to be detaching the self from every relation to the 
Power which posited it or detaching it from the conception that there 
is such a Power in existence By the aid of this infinite form the self 
despairingly wills to dispose of itself or to create itself to make itself 
the self it wills to be distinguishing in the concrete self what it will 
and what it will not accept The mans concrete self or his concretion 
has in fact necessity and limitations it is this perfectly definite thing 
with these faculties dispositions etc But by the aid of the infinite 
form the negative self he wills first to undertake to refashion the 
whole thing in order to get out of it in this way a self such as he 
wants to have produced by the aid of the infinite form of the negative 
self  and it is thus he wills to be himself That is to say he is not 
willing to begin with the beginning but in the beginning He is not 
willing to attire himself in himself nor to see his task in the self given 
him by the aid of being the infinite form he wills to construct it 
himself 

 



If one would have a common name for this despair one might call it 
Stoicism  yet without thinking only of this philosophic sect And to 
illuminate this sort of despair more sharply one would do well to 
distinguish between the active and the passive self showing how the 
self is related to itself when it is active and how it is related to itself in 
suffering when it is passive and showing that the formula constantly 
is in despair to will to be oneself 

If the despairing self is active it really is related to itself only as 
experimenting with whatsoever it be that it undertakes however great 
it may be however astonishing however persistently carried out It 
acknowledges no power over it hence in the last resort it lacks 
seriousness and is able only to conjure up a show of seriousness when 
the self bestows upon its experiments its utmost attention Like the fire 
which Prometheus stole from the gods so does this mean to steal from 
God the thought which is seriousness that God is regarding one 
instead of which the despairing self is content with regarding itself 
and by that it is supposed to bestow upon its undertakings infinite 
interest and importance whereas it is precisely this which makes them 
mere experiments For though this self were to go so far in despair that 
it becomes an experimental god no derived self can by regarding itself 
give itself more than it is it nevertheless remains from first to last the 
self by selfduplication it becomes neither more nor less than the self 
Hence the self in its despairing effort to will to be itself labors itself 
into the direct opposite it becomes really no self In the whole dialectic 
within which it acts there is nothing firm what the self is does not for 
an instant stand firm that is eternally firm The negative form of the 
self exercises quite as much the power of loosing as of binding every 
instant it can quite arbitrarily begin all over again and however far a 

 



thought may be pursued the whole action is within a hypothesis It is 
so far from being true that the self succeeds more and more in 
becoming itself that in fact it merely becomes more and more manifest 
that it is a hypothetical self The self is its own lord and master so it is 
said absolutely its own lord and precisely this is despair but it also is 
what it regards as its pleasure and enjoyment However by closer 
inspection one easily ascertains that this ruler is a king without a 
country he rules really over nothing his condition his dominion is 
subjected to the dialectic that every instant revolution is legitimate For 
in the last resort this depends arbitrarily upon the self 

So the despairing self is constantly building nothing but castles in the 
air it fights only in the air All these experimented virtues make a 
brilliant showing for an instant they are enchanting like an oriental 
poem such selfcontrol such firmness such ataraxia etc border 
almost on the fabulous Yes they do to be sure and also at the 
bottom of it all there is nothing The self wants to enjoy the entire 
satisfaction of making itself into itself of developing itself of being 
itself it wants to have the honor of this poetical this masterly plan 
according to which it has understood itself And yet in the last resort it 
is a riddle how it understands itself just at the instant when it seems 
to be nearest to having the fabric finished it can arbitrarily resolve the 
whole thing into nothing 

If the despairing self is a passive sufferer we have still the same 
formula in despair at willing to be oneself Perhaps such an 
experimenting self which in despair wills to be itself at the moment 
when it is making a preliminary exploration of its concrete self 
stumbles upon one or another hardship of the sort that the Christian 
would call a cross a fundamental defect it matters not what The 

 



negative self the infinite form of the self will perhaps cast this clean 
away pretend that it does not exist want to know nothing about it 
But this does not succeed its virtuosity in experimenting does not 
extend so far nor does its virtuosity in abstraction like Prometheus the 
infinite negative self feels that it is nailed to this servitude So then it 
is a passively suffering self How then does the despair which 
despairingly wills to be itself display itself in this case 

Note that in the foregoing the form of despair was represented which 
is in despair over the earthly or over something earthly so understood 
that at bottom this is and also shows itself to be despair about the 
eternal ie despair which wills not to let itself be comforted by the 
eternal which rates the earthly so high that the eternal can be of no 
comfort But this too is a form of despair not to be willing to hope 
that an earthly distress a temporal cross might be removed This is 
what the despair which wills desperately to be itself is not willing to 
hope It has convinced itself that this thorn in the flesh gnaws so 
profoundly that he cannot abstract it  no matter whether this is 
actually so or his passion makes it true for himFrom this standpoint it 
is well to note here one will see also that much which is embellished 
by the name of resignation is a kind of despair that of willing 
despairingly to be ones abstract self of willing despairingly to be 
satisfied with the eternal and thereby be able to defy or ignore 
suffering in the earthly and temporal sphere The dialectic of 
resignation is commonly this to will to be ones eternal self and then 
with respect to something positive wherein the self suffers not to will 
to be oneself contenting oneself with the thought that after all this 
will disappear in eternity thinking itself therefore justified in not 
accepting it in time so that although suffering under it the self will 

 



not make to it the concession that it properly belongs to the self that 
is it will not humble itself under it in faith Resignation regarded as 
despair is essentially different from the form in despair at not willing 
to be oneself for it wills desperately to be itself  with exception 
however of one particular with respect to which it wills despairingly 
not to be itself and so he is willing to accept it as it were eternally So 
he is offended by it or rather from it he takes occasion to be offended 
at the whole of existence in spite of it he would be himself not 
despitefully be himself without it for that is to abstract from it and 
that he cannot do or that would be a movement in the direction of 
resignation no in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he 
wills to be himself with it to take it along almost defying his torment 
For to hope in the possibility of help not to speak of help by virtue of 
the absurd that for God all things are possible  no that he will not 
do And as for seeking help from any other  no that he will not do 
for all the world rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself  
with all the tortures of hell if so it must be 

And of a truth it is not quite so true after all when people say that it 
is a matter of course that a sufferer would be so glad to be helped if 
only somebody would help him  this is far from being the case even 
though the opposite case is not always so desperate as this The 
situation is this A sufferer has one or more ways in which he would be 
glad to be helped If he is helped thus he is willing to be helped But 
when in a deeper sense it becomes seriousness with this thing of 
needing help especially from a higher or from the highest source  
this humiliation of having to accept help unconditionally and in any 
way the humiliation of becoming nothing in the hand of the Helper 
for whom all things are possible or merely the necessity of deferring to 

 



another man of having to give up being oneself so long as one is 
seeking help  ah there are doubtless many sufferings even 
protracted and agonizing sufferings at which the self does not wince 
to this extent and which therefore at bottom it prefers to retain and to 
be itself 

But the more consciousness there is in such a sufferer who in despair is 
determined to be himself all the more does despair too potentiate 
itself and become demoniac The genesis of this is commonly as 
follows A self which in despair is determined to be itself winces at one 
pain or another which simply cannot be taken away or separated from 
its concrete self Precisely upon this torment the man directs his whole 
passion which at last becomes a demoniac rage Even if at this point 
God in heaven and all his angels were to offer to help him out of it  
no now he doesnt want it now it is too late he once would have 
given everything to be rid of this torment but was made to wait now 
thats all past now he would rather rage against everything he the 
one man in the whole of existence who is the most unjustly treated to 
whom it is especially important to have his torment at hand important 
that no one should take it from him  for thus he can convince 
himself that he is in the right This at last becomes so firmly fixed in 
his head that for a very peculiar reason he is afraid of eternity  for 
the reason namely that it might rid him of his demoniacally 
understood infinite advantage over other men his demoniacally 
understood justification for being what he is It is himself he wills to 
be he began with the infinite abstraction of the self and now at last 
he has become so concrete that it would be an impossibility to be 
eternal in that sense and yet he wills in despair to be himself Ah 

 



demoniac madness He rages most of all at the thought that eternity 
might get it into its head to take his misery from him 

This sort of despair is seldom seen in the world such figures generally 
are met with only in the works of poets that is to say of real poets 
who always lend their characters this demoniac ideality taking this 
word in the purely Greek sense Nevertheless such a despairer is to be 
met with also in real life What then is the corresponding outward 
mark Well there is no corresponding mark for in fact a 
corresponding outward expression corresponding to close reserve is a 
contradiction in terms for if it is corresponding it is then of course 
revealing But outwardness is the entirely indifferent factor in this case 
where introversion or what one might call inwardness with a jammed 
lock is so much the predominant factor The lowest forms of despair 
where there really was no inwardness or at all events none worth 
talking about the lowest forms of despair one might represent by 
describing or by saying something about the outward traits of the 
despairer But the more despair becomes spiritual and the more 
inwardness becomes a peculiar world for itself in introversion all the 
more is the self alert with demoniac shrewdness to keep despair shut 
up in close reserve and all the more intent therefore to set the 
outward appearance at the level of indifference to make it as 
unrevealing and indifferent as possible As according to the report of 
superstition the troll disappears through a crack which no one can 
perceive so it is for the despairer all the more important to dwell in an 
exterior semblance behind which it ordinarily would never occur to 
anyone to look for it This hiddenness is precisely something spiritual 
and is one of the safetydevices for assuring oneself of having as it 
were behind reality an enclosure a world for itself locking all else out 

 



a world where the despairing self is employed as tirelessly as Tantalus 
in willing to be itself 

We began in section  ii with the lowest form of despair which in 
despair does not will to be itself The demoniac despair is the most 
potentiated form of the despair which despairingly wills to be itself 
This despair does not will to be itself with Stoic doting upon itself nor 
with selfdeification willing in this way doubtless mendaciously yet in 
a certain sense in terms of its perfection no with hatred for existence 
it wills to be itself to be itself in terms of its misery it does not even 
in defiance or defiantly will to be itself but to be itself in spite it does 
not even will in defiance to tear itself free from the Power which 
posited it it wills to obtrude upon this Power in spite to hold on to it 
out of malice And that is natural a malignant objection must above 
all take care to hold on to that against which it is an objection 
Revolting against the whole of existence it thinks it has hold of a 
proof against it against its goodness This proof the despairer thinks 
he himself is and that is what he wills to be therefore he wills to be 
himself himself with his torment in order with this torment to protest 
against the whole of existence Whereas the weak despairer will not 
hear about what comfort eternity has for him so neither will such a 
despairer hear about it but for a different reason namely because this 
comfort would be the destruction of him as an objection against the 
whole of existence It is to describe it figuratively as if an author were 
to make a slip of the pen and that this clerical error became conscious 
of being such  perhaps it was no error but in a far higher sense was 
an essential constituent in the whole exposition  it is then as if this 
clerical error would revolt against the author out of hatred for him 
were to forbid him to correct it and were to say No I will not be 

 



erased I will stand as a witness against thee that thou art a very poor 
writer 

 



Part  Despair is Sin 

 

Chapter  Despair is Sin  

 

Sin is this before God or with the conception of God to be in despair 
at not willing to be oneself or in despair at willing to be oneself Thus 
sin is potentiated weakness or potentiated defiance sin is the 
potentiation of despair The point upon which the emphasis rests is 
before God or the fact that the conception of God is involved the 
factor which dialectically ethically religiously makes qualified 
despair to use a juridical term synonymous with sin is the conception 
of God 

Although in this Second Part and especially in this section there is no 
place or occasion for psychological description there here may be 
introduced as the most dialectical borderline between despair and sin 
what one might call a poetexistence in the direction of the religious 
an existence which has something in common with the despair of 
resignation only that the conception of God is involved Such an 
existence as is to be seen from the conjunction and position of the 
categories will be the most eminent poetexistence From a Christian 
standpoint such an existence in spite of all aesthetic is sin it is the 
sin of poetizing instead of being of standing in relation to the Good 
and the True through imagination instead of being that or rather 
existentially striving to be it The poetexistence here in question is 

 



distinguished from despair by the fact that it includes the conception 
of God or is before God but it is prodigiously dialectical and is in an 
impenetrable dialectical confusion as to how far it is conscious of 
being sin Such a poet may have a very deep religious need and the 
conception of God is included in his despair He loves God above 
everything God is for him the only comfort in his secret torment and 
yet he loves the torment he will not let it go He would so gladly be 
himself before God but not with respect to this fixed point where the 
self suffers there despairingly he will not be himself he hopes that 
eternity will remove it and here in the temporal however much he 
suffers under it he cannot will to accept it cannot humble himself 
under it in faith And yet he continues to hold to God and this is his 
only happiness for him it would be the greatest horror to have to do 
without God it would be enough to drive one to despair and yet he 
permits himself commonly but perhaps unconsciously to poetize God 
making him a little bit other than He is a little bit more like a loving 
father who all too much indulges the childs only wish He who 
became unhappy in love and therefore became a poet blissfully extolls 
the happiness of love  so he became a poet of religiousness he 
understands obscurely that it is required of him to let this torment go 
that is to humble himself under it in faith and to accept it as 
belonging to the self  for he would hold it aloof from him and 
thereby precisely he holds it fast although doubtless he thinks and 
this like every other word of despair is correct in the opposite sense 
and therefore must be understood inversely that this must mean 
separating himself from it as far as possible letting it go as far as it is 
possible for a man to do so But to accept it in faith that he cannot 
do or rather in the last resort he will not or here is where the self ends 
in obscurity But like that poets description of love so this poets 

 



description of the religious possesses an enchantment a lyrical flight 
such as no married mans description has nor that of his Reverence 
What he says is not untrue by no means his representation reflects his 
happier his better ego With respect to the religious he is an unhappy 
lover that is he is not in a strict sense a believer he has only the first 
prerequisite of faith and with that an ardent longing for the religious 
His collision is essentially this is he the elect is the thorn in the flesh 
the expression for the fact that he is to be employed as the 
extraordinary is it before God quite as it should be with respect to the 
extraordinary figure he has become or is the thorn in the flesh the 
experience he must humble himself under in order to attain the 
universal human But enough of this I can say with the emphasis of 
truth To whom am I talking Who will bother about such 
psychological investigations carried to the nth power The Nremburg 
Picture Books painted by priests are easily understood one and all 
they resemble deceptively people as they generally are and spiritually 
understood nothing 

 Gradations in the Consciousness of the Self The Qualification 
before God 

In the foregoing there is steadily pointed out a gradation in the 
consciousness of the self first came unconsciousness of beingan 
eternal self IIIB a then a knowledge of having a self in which there is 
after all something eternal IIIB b and under this  i and ii  there 
were again pointed out gradations This whole situation must now be 
turned about and viewed in a new way The point is this The 
gradations in the consciousness of the self with which we have hitherto 
been employed are within the definition of the human self or the self 
whose measure is man But this self acquires a new quality or 

 



qualification in the fact that it is the self directly in the sight of God 
This self is no longer the merely human self but is what I would call 
hoping not to be misunderstood the theological self the self directly 
in the sight of God And what an infinite reality this self acquires by 
being before God A herdsman who if this were possible is a self only 
in the sight of cows is a verylow self and so also is a ruler who is a 
self in the sight of slaves  for in both cases the scale or measure is 
lacking The child who hitherto has had only the parents to measure 
himself by becomes a self when he is a man by getting the state as a 
measure But what an infinite accent falls upon the self by getting God 
as a measure The measure for the self always is that in the face of 
which it is a self but this does not define what measure is As one 
can add up only magnitudes of the same order so each thing is 
qualitatively that by which it is measured and that which is 
qualitatively its measure Maalestok is ethically its goal Maal and the 
measure and goal are qualitatively that which something is  with 
exception of the relation which obtains in the world of freedom where 
a man by not being qualitatively that which is his goal and his measure 
must himself have deserved this disqualification so that the goal and 
the measure remains the same    condemningly making manifest 
what it is he is not that namely which is his goal and his measure 

It was a very just thought to which the older dogmatic frequently 
recurred whereas a later dogmatic so often censored it for lack of 
understanding and a proper sense of its meaning  it was a very just 
thought although sometimes a wrong application was made of it the 
thought that what makes sin so frightful is that it is before God From 
this the theologians proved the eternity of hellpunishment 
Subsequently they became shrewder and said Sin is sin sin is not 

 



greater because it is against God or before God Strange For even the 
jurists talk about qualified crimes and extenuating circumstances 
even the jurists make distinction with regard to a crime inquiring for 
example whether it is committed against a public functionary or a 
private person they prescribe a different punishment for the murder of 
a father and an ordinary murder 

No the earlier dogmatic was right in asserting that the fact that the sin 
was before God infinitely potentiated it Their fault lay in regarding 
God as something external and in assuming that it was only now and 
then men sinned against God But God is not something external in 
the sense that a policeman is What we need to emphasize is that the 
self has the conception of God and that then it does not will as He 
wills and so is disobedient Nor is it only now and then one sins before 
God for every sin is before God or rather it is this which properly 
makes human guilt to be sin 

Despair is potentiated in proportion to consciousness of self but the 
self is potentiated in the ratio of the measure proposed for the self 
and infinitely potentiated when God is the measure The more 
conception of God the more self the more self the more conception 
of God Only when the self as this definite individual is conscious of 
existing before God only then is it the infinite self and then this self 
sins before God The selfishness of paganism therefore in spite of all 
that can be said about it is not nearly so qualified as that of 
Christendom in so far as here also there is selfishness for the pagan 
did not possess his self directly in the face of God The pagan and the 
natural man have as their measure the merely human self One may be 
right therefore from a higher standpoint in regarding paganism as lying 
in sin but properly the sin of paganism was the despairing 

 



unawareness of God unawareness of existing before God this means 
to be without God in the world On the other hand it is for this 
reason true that the pagan did not sin in the strictest sense for he did 
not sin before God Moreover it is also in a sense quite certain that 
many a time a pagan is enabled in a way to slip through the world 
irreproachably precisely because his lightminded Pelagian 
interpretation saved him but then his sin is a different one namely 
this lightminded interpretation On the other hand and in a different 
aspect it is quite certain that just by being brought up strictly in 
Christianity a man has in a certain sense been plunged into sin 
because the whole Christian view was too serious for him especially in 
an earlier period of his life but then in another sense this is again of 
some help to him this deeper apprehension of what sin is 

Sin is before God in despair not to will to be oneself or before God in 
despair to will to be oneself But is not this definition even though in 
other aspects it may be conceded to have advantages and among 
them this which is the weightiest of all that it is the only Scriptural 
definition for the Scripture always defines sin as disobedience is it 
not after all too spiritual To this one must first of all make answer 
that a definition of sin can never be too spiritual unless it becomes so 
spiritual that it does away with sin for sin is precisely a determinant 
of spirit And in the next place why should it then be too spiritual 
Because it does not talk about murder theft unchastity etc But does 
it not talk of them Is it not also selfassertion against God when one 
is disobedient and defies His commandment But on the other hand 
when in talking about sin one talks only of such sins it is so easily 
forgotten that in a way it may be all right humanly speaking with 
respect to all such things up to a certain point and yet the whole life 

 



may be sin the wellknown kind of sin glittering vices willfulness 
which either spiritlessly or impudently continues to be or wills to be 
unaware in what an infinitely deeper sense a human self is morally 
under obligation to God with respect to every most secret wish and 
thought with respect to quickness in comprehending and readiness to 
follow every hint of God as to what His will is for this self The sins of 
the flesh are the selfassertion of the lower self but how often one 
devil is cast out by the devils help and the last state becomes worse 
than the first For so it is with men in this world first a man sins from 
frailty and weakness and then  yes then perhaps he learns to flee to 
God and to be helped by faith which saves from all sin but of this we 
are not talking here  then he despairs over his weakness and 
becomes either a Pharisee who in despair manages to attain a certain 
legal righteousness or he despairs and plunges again into sin 

The definition therefore certainly embraces every conceivable and 
actual form of sin it certainly throws into relief the decisive fact that 
sin is despair for sin is not the wildness of flesh and blood but it is 
the spirits consent thereto and it is    before God As a definition it 
is algebraic In this little work it would be out of place and an effort 
moreover which perhaps would not succeed were I to begin by 
describing the particular sins The principal thing here is that the 
definition like a net must embrace all forms And that it does as can 
be seen when one tests it by setting up the opposite namely the 
definition of faith by which I steer my course in the whole of this 
work as by a sure mariners mark Faith is that the self in being itself 
and in willing to be itself is grounded transparently in God 

But too often it has been overlooked that the opposite of sin is not 
virtue not by any manner of means This is in part a pagan view which 

 



is content with a merely human measure and properly does not know 
what sin is that all sin is before God No the opposite of sin is faith 
as is affirmed in Rom  whatsoever is not of faith is sin And 
for the whole of Christianity it is one of the most decisive definitions 
that the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith 

Appendix That the Definition of Sin Contains the Possibility of the 
Offense  A General Observation about Offense 

The opposition sinfaith is the Christian one which in a Christian way 
transforms the definition of all ethical concepts giving them one 
distillation the more At the bottom of this opposition lies the decisive 
Christian concept before God a determinant which in turn stands in 
relation to the decisive criterion of Christianity the absurd the 
paradox the possibility of offense And that this should be indicated in 
every definition of Christianity is of the utmost importance for the 
offense is Christianitys defense against all speculation In this instance 
where is the possibility of the offense It lies in the fact that a man as 
a particular individual should have such a reality as is implied by 
existing directly in the sight of God and then again and as a 
consequence of this that a man s sin should concern God This notion 
of the particular man    before God speculative philosophy never gets 
into its head it can only universalize the particular man fantastically It 
was just for this reason also that an incredulous Christianity made out 
that sin is sin no matter whether it is directly in the sight of God or 
not That is to say they wanted to do away with the determinant 
before God and to this end they discovered a higher wisdom  
which however strangely enough was neither more nor less than what 
the higher wisdom no doubt generally is    the old paganism 

 



There is so much said now about people being offended at Christianity 
because it is so dark and gloomy offended at it because it is so severe 
etc It is now high time to explain that the real reason why man is 
offended at Christianity is because it is too high because its goal is not 
mans goal because it would make of a man something so 
extraordinary that he is unable to get it into his head A perfectly 
simple psychological investigation of what offense is will explain this 
and at the same time it will show how infinitely silly their behavior has 
been who defended Christianity by taking away the offense how 
stupidly or impudently they have ignored Christs own instruction who 
often and with such deep concern warns against the offense that is 
intimates that the possibility of the offense is present and must be 
everpresent for if it is not present if it is not an eternally essential 
constituent of Christianity it is nonsense humanly speaking for Christ 
instead of taking it away to be distressed about it and to give warning 
against it 

If I were to imagine to myself a daylaborer and the mightiest emperor 
that ever lived and were to imagine that this mighty Emperor took a 
notion to send for the poor man who never had dreamed neither had 
it entered into his heart to believe that the Emperor knew of his 
existence and who therefore would think himself indescribably 
fortunate if merely he was permitted once to see the Emperor and 
would recount it to his children and childrens children as the most 
important event of his life  but suppose the Emperor sent for him 
and informed him that he wished to have him for his soninlaw    
what then Then the laborer humanly would become somewhat or 
very much puzzled shamefaced and embarrassed and it would seem 
to him quite humanly and this is the human element in it something 

 



exceedingly strange something quite mad the last thing in the world 
about which he would say a word to anybody else since he himself in 
his own mind was not far from explaining it by supposing as his 
neighbors would be busily doing as soon as possible that the Emperor 
wanted to make a fool of him so that the poor man would be the 
laughingstock of the whole town his picture in the papers the story 
of his espousal to the Emperors daughter the theme of ballad
mongers This thing however of becoming the Emperors soninlaw 
might readily be subjected to the tests of reality so that the laborer 
would he able to ascertain how far the Emperor was serious in this 
matter or whether he merely wanted to make fun of the poor fellow 
render him unhappy for the rest of his life and help him to find his 
way to the madhouse for the quid nimis is in evidence which with 
such infinite ease can turn into its opposite A small expression of favor 
the laborer would be able to get through his head it would be 
understood in the markettown by the highly respected cultured 
public by all balladmongers in short by the  times  
persons who dwelt in that markettown which with respect to its 
population was even a very big city but with respect to possessing 
understanding of and sense for the extraordinary was a very small 
markettown  but this thing of becoming the Emperors soninlaw 
was far too much And suppose now that this was not an external 
reality but an inward thing so that factual proofs could not help the 
laborer to certitude but faith itself was the facticity and so it was all 
left to faith whether he possessed humble courage enough to dare to 
believe it for impudent courage cannot help one to believe how 
many laboring men were there likely to be who possessed this courage 
But he who had not this courage would be offended the extraordinary 
would seem to him almost like mockery of him He would then perhaps 

 



honestly and plainly admit Such a thing is too high for me I cannot 
get it into my head it seems to me if I may blurt it straight out 
foolishness 

And now for Christianity Christianity teaches that this particular 
individual and so every individual whatever in other respects this 
individual may be man woman servingmaid minister of state 
merchant barber student etc  this individual exists before God  
this individual who perhaps would be vain for having once in his life 
talked with the King this man who is not a little proud of living on 
intimate terms with that person or the other this man exists before 
God can talk with God any moment he will sure to be heard by Him 
in short this man is invited to live on the most intimate terms with 
God Furthermore for this mans sake God came to the world let 
himself be born suffers and dies and this suffering God almost begs 
and entreats this man to accept the help which is offered him Verily if 
there is anything that would make a man lose his understanding it is 
surely this Whosoever has not the humble courage to dare to believe 
it must be offended at it But why is he offended Because it is too 
high for him because he cannot get it into his head because in the 
face of it he cannot acquire frankheartedness and therefore must 
have it done away with brought to naught and nonsense for it is as 
though it would stifle him 

For what is offense Offense is unhappy admiration It is therefore akin 
to envy but it is an envy which is turned against oneself or more 
exactly envy which is worst of all against oneself The narrow
mindedness of the natural man cannot welcome for itself the 
extraordinary which God has intended for him so he is offended 

 



The degree of the offense depends upon what passion a man has for 
admiration The more prosaic men devoid of imagination and passion 
and who therefore are not apt to admire they too may be offended 
but they confine themselves to saying Such a thing I cant get 
through my head I let it alone These are the skeptics But the more 
passion and imagination a man has the nearer consequently he is in a 
certain sense that is in possibility to being able to become a believer 
 nota bene by adoringly humbling himself under the extraordinary 
 all the more passionate is the offense which at last cannot be 
contented with less than getting this thing rooted out annihilated and 
trodden in the dust 

If one would learn to understand offense let him study human envy a 
subject which I offer as an extra course pluming myself upon having 
studied it profoundly Envy is concealed admiration An admirer who 
feels that he cannot be happy by surrendering himself elects to become 
envious of that which he admires So he speaks another language and 
in that language of his the thing which he really admires is called a 
stupid insipid and queer sort of thing Admiration is happy self
surrender envy is unhappy selfassertion 

So also it is with offense that which in the relation between man and 
man is known as admirationenvy in the relation between man and 
God is adorationoffense The summa summarum of all human wisdom 
is this golden or perhaps more properly the gilded ne quid nimis 
nothing to excess too much or too little spoils the broth This is 
given and taken between man and man as wisdom and is honored by 
admiration its quotation never fluctuates the whole of humanity 
guarantees its value So if once in a while there lives a genius who goes 
a little bit beyond it he is declared mad    by the wise But 

 



Christianity takes a prodigious giantstride beyond this ne quid nimis a 
stride into the absurd  there Christianity begins    and the offense 

One sees now how extraordinarily that there might be something 
extraordinary left  how extraordinarily stupid it is to defend 
Christianity how little knowledge of men this betrays and how truly 
even though it be unconsciously it is working in collusion with the 
enemy by making of Christianity a miserable something or another 
which in the end has to be rescued by a defense Therefore it is certain 
and true that he who first invented the notion of defending 
Christianity in Christendom is de facto Judas No  he also betrays 
with a kiss only his treachery is that of stupidity To defend anything 
is always to discredit it Let a man have a storehouse full of gold let 
him be willing to dispense every ducat to the poor  but let him 
besides that be stupid enough to begin this benevolent undertaking 
with a defense in which he advances three reasons to prove that it is 
justifiable  and people will be almost inclined to doubt whether he is 
doing any good But now for Christianity Yea he who defends it has 
never believed in it If he believes then the enthusiasm of faith is    
not defense no it is attack and victory The believer is a victor 

Thus it stands with Christianity and the offense The possibility of the 
offense is quite rightly included in the Christian definition of sin  in 
this phrase before God A pagan the natural man is very willing to 
admit that sin exists but this before God which really is what makes 
sin to be sin is for him too much it seems to him though in a 
different sense from that pointed out here to make too much of what 
it is to be a man a little less and then he is willing to agree to it  
but too much is too much 

 



 The Socratic Definition of Sin 

Sin is ignorance This is the wellknown Socratic definition of sin 
which like everything Socratic is an opinion always worthy of 
attention However with respect to this Socratic position as with 
respect to many other Socratic positions how many men have felt a 
need of going further What an innumerable number have felt the 
need of going further than the Socratic ignorance  presumably 
because they felt that it was impossible for them to stay there for in 
every generation how many men are there that are capable even for 
only a month of enduring and existentially expressing ignorance about 
everything 

Therefore I do not by any means intend to dispose of the Socratic 
definition on the ground that one cannot stop with it but having the 
Christian definition in mente in mind I would make use of it to bring 
the other out sharply just because the Socratic definition is so 
genuinely Greek so that here as always the hollowness of every other 
definition which is not in the strictest sense Christian that is of every 
partial definition may become manifest 

The difficulty with the Socratic definition is that it leaves undetermined 
how ignorance itself is to be more precisely understood the question 
of its origin etc That is to say even if sin be ignorance or what 
Christianity would perhaps prefer to call stupidity which in one sense 
cannot be denied we have to ask is this an original ignorance is it 
always the case that one has not known and hitherto could not know 
anything about the truth or is it a superinduced a subsequent 
ignorance If it is what the last question implies then sin must 
properly have its ground in something else it must have its ground in 

 



the activity with which a man has labored to obscure his intelligence 
But also when this is assumed the stiffnecked and toughlived 
difficulty returns prompting the question whether at the instant a man 
began to obscure his intelligence he was distinctly conscious of what 
he was doing If he was not distinctly conscious of this then his 
intelligence was already somewhat obscured before he began and the 
question merely returns again If it is assumed on the contrary that 
when he began to obscure his intelligence he was distinctly conscious 
of it then sin even though it be unconsciousness seeing that this was 
an induced state would not lie in the intelligence but in the will and 
the question which must be raised is about the relation of the 
intelligence and the will to one another With such questions as these 
and one might continue to augment them for many a day the 
Socratic definition does not deal Socrates was certainly an ethical 
teacher the Classical age claims him absolutely as the discoverer of 
ethics he was the first one as he is and remains the first in his class 
but he begins with ignorance Intellectually it is toward ignorance he 
tends toward the position of knowing nothing Ethically he 
understands by ignorance quite a different thing and so he begins 
with that 

But on the other hand as a matter of course Socrates is not an 
essentially religious ethicist still less a dogmatic one as the Christian 
ethicist is Hence he does not really enter into the whole investigation 
with which Christianity begins into the prius before in which sin 
presupposes itself and which is Christianly explained by the doctrine of 
original sin  a dogma to the border of which only we come in this 
investigation 

 



Socrates therefore never really gets to the determinant we know as sin 
which is surely a defect in a definition of sin Why is this For if sin is 
indeed ignorance then sin properly does not exist since sin is 
definitely consciousness If sin consists in being ignorant of what is 
right so that one consequently does what is wrong sin does not exist 
If this is sin then it must be assumed as Socrates also assumed that 
the case does not occur of a man knowing what is right and doing 
what is wrong or knowing that a thing is wrong and doing the wrong 
So then if the Socratic definition is correct sin does not exist But lo 
precisely this is Christianity understood just as it should be in a 
deeper sense it is quite correct in the interest of Christianity it is quod 
erat demonstrandum Precisely the concept by which Christianity 
distinguishes itself qualitatively and most decisively from paganism is 
the concept of sin the doctrine of sin and therefore Christianity also 
assumes quite consistently that neither paganism nor the natural man 
knows what sin is yea it assumes that there must be a revelation from 
God to make manifest what sin is For it is not true as a superficial 
view assumes that the doctrine of the atonement is the qualitative 
difference between paganism and Christianity No the beginning must 
be made far deeper with sin with the doctrine of sin as Christianity 
also does What a dangerous objection therefore against Christianity if 
paganism had a definition of sin which Christianity must admit is 
correct 

What determinant is it then that Socrates lacks in determining what sin 
is It is will defiant will The Greek intellectualism was too happy too 
naive too aesthetic too ironical too witty    too sinful to be able to 
get it into its head that a person knowingly could fail to do the good 

 



or knowingly with knowledge of what was right do what was wrong 
The Greek spirit proposes an intellectual categorical imperative 

The truth in this definition must by no means be overlooked and it 
needs to be enforced in times such as these which have gone astray in 
so much flatulent and unfruitful knowledge so that doubtless now 
just as in Socrates age only much more it is advisable that people 
should be starved a little bit Socratically It is enough to provoke both 
laughter and tears  not only all these protestations about having 
understood and comprehended the highest thought but also the 
virtuosity with which many know how to present it in abstracto and in 
a certain sense quite correctly  it is enough to provoke both laughter 
and tears when one sees then that all this knowing and understanding 
exercises no influence upon the lives of these men that their lives do 
not in the remotest way express what they have understood but rather 
the contrary One involuntarily exclaims at the sight of a disproportion 
at once so sorrowful and so ludicrous But how in the world is it 
possible that they have understood it And is it true that they have 
understood Here the ancient ironist and ethicist makes answer My 
dear man never believe it for if they truly had understood their lives 
also would have expressed it they would have done what they 
understood 

To understandand to understand are therefore two things Certainly 
they are and he who has understood this but not be it noted in the 
sense of the first sort of understanding is initiated into all the secret 
mysteries of irony It is with this contradiction irony is properly 
employed To perceive the comic in the fact that a person is actually 
ignorant of something means a very low sort of comic beneath the 
dignity of irony There is properly no profound comic in the fact that 

 



people once lived who assumed that the earth stands still  when 
nobody knew any better The same thing will presumably befall our 
age in contrast with an age which knows more of physical law The 
contradiction is one between two different ages there is lacking a 
deeper point of coincidence such a contradiction is not essential and 
hence neither is it essentially comic No but that a man stands up and 
says the right thing    and so has understood it and then when he 
has to act does the wrong thing    and so shows that he has not 
understood it  yes that is comic It is infinitely comic that a man 
moved unto tears so much moved that not only tears but sweat trickle 
from him can sit and read or hear representations of selfdenial of 
the nobility of sacrificing ones life for the truth  and then the next 
instant  one two three slapdash almost with the tears still in his 
eyes  is in full swing in the sweat of his brow with all his might and 
main helping falsehood to conquer It is infinitely comic that an 
orator with truth in his voice and in the expression of his features 
profoundly touched and profoundly touching can present the truth in 
a heartrending way can tread all evil and all the powers of hell under 
his feet with an aplomb in his attitude an assurance in his glance a 
resoluteness in his step which is altogether admirable  it is infinitely 
comic that almost at the same moment almost with his dressing
gown still on he can run cowardly and timidly out of the way of the 
least inconvenience It is infinitely comic that a man can understand 
the whole truth about how wretched and petty this world is etc  
that he can understand this and then cannot recognize again what he 
understood for almost in the same moment he himself goes off and 
takes part in the same pettiness and wretchedness takes glory in it and 
receives glory from it that is accepts it O when one beholds a man 
who protests that he has entirely understood how Christ went about in 

 



the form of a lowly servant poor despised and as the Scripture says 
spat upon  when I see the same man so careful to betake himself 
thither where in a worldly sense it is good to be and accommodate 
himself there in the utmost security when I see him apprehensive of 
every puff of wind from right or left as though his life depended upon 
it and so blissful so utterly blissful so awfully glad  yes to make the 
thing complete so awfully glad that he is able to thank God for it  
glad that he is held in honor by all men  then I have often said to 
myself and by myself Socrates Socrates Socrates can it be possible 
that this man has understood what he says he has understood So I 
have said and at the same time I have wished that Socrates might be 
right For it seemed to me after all as though Christianity were too 
severe nor can I bring it into accord with my experience to treat such a 
man as a hypocrite No Socrates thee I can understand thou dost 
treat him as a wag as a sort of merry Andrew thou dost treat him as a 
butt for laughter thou hast no objection it has even thine approval 
that I prepare and serve him up as a comic dish  provided I do it well 

Socrates Socrates Socrates Yes one may well call thy name thrice it 
would not be too much to call it ten times if that would do any good 
People think that the world needs a republic and they think that it 
needs a new social order and a new religion  but it never occurs to 
anybody that what the world now needs confused as it is by much 
knowing is a Socrates But that is perfectly natural for if anybody had 
this notion not to say if many were to have it there would be less 
need of a Socrates What a delusion most needs is the very thing it 
least thinks of  naturally for otherwise it would not be a delusion 

So then such an ironicethical correction might very well be what our 
age needs and perhaps the only thing it really needs for it is evident 

 



that this is the thing it least thinks of It is highly important that 
instead of going further than Socrates we simply return to the Socratic 
dictum that to understandand to understand are two things  not 
returning to it as a result once for all acquired for in the end that 
only helps men into the deepest wretchedness since it simply abolishes 
the distinction between understandingand understanding but 
returning to it as the ethical interpretation of everyday life 

The Socratic definition helps itself out as follows When a person 
doesnt do the right thing why then neither has he understood it his 
understanding is a vain conceit his assertion that he has understood it 
is a false indication of the way his repeated assertion that the devil 
take him if he has not understood it is a prodigious remoteness along 
the greatest possible detour But then indeed the definition is correct 
If a man does the right thing then surely he doesnt sin and if he 
doesnt do the right thing then neither has he understood it if in 
truth he had understood it this would at once have moved him to do 
it would at once make him an echo of his understanding  ergo sin is 
ignorance 

But where does the difficulty lie It is to be ascribed to a fact of which 
the Socratic view itself was aware though only to a certain degree and 
sought to remedy that it lacks a dialectical determinant for the 
transition from having understood something to the doing of it In this 
transition Christianity makes its start by proceeding along this path it 
proves that sin lies in the will thus attaining the concept of defiance 
and then in order to make the end thoroughly fast it adjoins to this 
the dogma of original sin  for alas the secret of Speculations 
success in comprehending is just this of sewing without making the 
end fast and without knotting the thread and therefore it can 

 



marvelously keep on sewing ie keep on pulling the end through 
Christianity on the contrary fastens the end by means of the paradox 

In pure ideality where there is no question of the real individual man 
the transition is accomplished by necessity in the System indeed 
everything comes about by necessity in other words there is no 
difficulty at all connected with the transition from understanding to 
doing This is purely in the Greek spirit  yet not Socratic for Socrates 
was too much of an ethicist for that And quite the same thing is really 
the secret of the whole of recent philosophy cogito ergo sum to think 
is to be The Christian motto on the contrary is As thou believest so 
it comes to pass or As thou believest so art thou to believe is to be 
So one can see that modern philosophy is neither more nor less than 
paganism But this is not the worst to be akin to Socrates is not the 
meanest position But the entirely unsocratic trait of modern 
philosophy is that it wants to make itself and us believe that it is 
Christianity 

In the world of reality on the other hand where it is a question of the 
individual man there is this little tiny transition from having 
understood to doing it is not always cito citissime as quickly as 
possible not geschwind wie der Wind fast as the wind if I may speak 
German for lack of philosophic terms On the contrary here begins a 
very prolix story 

In the life of spirit on the other hand there is no stopping Stilstand 
nor in reality is there any condition Tilstand everything is actuality 
in case then a man the very same second he has known what is right 
does not do it  well then first of all the knowledge stops boiling 
And next comes the question how the will likes this thing that is 

 



known If it does not like it it does not follow that the will goes ahead 
and does the opposite of that which the intelligence understood such 
strong contrasts occur doubtless rather seldom but the will lets some 
time pass there is an interim that means Well see about that 
tomorrow All this while the intelligence becomes more and more 
obscured and the lower nature triumphs more and more For alas the 
good must be done at once  at once the moment it is known and 
hence the transition goes so easily in the pure ideality where everything 
is at once but the strength of the lower nature consists in dragging 
a thing out The will has no particular objection to it  so it says with 
its fingers crossed And then when the intelligence has become duly 
darkened the intelligence and the will can understand one another 
better at last they agree entirely for now the intelligence has gone 
over to the side of the will and acknowledges that the thing is quite 
right as it would have it And so there live perhaps a great multitude of 
men who labor off and on to obscure their ethical and religious 
understanding which would lead them out into decisions and 
consequences which the lower nature does not love extending 
meanwhile their aesthetic and metaphysical understanding which 
ethically is a distraction 

However with all this we have not yet got any further than the 
Socratic position for as Socrates would say if this comes about then 
it only shows that such a man had not understood what is right That 
is to say the Greek spirit had not the courage to assert that a man 
knowingly does what is wrong with knowledge of the right does what 
is wrong so Socrates comes to its aid and says When a man does 
wrong he has not understood what is right 

 



Quite correct and further than that no man can go no man by himself 
and of himself can explain what sin is precisely because he is in sin All 
his talk about sin is at bottom palliation for sin an excuse a sinful 
mitigation Hence Christianity begins also in another way by declaring 
that there must be a revelation from God in order to instruct man as to 
what sin is that sin does not consist in the fact that man has not 
understood what is right but in the fact that he will not understand it 
and in the fact that he will not do it 

With respect to the distinction between not being able to 
understandand not being willing to understand even Socrates 
furnishes no real enlightenment whereas he is Grand Master above all 
ironists in operating by means of the distinction between 
understandingand understanding Socrates explains that he who does 
not do the right thing has not understood it but Christianity goes a 
little further back and says it is because he will not understand it and 
this in turn is because he does not will the right And in the next place 
describing what properly is defiance it teaches that a man does wrong 
although he understands what is right or forbears to do right although 
he understands what is right in short the Christian doctrine of sin is 
pure impertinence against man accusation upon accusation it is the 
charge which the Deity as prosecutor takes the liberty of lodging 
against man 

But can anyone comprehend this Christian doctrine By no means  
this too is Christian and so is an offense It must be believed 
Comprehension is conterminous with mans relation to the human but 
faith is mans relation to the divine How then does Christianity explain 
this incomprehensible Quite consistently in an equally 
incomprehensible way by means of the fact that it is revealed 

 



So then Christianly understood sin lies in the will not in the intellect 
and this corruption of the will goes well beyond the consciousness of 
the individual This is the perfectly consistent declaration for otherwise 
the question how sin began must arise with respect to each individual 

Here again we have the criterion of the offense The possibility of the 
offense consists in the fact that there has to be a revelation from God 
to enlighten man as to what sin is and how deep it lies The natural 
man the pagan thinks thus O well I admit that I have not 
understood everything in heaven and earth if there is to be a 
revelation let it inform us about the heavenly but that there should be 
a revelation to explain what sin is that is the most preposterous thing 
of all I dont pretend to be a perfect man far from it but I know and I 
am willing to concede how far I am from perfection  ought I not 
then to know what sin is But Christianity makes answer No that is 
what you know least about how far you are from perfection and what 
sin is Behold in this sense in a Christian sense sin doubtless is 
ignorance it is ignorance of what sin is 

The definition of sin which was given in the preceding chapter 
therefore still needs to be completed sin is after having been informed 
by a revelation from God what sin is then before God in despair not to 
will to be oneself or before God in despair to will to be oneself 

 Sin Is Not a Negation but a Position 

For the truth of this affirmation the orthodox dogmatic as a whole has 
constantly contended and it has rejected as pantheistic every definition 
of sin which makes it something negative  weakness sensuality 
finiteness ignorance etc Orthodoxy has perceived very rightly that 

 



here is where the battle has to be fought or to recall the foregoing 
that it is here the end must be made fast that here is the place to put 
up resistance Orthodoxy has rightly perceived that if sin is defined 
negatively all of Christianity totters Therefore orthodoxy insists that 
there must be a revelation from God in order to teach fallen men what 
sin is a revelation which quite consistently must be believed since it 
is a dogma And naturally paradox faith dogma these three 
determinants form an alliance and accord which is the firmest support 
and bulwark against pagan wisdom 

So it is with orthodoxy By a strange misunderstanding a socalled 
speculative dogmatic which certainly  has suspicious dealings with 
philosophy has entertained the notion that it is able to comprehend 
this definition of sin as a position But if this is true then sin is a 
negation The secret of all comprehending is that the very act of 
comprehension is higher than every position which it posits The 
concept posits a position but the fact that it is comprehended means 
precisely that it is negated The speculative dogmatic being itself 
aware of this to a certain degree has known no other way to help itself 
but by the maneuver not very seemly in a philosophic science of 
throwing out a detachment of asseverations at the point where a 
movement is being made One asseverates each time more solemnly 
than the last and with more and more oaths and curses that sin is a 
position that to say that it is merely a negation is pantheism and 
rationalism and God knows what all but altogether something which 
the speculative dogmatic renunciates and abhors  and then one goes 
on to comprehend what it means that sin is a position That is to say 
that after all it is a position only up to a certain degree not any more 
so than that one can after all comprehend it 

 



And the same duplicity of speculation is manifested also at another 
point which is however related to the same subject The 
interpretation of sin or the way sin is defined is decisive for the 
interpretation of repentance Then since this thing of negating a 
negation is so speculative there is nothing else to be done repentance 
must be a negation of the negation  and so sin becomes the 
negation 

However it is certainly very much to be desired that a sober thinker 
would for once explain how far this purely logical process which 
recalls the grammatical rule that two negatives make an affirmative 
and the mathematical rule that two minuses are a plus  how far I 
say this logical process is valid in the world of reality in the world of 
qualities whether after all the qualities are not subject to a different 
dialectic whether in this case transition does not play a different 
rle Sub specie aetemi aeterno modo etc the element of time is 
lacking in which things can be spaced out hence everything is and 
there is no transition at all In this abstract medium to posit is eo ipso 
the same thing as to cancel or resolve But to regard reality in the 
same way is pretty close to madness One can say also in abstracto that 
the perfect tense follows the imperfect But if in the world of reality a 
man were to infer that it followed by itself and followed at once that a 
work he had not completed the imperfect became complete the 
perfect  he surely would be crazy But so it is too with the socalled 
position of sin when the medium in which it is posited is pure 
thinking that medium is far too unstable to insure that this assertion 
that sin is a position can be taken seriously 

However all such questions are aside from the issue which immediately 
concerns me here I am merely keeping a steady hold upon the 

 



Christian dogma that sin is a position  not however as though it 
could be comprehended but as a paradox which must be believed To 
my way of thinking this is the correct thing If only one can get it 
made manifest that all attempts at comprehending are self
contradictory then the thing assumes the correct position and then it 
becomes clear that it must be left to faith whether one will believe or 
not 

I can well comprehend this being not too divine a matter to be 
comprehended that one who just simply has to comprehend and only 
can think of such matters as offer themselves to comprehension may 
find this material very scanty But in case the whole of Christianity 
hinges upon this that it must be believed not comprehended that it 
either must be believed or one must be offended at it  is it then so 
meritorious to be determined to comprehend it Is it meritorious or is 
it not rather insolence or thoughtlessness to will to comprehend that 
which is not willing to be comprehended When a King takes the 
notion of wishing to be entirely incognito to be treated in all respects 
as a simple man is it then just because in general it seems to men a 
greater distinction to do him royal homage is it then the correct thing 
to do it Or is it not precisely to assert oneself and ones own way of 
thinking directly in opposition to the Kings will Is it not to do as one 
willfully prefers to do instead of deferring to the Kings will Or would 
it I wonder give pleasure to the King in proportion as such a man was 
more ingenious in displaying toward him the proper reverence of a 
subject when the King does not wish to be treated in that way  that 
is to say the more ingenious such a man might be in acting contrary 
to the Kings will 

 



So let others admire and extol him who claims to be able to 
comprehend Christianity  I regard it as a plain ethical duty which 
perhaps demands no little selfdenial in such speculative times when all 
the others are busy about comprehending  I regard it then as a 
plain duty to admit that one neither can nor shall comprehend it Just 
this however is doubtless what the age what Christendom needs 
namely a little Socratic ignorance in relation to Christianity  but I say 
emphatically Socratic ignorance Let us never forget yet after all how 
many are there that ever have known it or thought of it  let us 
never forget that the ignorance of Socrates was a kind of godly fear 
and divine worship that his ignorance was the Greek rendering of the 
Jewish perception that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom Let 
us never forget that precisely out of reverence for the Deity he was 
ignorant that so far as a pagan could be he kept watch as a judge on 
the border between Godand man watching out to see that the deep 
gulf of qualitative distinction be firmly fixed between them between 
Godand man that Godand man may not in a way philosophice 
poetice etc coalesce into one Lo for this reason Socrates was the 
ignorant man and for this reason the Deity recognized  him as the 
most knowing  But Christianity teaches that everything Christian 
exists only for faith for this reason precisely it wills to be a Socratic a 
Godfearing ignorance which by ignorance defends faith against 
speculation keeping watch to see that the deep gulf of qualitative 
distinction between Godand man may be firmly fixed as it is in the 
paradox and in faith lest Godand man still more dreadfully than ever 
it occurred in paganism might in a way philosophice poetice etc 
coalesce into one    in the System 

 



Only from one side can there be any question here of illuminating the 
fact that sin is a position In the foregoing description of despair 
attention was constantly directed to an ascending scale The expression 
for the scale was in part potentiation of consciousness of the self in 
part potentiation as from passive suffering to conscious action Both 
expressions in combination are in turn the expression for the fact that 
despair does not come from without but from within And in the same 
degree despair is more and more positive ponerende But according to 
the definition of sin we have formulated a constituent of sin is the self 
as infinitely potentiated by the conception of God and thus in turn it 
is the greatest possible consciousness of sin as a deed This is the 
expression for the fact that sin is a position the positive factor in it is 
precisely this that it is before God 

Moreover the determination of sin as a position involves also in an 
entirely different sense the possibility of offense the paradox For the 
paradox results from the doctrine of the atonement First Christianity 
goes ahead and establishes sin so securely as a position that the human 
understanding never can comprehend it and then it is the same 
Christian doctrine which in turn undertakes to do away with this 
position so completely that the human understanding never can 
comprehend it Speculation which chatters itself away from the 
paradoxes lops a little bit off at both ends and so it goes easier it 
does not make sin so entirely positive  and in spite of this it cannot 
get it through its head that sin should be entirely forgotten But 
Christianity which is the first discoverer of the paradoxes is in this 
case also as paradoxical as possible it works directly against itself 
when it establishes sin so securely as a position that it seems a perfect 
impossibility to do away with it again  and then it is precisely 

 



Christianity which by the atonement would do away with it so 
completely that it is as though drowned in the sea 

Appendix to I  

But Then in a Certain Sense Does Not Sin Become a Great Rarity 
The Moral 

It was remarked in Part First that the more intense despair becomes 
the more rare it is in the world But now as we have seen sin is that 
despair which has been still further potentiated and qualitatively 
potentiated and so this surely must be exceedingly rare Marvelous 
objection Christianity has concluded all under sin we have endeavored 
to represent the Christian position as rigorously as possible  and from 
this results the strange conclusion that sin is not to be found at all in 
paganism but only in Judaism and Christianity and there again only 
very rarely 

And yet this is but only in one sense perfectly correct After having 
been informed by a revelation from God what sin is then before God 
in despair not to will to be oneself or before God in despair to will to 
be oneself is to sin  and certainly it is rare for a man to be so 
developed so transparent to himself that this can fit his case But 
what logically follows from this Yea one may well take heed of this 
for here there is a peculiar dialectical turn From the fact that a man is 
not in a more intense despair it did not follow that he is not in despair 
On the contrary it was proved precisely that most men by far the 
majority of men are in despair despair in a lower form There is no 
merit in being in despair in a higher degree Aesthetically it is an 
advantage for aesthetically one has regard merely to strength but 

 



ethically the more intense kind of despair is further from salvation than 
is the lower 

And so it is also in the case of sin The lives of most men being 
determined by a dialectic of indifference are so remote from the good 
faith that they are almost too spiritless to be called sin yes almost 
too spiritless to be called despair 

To be in the strictest sense a sinner is again very far from being 
meritorious But then on the other hand how on earth can one expect 
to find an essential consciousness of sin and after all that is what 
Christianity wants in a life which is so retarded by triviality by a 
chattering imitation of the others that one hardly can call it sin that 
it is too spiritless to be so called and fit only as the Scripture says to 
be spewed out 

But this is not the end of the matter for the dialectic of sin merely 
catches one in another way For how does it come about that a mans 
life becomes so spiritless that it is as if Christianity could not be 
brought into relation to it as when a jackscrew and like a jackscrew 
is the uplifting power of Christianity cannot be employed because 
there is no solid ground but only moss and bog Is this something that 
befalls a man No it is mans own fault No man is born with 
spiritlessness and however many there be who in death bring with 
them this as the only acquisition of their lives  this is not the fault of 
life 

But it must be said and as outspokenly as possible that the socalled 
Christendom in which after a sort all men are Christians in a way so 
that there are just as many precisely as many Christians as there are 

 



men   it must be said that not only is it a wretched edition of 
Christianity full of misprints disturbing to the sense and of senseless 
omissions and additions but that it has abusively taken Christianitys 
name in vain In a small country there are born hardly three poets in 
every generation but of priests there are a plenty many more than can 
get appointments With regard to a poet people speak of his having a 
call but as for becoming a priest it seems enough to the generality of 
men and that means of Christians that one has taken an examination 
And yet alas a true priest is even more rare than a true poet and the 
word call originally was used in a religious sense But with respect to 
being a poet people still retain a notion that it is something and that 
there is something in it that a man is called On the other hand to be a 
priest is in the eyes of the generality of men and so also of Christians 
a thing bereft of every uplifting conception lacking the least trace of 
the mysterious in puns naturalibus ie without mincing words it is a 
career Call means a benefice people talk about getting a call but 
about having a call  O yes they talk about being called for trumps 

And alas the fate of this word in Christendom is like a motto for 
Christianity as a whole The misfortune is not that Christian truth is 
never uttered just as it is not the misfortune that there are not priests 
enough but that it is uttered in such a way that at last the generality 
of men attach to it no significance whatever just as the generality of 
men attach to being a priest no other significance than that which 
goes with the weekday occupations of a merchant attorney book
binder veterinary etc so that the highest things make no impression 
at all but sound out and are heard as something which somehow God 
knows how has become use and wont like so many other things What 

 



wonder then that certain people instead of finding their own conduct 
indefensible find it incumbent upon them to defend Christianity 

After all a priest surely ought to be a believer And think what a 
believer is A believer is surely a lover yea of all lovers the most in 
love With respect to enthusiasm a lover is after all only a stripling in 
comparison with a believer Think now of a lover He would be capable 
would he not day in and day out as long as it was day and well into 
the night of talking about his love But dost thou believe it could 
occur to him dost thou believe it would be possible for him dost thou 
not believe that it would be an abomination to him to talk in such a 
way as to try to prove by three reasons that there is after all something 
in this thing of being in love  pretty much as when the parson 
proves by three reasons that it is profitable to pray so that this thing 
of prayer has sunk so low in price that there must be three reasons 
alleged to bring it a little bit into repute Or as when the parson and 
this is the same thing only still more laughable proves by three 
reasons that to pray is a bliss surpassing all understanding Oh 
priceless anticlimax The fact that something surpasses all 
understanding is proved by three    reasons which whatever else 
they may be good for surely do not surpass the understanding but 
precisely on the contrary make it evident to the understanding that this 
bliss does not surpass the understanding for after all reasons certainly 
lie within the compass of the understanding No for that which 
surpasses the understanding and for him who believes in it the three 
reasons signify no more than three bottles or three red deer  And 
now further Dost thou believe it would occur to a lover to put up a 
defense for his love that is to admit that to him it was not the 
absolute unconditionally the absolute but that he thinks this thought 

 



of love along with objections against it and from this proceeds the 
defense that is to say dost thou believe that he could or would 
concede that he was not in love denounce himself as not being a 
lover And in case a man were to propose to a lover to talk thus dost 
thou not believe that he would regard that man as mad And in case 
besides being in love he was something of an observer dost thou not 
believe that he would suspect that the man who made to him this 
proposal had never known what it is to be in love or would like to get 
him to betray and deny his love    by defending it  Is it not 
evident that it could never occur to one who really is in love to want to 
prove it by three reasons or to defend it For in fact he himself is that 
which is more than all reasons and more than every defense  he is a 
lover And he who does this is not in love he merely gives himself out 
udgiver to be that and unfortunately  or fortunately  he does it 
so stupidly that he merely denounces angiver himself as one who is 
not in love 

But this is just the way Christianity is talked about    by believing 
priests They either defend Christianity or they translate it into 
reasons  if they are not at the same time dabbling in 
comprehending it speculatively This is what is called preaching and 
it is regarded in Christendom as already a big thing that such preaching 
is done and that some hear it And it is precisely for this reason that 
Christendom here is the proof of it is so far from being what it calls 
itself that the lives of most men are Christianly understood too 
spiritless even to be called in a strictly Christian sense sin 

 



Chapter  Continuation of Sin  

 

Every state or condition in sin is new sin or as it might be more 
exactly expressed and as it will be expressed in the following the state 
of being in sin is the new sin is emphatically the sin This seems 
perhaps to the sinner an exaggeration he at the most recognizes every 
actual sin as a new sin But eternity which keeps his accounts must 
register the state of being in sin as a new sin It has only two rubrics 
and everything which is not of faith is sin every unrepented sin is a 
new sin and every moment it is unrepented is new sin But how rare is 
the man who possesses continuity with respect to his consciousness of 
himself Generally men are only momentarily conscious conscious in 
the great decisions but the daily things are not computed at all such 
men are spirit if this word may be applied to them once a week for 
one hour  of course that is a pretty bestial way of being spirit 
Eternity however is essential continuity and requires this of man or 
requires that he shall be conscious of himself as spirit and shall have 
faith The sinner on the other hand is so thoroughly in the power of sin 
that he has no conception of its totalitarian character or that he is in 
the byway of perdition He takes into account only each individual new 
sin by which he acquires new headway onward along the path of 
perdition just as if the previous instant he were not going with the 
speed of the previous sins along that same path So natural has sin 
become to him or sin has so become his second nature that he finds 
the daily continuance quite a matter of course and it is only when by 
a new sin he acquires as it were new headway that for an instant he is 
made aware By perdition he is blinded to the fact that his life instead 

 



of possessing the essential continuity of the eternal by being before 
God in faith has the continuity of sin 

But The continuity of sin Is not sin precisely the discontinuous Lo 
here we have again the notion that sin is merely a negation to which 
one can acquire no title as one can acquire no title to stolen property 
a negation an impotent attempt to give itself consistency which 
nevertheless suffering as it does from the torture of impotence in the 
defiance of despair it is not able to do Yes so it is speculatively but 
Christianly sin is and this has to be believed it is indeed the paradox 
which no man can comprehend  sin is a position which out of itself 
develops a more and more positive ponerende continuity 

And the law for the growth of this continuity is moreover different 
from the law which applies to a debt or to a negation For a debt does 
not grow because it is not paid it grows every time it is added to But 
sin grows every instant one does not get out of it It is as far as 
possible from being true that the sinner is right in only regarding every 
new sin as an increase of sin  so far from being true that Christianly 
understood the state of remaining in sin is really a greater sin We 
have even a proverb which says that to sin is human but to remain in 
sin is devilish But Christianly this proverb must be understood in a 
rather different sense The merely desultory way of conceiving the case 
which has regard only to the new sin and passes over the intermediate 
state the interval between the particular sins is just as superficial a 
way of conceiving it as it would be to assume that the railway train 
moved only when the locomotive puffed No this puffing and the 
onrush which succeeds it is really not the thing that has to be 
considered but rather the even momentum with which the locomotive 
proceeds and which occasions the puffing And so it is with sin The 

 



state of remaining in sin is in the deepest sense sin the particular sins 
are not the continuation of sin but they are the expression for the 
continuation of sin in the particular new sins the momentum of sin 
merely becomes more observable 

The state of being in sin is a worse sin than the particular sins it is the 
sin emphatically and thus understood it is true that the state of 
remaining in sin is the continuation of sin is a new sin Generally one 
understands this differently one understands that the one sin gives 
birth to new sin But this has a far deeper ground for the fact that the 
state of being in sin is new sin Psychologically it is a masterly stroke of 
Shakespeare to let Macbeth say Act iii Scene  Sndentsprossne 
Werke erlangen nur durch Sinde Kraft und Strke That is to say sin is 
within itself a consistency and in this consistency of evil within itself it 
possesses a certain power But one never reaches such a point of view 
when one considers merely the particular sins 

Doubtless most men live with far too little consciousness of themselves 
to have a conception of what consistency is that is to say they do not 
exist qua spirit Their lives either with a certain childish and lovable 
navet or in sheer banality consist in some act or another some 
occurrence this or that and then they do something good then in 
turn something wrong and then it begins all over again now they are 
in despair for an afternoon perhaps for three weeks but then they are 
jovial again and then again they are a whole day in despair They take 
a hand in the game of life as it were but they never have the 
experience of staking all upon one throw never attain the conception 
of an infinite selfconsistency Therefore among themselves their talk is 
always about the particular particular deeds particular sins 

 



Every existence which is under the rubric of spirit even if it is such 
only on its own responsibility and at its own peril has essentially 
consistency within itself and consistency in something higher at least 
in an idea But again such an existence fears infinitely every 
inconsistency because it has an infinite conception of what the 
consequence may be that because of it one might be wrenched out of 
the totality in which one has ones life The least inconsistency is a 
prodigious loss for with that a man in fact loses consistency that 
same instant the charm is perhaps broken the mysterious power which 
bound all powers in harmony is enfeebled the spring loses its tension 
the whole machinery is a chaos where the forces fight in rebellion 
against one another to the injury of the self and therein there is no 
accord with oneself no momentum no impetus The prodigious 
machine which in consistency was so compliant with its iron strength 
so pliable with all its power is in disorder and the more excellent the 
machine was all the more frightful is the confusion  The believer 
who reposes in and has his strength in the consistency of the good has 
an infinite fear of even the least sin for he stands to lose infinitely 
The immediate men  the childlike or the childish  have no totality 
to lose they constantly lose and win only the particular thing and in 
the particular instance 

But as with the believer so it is also with his counterpart the 
demoniac man with respect to the consistency of sin in itself As the 
drunkard steadily keeps up the intoxication from day to day for fear of 
the languor which would ensue from arresting it and the possible 
consequences if for one day he were to remain entirely sober  so it is 
with the demoniac Yea just as the good man if one were to approach 
him temptingly picturing sin in one or another alluring form would 

 



bid him tempt me not so one has instances of exactly the same 
thing on the part of the demoniac Face to face with one who is 
stronger than he in the good the demoniac when one would picture 
to him the good in its blissful sublimity might beg for himself beg 
him with tears in his eyes that he would not talk to him would not as 
he expresses it make him weak Just because the demoniac is 
consistent in himself and in the consistency of evil just for this cause 
he also has a totality to lose A single instant outside of his 
consistency one single dietetic imprudence one single glance aside 
one instant when the whole thing or at least a part thereof is seen 
and understood in a different way  and with that he would never 
more be himself he says That is he has given up the good in despair 
it could not help him anyway he says but it well might disturb him 
make it impossible for him ever again to acquire the full momentum of 
consistency make him weak Only in the continuation of sin he is 
himself only in that does he live and have an impression of himself 
What does this mean It means that the state of being in sin is that 
which in the depth to which he has sunk holds him together 
impiously strengthening him by consistency it is not the particular 
new sin which crazy as it sounds to say it helps him but the 
particular new sin is merely the expression for the state of being in sin 
which properly is the sin 

By the continuation in sin which is the theme we now have to deal 
with we are to think not so much of the particular new sins as of the 
state of being in sin which in turn becomes the potentiation of sin in 
itself an abiding in the state of sin with consciousness thereof so that 
the law for the movement in potentiation is here as everywhere in the 
inward direction in more and more intense consciousness 

 



 The Sin of Despairing over Ones Sin 

Sin is despair the potentiation of this is the new sin of despairing over 
ones sin It can easily be seen moreover that this is characterized as 
potentiation It is not a new sin in the sense of repetition as in the 
case of a man who once stole  and another time steals  
No it is not a question of particular acts of sin the state of sin is sin 
and this is potentiated in a new consciousness 

Despairing over ones sin is the expression for the fact that sin has 
become or would become consistent in itself It will have nothing to do 
with the good will not be weak enough to harken once in a while to 
another sort of talk No it will hear only itself have to do only with 
itself shut itself in with itself yea enclose itself within one enclosure 
more and by despair over its sin secure itself against every assault of 
the good or every aspiration after it It is conscious of having cut the 
bridge behind it and so of being inaccessible to the good as the good 
is to it so that though in a weak moment it were to will the good this 
would nevertheless be impossible Sin itself is detachment from the 
good but despair over sin is a second detachment This of course 
tortures out of sin its utmost demoniac powers bestowing upon it the 
ungodly hardiness or obduracy which must constantly regard 
everything which is of the nature of repentance and everything which 
is of the nature of grace not only as empty and meaningless but as its 
foe as the thing which most of all it has to guard against quite in the 
same way as the good guards itself against temptation So understood 
it is rightly said by Mephistopheles in Faust that nothing is more 
miserable than a devil who despairs for by despairing must here be 
understood unwillingness to hear anything about repentance and 
grace To indicate the character of this potentiation from sin to despair 

 



over sin one might say that the former is the breach with the good the 
latter is the breach with repentance 

Despair over sin is an attempt to maintain oneself by sinking still 
deeper As one who ascends in a balloon rises by casting weights from 
him so does the despairing man sink by casting from him the good 
for the weight of the good is uplift he sinks doubtless he thinks he is 
rising  he does indeed become lighter Sin itself is the struggle of 
despair but then when strength is exhausted there must needs be a 
new potentiation a new demoniacal introversion and this is despair 
over ones sin This is a step in advance an ascent in the demoniacal 
but of course it means sinking deeper in sin It is an attempt to impart 
to sin as a positive power firmness and interest by the fact that now it 
is eternally decided that one will hear nothing about repentance 
nothing about grace Nevertheless despair over sin is conscious of its 
own emptiness conscious of the fact that it has nothing whatever to 
live on not even a lofty conception of ones own self Psychologically 
it is a masterly line Macbeth utters after the murder when he is in 
despair over his sin Act ii Scene  

For from this instant  
Theres nothing serious in mortality 
All is but toys renown and grace is dead 

The masterly double stroke is in the last words renown and grace By 
sin that is to say by despairing over his sin he has lost every relation 
to grace  and to himself at the same time His selfish self culminates 
in ambition Now he has indeed become king and yet by despairing 
over his sin and about the reality of repentance about grace he has 
also lost himself be cannot even maintain himself in his own eyes and 

 



he is precisely as far from being able to enjoy his own self in ambition 
as he is from grasping grace 

In real life in so far as despair over sin actually occurs in life  but 
there occurs at all events something they call such people generally 
have a mistaken notion of despair over sin presumably because in the 
world one generally has to do with levity thoughtlessness and pure 
prattle and therefore becomes quite solemn and reverently lifts the hat 
before every expression of something deeper Either in confused 
obscurity about oneself and ones significance or with a trace of 
hypocrisy or by the help of cunning and sophistry which is present in 
all despair despair over sin is not indisposed to bestow upon itself the 
appearance of something good So it is supposed to be an expression 
for a deep nature which thus takes its sin so much to heart I will 
adduce an example When a man who has been addicted to one sin or 
another but then for a long while has withstood temptation and 
conquered  if he has a relapse and again succumbs to temptation 
the dejection which ensues is by no means always sorrow over sin It 
may be something else for the matter of that it may be exasperation 
against providence as if it were providence which had allowed him to 
fall into temptation as if it ought not to have been so hard on him 
since for a long while he had victoriously withstood temptation But at 
any rate it is womanish without more ado to regard this sorrow as 
good not to be in the least observant of the duplicity there is in all 
passionateness which in turn has this ominous consequence that at 
times the passionate man understands afterwards almost to the point 
of frenzy that he has said exactly the opposite of that which he meant 
to say Such a man asseverated with stronger and stronger expressions 
how much this relapse tortures and torments him how it brings him to 

 



despair I can never forgive myself for it he says And all this is 
supposed to be the expression for how much good there dwells within 
him what a deep nature he is In this representation I intentionally 
introduced the catchword I can never forgive myself for it precisely 
the word which is commonly used in such a connection And precisely 
by this catchword one can orient oneself dialectically He can never 
forgive himself for it  but now in case God would forgive him for it 
he might well have the kindness to forgive himself No his despair over 
sin and all the more the more it storms in the passion of expression 
whereby without being aware of it in the least he informs against 
himself when he never can forgive himself that he could sin thus for 
this sort of talk is pretty nearly the opposite of penitent contrition 
which prays God for forgiveness  this despair is far from being a 
characteristic of the good rather it is a more intensive characterization 
of sin the intensity of which is a deeper sinking into sin The fact is 
that during the time he victoriously withstood temptation he was in his 
own eyes better than he actually was he was proud of himself It is 
now in the interest of pride that the past should be something entirely 
left behind But in the relapse the past suddenly becomes again entirely 
present This reminder his pride cannot endure and hence the deep 
distress etc But the direction of this distress is evidently away from 
God manifesting a hidden selflove and pride  instead of humbly 
beginning by thanking God humbly for helping him so long to 
withstand temptation acknowledging before God and before himself 
that this after all is much more than he had deserved and so humbling 
himself under the remembrance of what he had been 

In this instance as usual the explanation given in the old works of 
edification is so profound so understanding so instructive They teach 

 



that God sometimes permits the believer to stumble and fall into one 
temptation or another  precisely to humble him and thereby confirm 
him the more in the good the contrast between the relapse and the 
perhaps considerable progress in the good is so humiliating the 
identity with himself so painful The better a man is the more 
dangerous in case he does not make the right turn is even the least 
little bit of impatience He may perhaps for sorrow sink into the darkest 
melancholy  and a fool of a pastor may not be far from admiring his 
deep soul and the power of good which is in him   as though this 
were the good And his wife yea she feels herself deeply humbled in 
comparison with such an earnest and holy man who can thus sorrow 
for his sin Perhaps his talk is still more deceptive he perhaps does not 
say I can never forgive myself for it as if before he had forgiven 
himself for his sins  a blasphemy no he talks about God never 
forgiving him for it And alas this is only a mystification His sorrow 
his concern his despair is selfish like the dread of sin which at times 
almost frightens a man into sin because it is selflove which would like 
to be proud of itself like to be without sin  and consolation is what 
he is least in need of wherefore also the prodigious quantity of 
consoling thoughts the physicians of the soul prescribe only make the 
sickness worse 

 The Sin of Despairing of Mark the distinction between 
despairing over ones sin and despairing of the forgiveness of sins 
the Forgiveness of Sins Offense  

The potentiation in consciousness of the self is in this instance 
knowledge of Christ being a self face to face with Christ First there 
came in Part First ignorance of having an eternal self then 
knowledge of having a self wherein there is after all something eternal 

 



Thereupon as a transition to Part Second it was shown that this 
distinction is referable to the self which has a human conception of 
itself or whose goal is man The contrast to this was a self face to face 
with God and this was taken as the basis of the definition of sin 

Now comes a self face to face with Christ  a self which nevertheless 
in despair will not be itself or in despair will be itself For despair of 
the forgiveness of sins must be related to one or the other formula of 
despair that of weakness or that of defiance that of weakness which 
being offended does not dare to believe or that of defiance which 
being offended will not believe Only in this case since here it is not a 
question about being oneself simply but about being oneself qua 
sinner consequently oneself as characterized by ones imperfection 
weakness and defiance are the converse of what they ordinarily are 
Ordinarily weakness is in despair not to will to be oneself Here this is 
defiance for here it is clearly defiance not to will to be the man one is 
a sinner and for this reason to will to dispense with the forgiveness of 
sins Ordinarily defiance is in despair to will to be oneself Here this is 
weakness in despair to will to be oneself a sinner in such wise that 
there is no forgiveness 

A self face to face with Christ is a self potentiated by the prodigious 
concession of God potentiated by the prodigious emphasis which falls 
upon it for the fact that God also for the sake of this self let Himself to 
be born became man suffered died As was said in the foregoing the 
more conception of God the more self so here it is true that the more 
conception of Christ the more self A self is qualitatively what its 
measure is That Christ is the measure is on Gods part attested as the 
expression for the immense reality a self possesses for it is true for the 

 



first time in Christ that God is mans goal and measure or measure and 
goal  But the more self the more intense the sin 

There is also another side from which the potentiation in sin can be 
shown In the first instance we considered that sin was despair its 
potentiation was despair over sin But now God offers reconciliation in 
the forgiveness of sins Yet the sinner despairs and despair acquires a 
still deeper expression It now relates itself after a sort to God but 
precisely thereby it is still further away still more deeply sunken in sin 
When the sinner despairs of the forgiveness of sins it is almost as if he 
were directly picking a quarrel with God it sounds in fact like a 
rejoinder when he says No there is not any forgiveness of sins it is 
an impossibility this looks like a handtohand scuffle But yet a man 
must remove himself to a qualitative distance from God in order to be 
able to say this and in order that it may be heard and in order to fight 
cominus he must be eminus so strangely constructed in an acoustic 
sense is the world of spirit so strangely are the relationships of 
distance arranged A man must be as far as possible removed from God 
for that No to be heard while yet in a way he wants to pick a quarrel 
with God The greatest possible nearness to God actually treading on 
His toes means to be far off In order to behave forwardly toward God 
one must retire far backward if one is nearer one cannot be forward 
and if one is forward this signifies eo ipso that one is far off O human 
impotence in the face of God When one behaves forwardly toward a 
man of high station one may perhaps as a punishment be cast far 
away from him but to behave forwardly toward God one must retire 
backward far from Him 

In real life the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins is generally 
misunderstood especially now that they have done away with the 

 



ethical so that one seldom or never hears a sound ethical word 
Aestheticmetaphysically it is honored as a sign of a deep nature that 
one despairs of the forgiveness of sins pretty much as if one were to 
regard it as a sign of a deep nature in a child that it is naughty On the 
whole it is unbelievable what confusion has invaded the religious 
sphere since in mans relationship to God there has been abolished the 
Thou shalt which is the only regulative principle This Thou shalt 
ought to be a part of every definition of the religious instead of which 
people have employed fantastically conceptions of God as an 
ingredient in human selfimportance so as to be selfimportant over 
against God As in political life one becomes important by belonging to 
the Opposition and in the last resort may well wish that there should 
be a government so that one might at least have something to oppose 
so in the last resort one does not wish to abolish God  if merely with 
a view to becoming still more selfimportant by being the Opposition 
And all that which in the old days was regarded with horror as the 
expression of impious insubordination has now become spirited the 
sign of a deep nature Thou shalt believe that is what was said in the 
old days as soberly as possible and in so many words  now it is 
spirited and the sign of a deep nature not to be able to do so Thou 
shalt believe in the forgiveness of sins was what they said and as the 
only commentary to this text it was said It will go ill with thee if thou 
canst not for what one shall do one can do  now it is spirited and 
the sign of a deeper nature not to be able to believe it Splendid result 
attained by Christendom If not a word about Christianity were heard 
men would not be so conceited as paganism never has been at any 
time but by the help of the fact that Christian conceptions are 
unchristianly floating in the air they are employed in the interest of 
this most potentiated impertinence in so far as they are not misused in 

 



another and equally shameless way For it surely is very epigrammatic 
that swearing was after all not customary in paganism but on the other 
hand is properly at home in Christendom that paganism generally 
uttered the name of God with great solemnity with a certain horror 
with a dread of the mysterious whereas in Christendom the name of 
God is surely the word which occurs most frequently in daily speech 
and is absolutely the word to which one attaches the least meaning 
and uses most carelessly because this poor revealed God who was so 
imprudent and unwise as to become revealed instead of keeping 
Himself hidden as superior persons always do has become a personage 
all too well known by the whole population to whom one renders an 
exceedingly great service by going once in a while to church where 
one is praised for it by the parson who on Gods behalf thanks one for 
the honor of the visit confers upon one the title of pious and on the 
other hand taunts a bit those who never do God the honor of going to 
church 

The sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins is offense The Jews 
were quite right in being offended at Christ because He would forgive 
sins It requires a singularly high degree of dullness that is to say the 
sort ordinarily found in Christendom in case a man is not a believer 
and if he is then he believes that Christ is God not to be offended at 
the fact that a man would forgive sins And in the next place it 
requires an equally singular degree of dullness not to be offended at 
the assertion that sin can be forgiven This is for the human 
understanding the most impossible thing Not that I would extol it as a 
sign of genius that one is unable to believe this for it shall be believed 

In paganism of course this sin did not exist If the pagan might have 
the true conception of sin but even this he could not have because he 

 



lacked the conception of God he could not get further than to despair 
over his sin Yea what is more and herein lies all the concession one 
can make to human understanding and human thinking one might 
praise the pagan who really managed to despair not over the world 
not over himself in general but over his sinOne will observe that 
despair over sin is here dialectically conceived in the direction toward 
faith That there is this dialectical possibility must never be forgotten 
even though this work only deals with despair as sin This dialectical 
possibility is due to the fact that despair is also the first factor in faith 
On the other hand when the direction is away from faith away from 
the Godrelationship despair over sin is the new sin In the life of spirit 
everything is dialectical Offense is thus as a possibility annulled a 
factor in faith but offense with a direction away from faith is sin One 
can reproach a man for not even being offended at Christianity When 
one speaks thus one speaks as being offended as something good and 
on the other hand one may say that to be offended is sin Humanly 
speaking both depths of understanding and ethical definitions are 
requisite for this No man as such can get further and seldom does 
one get so far But Christianly everything is altered for thou shalt 
believe in the forgiveness of sins 

And where does Christendom find itself with reference to the 
forgiveness of sins Indeed the situation of Christendom is really 
despair over the forgiveness of sins This however must be understood 
in the sense that Christendom is so backward that it is not even 
manifest that the situation is such People have not even reached the 
consciousness of sin they know only the kind of sin which paganism 
also knew and they live on happily in pagan security But by the fact 
that they live in Christendom they go further than paganism they go 

 



on to imagine that this security is    consciousness of the forgiveness 
of sins Indeed how can it be otherwise in Christendom In this the 
parsons confirm the congregation 

The fundamental misfortune of Christendom is really Christianity the 
fact that the doctrine of the GodMan the Christian understanding of 
which be it noted is secured by the paradox and the possibility of 
offense is taken in vain the qualitative distinction between God and 
man is pantheistically abolished  first speculatively with an air of 
superiority then vulgarly in the streets and alleys Never anywhere has 
any doctrine on earth brought God and man so near together as has 
Christianity neither could anyone else do it only God Himself can 
every human invention remains after all a dream an uncertain 
imagination Neither has any doctrine ever so carefully defended itself 
against the most shocking of all blasphemies that after God had taken 
this step it then should be taken in vain as though God and man 
coalesced in one and the same thing  never has any doctrine ever 
defended itself against this as Christianity has which defends itself by 
the help of the offense Woe unto the slack orators woe unto the loose 
thinkers and woe woe unto all the adherents who have learnt from 
them and extolled them 

If order is to be maintained in existence  and that after all is what 
God wills for He is not a God of confusion  first and foremost it 
must be remembered that every man is an individual man is himself 
conscious of being an individual man If once men are permitted to 
coalesce into what Aristotle calls the multitude a characteristic of 
beasts this abstraction instead of being regarded as less than nothing 
as in fact it is less than the lowliest individual man will be regarded as 
something and no long time will elapse before this abstraction 

 



becomes God And then why then in fact it corresponds philosophice 
with the GodMan Then as people in the various nations have learnt 
that the multitude overawes the King and the daily papers overawe the 
Privy Council so then at last they discover that the summa summarum 
of all men overawes God This then is called the doctrine of the God
Man or the doctrine that God and men are idem per idem identical 
Naturally several of the philosophers who took part in spreading this 
doctrine of the preponderance of the generations of mankind over the 
individual now turn away in disgust when their doctrine has sunk so 
low that the mob is God But these philosophers forget that after all 
this was their doctrine they overlook the fact that it was not more true 
when the superior men accepted it when the lite of the superior class 
or an elect circle of philosophers was the Incarnation 

This means that the doctrine of the GodMan has made Christendom 
impudent It almost appears as if God had been too weak It is as 
though it had come to pass with Him as with the goodnatured man 
who makes too great a concession and is rewarded by ingratitude It 
was God who discovered the doctrine of the GodMan and now 
Christendom has got the thing turned topsyturvy and imputes to God 
consanguinity so that the concession God has made means pretty 
much what in these times it means when a king grants a freer 
constitution  and one knows well enough what that means He 
pretty well had to It is as though God had got Himself into an 
embarrassing situation it is as though the shrewd man were in the 
right if he were to say to God It is Thine own fault Why hast Thou 
put Thyself upon such familiar terms with man It never would have 
occurred to anyone never have entered into any mans heart that 

 



there might be likeness between God and man It was Thou Thyself 
that had this proclaimed now Thou art reaping the fruits 

Yet Christianity has secured itself from the very beginning It begins 
with the doctrine of sin The category of sin is the category of the 
individual Speculatively sin cannot be thought at all The individual 
man is subsumed under the concept one cannot think an individual 
man but only the concept man  Hence it is that Speculation at once 
reaches the doctrine of the preponderance of the generations over the 
individual for it is not to be expected that Speculation should 
recognize the impotence of the concept in relation to reality  But as 
one cannot think an individual man so neither can one think an 
individual sinner one can think sin then it becomes negative but not 
an individual sinner Just for this reason however there can be no 
seriousness about sin when it is merely thought For seriousness is 
precisely the fact that thou and I are sinners Seriousness is not sin in 
general but the emphasis of seriousness falls upon the sinner who is 
an individual In relation to the individual man Speculation if it is 
consistent must think very scornfully of what it is to be an individual 
or that it is something which cannot be thought If it would do 
anything in this line it must say to the individual Is that anything to 
waste time on Above all try to forget it to be an individual man is 
not to be anything  think and then thou art the whole of humanity 
cogito ergo sum This however might perhaps be a lie and the 
individual might be the highest Yet suppose it is so But to be entirely 
consistent Speculation must also say The thing of being an individual 
sinner thats not to be anything it is subsumed under the concept 
waste no time on it etc And then what further Is one perhaps to 
think sin instead of being an individual sinner  just as one was 

 



exhorted to think the concept of man instead of being the individual 
man And then what further Does a man become himself sin by 
thinking sin Cogito ergo sum A capital proposal However one does 
not even in this case need to be afraid of becoming sin    the pure 
sin for sin cannot be thought This after all Speculation itself might 
concede since sin is in fact a falling away from the concept But not to 
dispute any longer e concessis the principal difficulty is another 
Speculation does not take heed of the fact that in relation to sin the 
ethical has its place which employs an emphasis which is the converse 
of that of Speculation and accomplishes the opposite development for 
the ethical does not abstract from reality but goes deeper into reality 
operating essentially by the aid of the category of the individual which 
is the category overlooked and despised by Speculation Sin is a 
characteristic of the individual it is frivolity and a new sin to act as if 
it were nothing to be an individual sinner Here Christianity is in place 
It marks a cross before Speculation It is as impossible for Speculation 
to get out of this difficulty as for a sailing vessel to sail directly against 
a contrary wind The seriousness of sin is its reality in the individual 
whether it be thou or I Speculatively one has to look away from the 
individual So it is only frivolously one can talk speculatively about sin 
The dialectic of sin is directly contrary to that of Speculation 

Here Christianity begins with the doctrine of sin and therefore with the 
individualThe doctrine of the sin of the human race has often been 
misused because it has not been noticed that sin common though it is 
to all does not gather men together in a common concept into a 
society or a partnership any more than out in the churchyard the 
multitude of the dead constitute a society but it splits men into 
individuals and holds every individual fast as a sinner  a splitting 

 



which in another sense is both in correspondence with and 
teleologically in the direction of the perfection of existence This men 
have not observed and so they have let the fallen race become once 
for all good again in Christ And so in turn they have saddled God with 
an abstraction which as an abstraction presumes to claim kinship with 
Him But this is a false pretext which only makes men insolent For if 
the individual is to feel himself akin to God and this is the doctrine of 
Christianity the whole weight of this falls upon him in fear and 
trembling and he must discover if it were not an old discovery the 
possibility of offense But if the individual is to attain this glory 
through an abstraction the thing becomes too easy and essentially it 
is taken in vain The individual does not in this case get the prodigious 
weight of God which by humiliation presses down as deeply as it 
uplifts the individual imagines that he possesses everything as a matter 
of course by participating in this abstraction Being a man is not like 
being an animal where the specimen is always less than the species 
Man is distinguished from other animals not only by the advantages 
which are commonly enumerated but qualitatively by the fact that the 
individual is more than the species And this characteristic is again 
dialectical it means that the individual is a sinner but then again that 
it is perfection to be the individualThe doctrine of the sin of the 
human race has often been misused because it has not been noticed 
that sin common though it is to all does not gather men together in a 
common concept into a society or a partnership any more than out 
in the churchyard the multitude of the dead constitute a society but 
it splits men into individuals and holds every individual fast as a sinner 
 a splitting which in another sense is both in correspondence with 
and teleologically in the direction of the perfection of existence This 
men have not observed and so they have let the fallen race become 

 



once for all good again in Christ And so in turn they have saddled God 
with an abstraction which as an abstraction presumes to claim kinship 
with Him But this is a false pretext which only makes men insolent 
For if the individual is to feel himself akin to God and this is the 
doctrine of Christianity the whole weight of this falls upon him in fear 
and trembling and he must discover if it were not an old discovery 
the possibility of offense But if the individual is to attain this glory 
through an abstraction the thing becomes too easy and essentially it 
is taken in vain The individual does not in this case get the prodigious 
weight of God which by humiliation presses down as deeply as it 
uplifts the individual imagines that he possesses everything as a matter

Man is distinguished from other animals not only by the advantages 
which are commonly enumerated but qualitatively by the fact that the 
individual is more than the species And this characteristic is again 
dialectical it means that the individual is a sinner but then again that 
it is perfection to be the individual For it is Christianity to be sure 
which has taught this about the GodMan about the likeness between 
God and man but Christianity is a great hater of wanton and 
impertinent forwardness By the help of the doctrine of sin and of the 
individual sinner God and Christ have been secured once for all and far 
better than any king against the nation the people the crowd etc 
item against every demand for a freer constitution All these 
abstractions are before God nonexistent before God in Christ there live 
only individual men sinners   yet God can well oversee the whole 
He can care for the sparrows too God is wholly a friend of order and 
to that end He is Himself present at every point in every instant He is 
omnipresent  which is specified in the textbooks as one of the titles 

 



by which God is called which men once in a while think about a little 
but surely never try to think every instant His concept is not like that 
of man under which the individual is subsumed as a thing which 
cannot be absorbed by the concept His concept comprises everything 
and in another sense He has no concept God does not help Himself by 
an abbreviation He comprehends comprehendit reality itself all the 
individuals for Him the individual is not subsumed under the concept 

The doctrine of sin the doctrine that we are sinners thou and I which 
absolutely disperses the crowd fixes then the qualitative distinction 
between God and man more deeply than ever it was fixed anywhere  
for again this God alone can do sin is in fact before God etc In no 
respect is a man so different from God as in the fact that he is a sinner 
as every man is and is a sinner before God whereby indeed the 
opposites are held together in a double sense they are held together 
continentur not allowed to separate from one another but by being 
thus held together the differences display themselves all the more 
strikingly as when one speaks of holding colors together opposita 
juxta se posita magis illucescunt Sin is the only thing universally 
predicated of man which cannot in any way either via negationis or 
via eminentia be affirmed of God It may be affirmed of God that He is 
not finite as man is and so via negationis that He is infinite but to 
affirm of God that He is not a sinner is blasphemy As a sinner man is 
separated from God by a yawning qualitative abyss And obviously God 
is separated from man by the same yawning qualitative abyss when He 
forgives sins In case it were possible by a converse kind of 
accommodation to transfer the divine attributes to a human being in 
one respect man will never in all eternity come to resemble God 
namely in forgiving sins 

 



Here then lies the utmost concentration of the offense which precisely 
that doctrine has found necessary which teaches the likeness between 
God and man 

But offense is the most decisive determinant of subjectivity of the 
individual man the most decisive it is possible to think of Doubtless to 
think of offense without thinking the offended man is not so 
impossible as to think of the music of the flute without thinking the 
fluteplayer but after all even thought must admit that offense even 
more than love is an unreal concept which only becomes real when 
there is an individual who is offended 

So then offense is related to the individual And therewith Christianity 
begins by making every man an individual an individual sinner and 
now everything that heaven and earth can manage to raise up by way 
of the possibility of offense God alone disposing of it is concentrated 
in one place  and that is Christianity Then it says to every individual 
Thou shalt believe ie thou shalt either be offended or thou shalt 
believe Not one word more There is nothing more to add Now I 
have spoken says God in eternity we shall speak together again In 
the meanwhile thou canst do what thou wilt but the Judgment is to 
come 

What a judgment Why we men have learned indeed experience 
teaches that when there is a mutiny aboard ship or in an army the 
guilty are so numerous that the punishment cannot be applied and 
when it is a question of the public the highly respected cultured 
public then not only is there no crime but according to the 
newspapers upon which one can rely as upon the Gospel or divine 
revelation this is the will of God Why is this The reason for it is that 

 



the concept of judgment corresponds to the individual one does not 
pronounce a judgment en masse one can put the people to death en 
masse play the hose on them en masse flatter them en masse in fine 
can treat the people in many ways like beasts but to hold judgment 
over the people as beasts one cannot do for one cannot hold 
judgment over beasts even though ever so many are judged if there is 
to be any seriousness and truth in the judgment it is each individual 
who is judgedLo for this reason God is the Judge because before 
him there is no crowd but only individuals Now when the guilty are 
so numerous it is not humanly possible to do this therefore one must 
give the whole thing up one perceives that there can be no question 
of any judgment they are too numerous to be judged one cannot 
make them or in any way manage to make them individuals so one 
must give up holding judgment 

And since now in our enlightened age when people find all 
anthropomorphic and anthropathic conceptions of God improper yet 
do not find it improper to think of God as a judge in likeness of an 
ordinary civil judge or solicitor general who cannot get at the rights of 
such a prolix affair  they conclude then that it will be exactly so in 
eternity Therefore only let us hold together and secure ourselves by 
seeing to it that the parson preachifies in this way And if there should 
be an individual who ventured to talk differently an individual who 
was foolish enough to make his own life anxious and responsible in 
fear and trembling and should then want also to worry others  then 
let us secure ourselves by regarding him as mad or if need be by 
putting him to death If only there are many of us engaged in it it is 
not wrong what the many do is the will of God To this wisdom as we 
know by experience  for we are not inexperienced youths we do not 

 



throw out ill considered words we talk as men of experience  all men 
hitherto have submitted kings and emperors and their excellencies By 
the aid of this wisdom all our cattle have been bred up  and by Jove 
God shall also have to submit to it The thing to do is to become 
many a whole lot of us if we do that then we are secured against the 
judgment of eternity 

Yes doubtless they are secured if it was only in eternity they became 
individuals But they were and are before God constantly individuals A 
man seated in a glass case is not put to such embarrassment as is a 
man in his transparency before God This is the factor of conscience 
By the aid of conscience things are so arranged that the judicial report 
follows at once upon every fault and that the guilty one himself must 
write it But it is written with sympathetic ink and only becomes 
thoroughly clear when in eternity it is held up to the light while 
eternity holds audit over the consciences Substantially everyone arrives 
in eternity bringing with him and delivering the most accurate account 
of every least insignificance which he has committed or has left 
undone Therefore to hold judgment in eternity is a thing a child could 
manage there is really nothing for a third person to do everything 
even to the most insignificant word is counted and in order The case 
of the guilty man who journeys through life to eternity is like that of 
the murderer who with the speed of the railway train fled from the 
place where he perpetrated his crime Alas just under the railway coach 
where he sat ran the electric telegraph with its signal and the order for 
his apprehension at the next station When he reached the station and 
alighted from the coach he was arrested In a way he had himself 
brought the denunciation with him 

 



So then despair of the forgiveness of sins is offense And offense is the 
potentiation of sin Generally one hardly thinks of this as sin at all it is 
likely that people hardly account offense a sin and of that therefore 
they do not talk but rather of sins among which offense has no place 
Still less do they interpret offense as the potentiation of sin This is due 
to the fact that they do not Christianly construct the opposition sin 
faith but sinvirtue 

 The Sin of Abandoning Christianity Modo Ponendo of Declaring 
It Falsehood 

This is sin against the Holy Ghost The self is here most despairingly 
potentiated it not merely casts away from itself the whole of 
Christianity but it makes it a lie and a falsehood What a prodigiously 
despairing conception of itself that self must have 

The potentiation of sin is clearly shown when it is apprehended as a 
war between man and God where the tactics are changed the 
potentiation ascends from the defensive to the offensive Sin is despair 
here one fights by evading Then came despair over ones sin here one 
still is fighting by evasion or by fortifying oneself in the position to 
which one has retired but constantly pedem referens foot backwards 
Now the tactic is changed notwithstanding that sin becomes more and 
more absorbed in itself and so withdraws yet in another sense it 
comes nearer becomes more and more decisively itself Despair of the 
forgiveness of sins is a definite position directly in the face of the offer 
of Gods compassion sin is now not entirely in flight not merely on 
the defensive But the sin of abandoning Christianity as a falsehood 
and a lie is offensive warfare All the foregoing forms of despair 

 



conceded in a way that the adversary is the stronger but now sin is 
aggressive 

Sin against the Holy Ghost is the positive form of offense 

The doctrine of Christianity is the doctrine of the GodMan of kinship 
between God and men but in such a way be it noted that the 
possibility of offense is if I may dare to express it thus the guarantee 
whereby God makes sure that man cannot come too near to Him The 
possibility of offense is the dialectical factor in everything Christian 
Take that away and then Christianity is not simply paganism but 
something so fantastic that paganism might well declare it bosh To be 
so near to God as Christianity teaches that man can come to Him and 
dare come to Him and shall come to Him in Christ has never entered 
into any mans head If this then is to be understood bluntly just as a 
matter of course without the least reservation to be taken quite 
unconcernedly and flippantly  then if paganisms poetic fiction 
about the gods might be called human craziness Christianity might be 
the invention of a crazy god such a doctrine could only occur to a god 
who had lost his wits  so a man must judge who had kept his wits 
The incarnate God if man wanted to be as it were a chum of His 
would be an apt counterpart to Prince Henry in Shakespeare 

God and man are two qualities between which there is an infinite 
qualitative difference Every doctrine which overlooks this difference is 
humanly speaking crazy understood in a godly sense it is blasphemy 
In paganism man made God a man the ManGod in Christianity God 
makes Himself man the GodMan  but in the infinite love of His 
compassionate grace He made nevertheless one stipulation He can do 
no other This precisely is the sorrow in Christ He can do no other 

 



He can humble Himself take the form of a servant suffer and die for 
man invite all to come unto Him sacrifice every day of His life and 
every hour of the day and sacrifice His life  but the possibility of the 
offense He cannot take away Oh unique work of love Oh 
unfathomable sorrow of love that God Himself cannot as in another 
sense He does not will cannot will it but even if He would He could 
not make it impossible that this work of love might not turn out to be 
for a person exactly the opposite to be the extremist misery For the 
greatest possible human misery greater even than sin is to be 
offended in Christ and remain offended And Christ cannot Love 
cannot render this impossible Lo for this reason He says Blessed is 
he who shall not be offended in me More He cannot do So then He 
may that is possible He may by His love have the effect of making a 
man more miserable than ever in any other way he could become Oh 
unfathomable contradiction in love But for all that in love He cannot 
find the heart to leave unfinished the work of love Alas if then this 
were to make a man more miserable than ever in any other way he 
could become 

Let us talk of this quite humanly Ah wretched is the man who never 
has felt the compelling urge of love to sacrifice everything out of love 
and who accordingly has not been able to do it But then when he 
discovered that precisely this sacrifice of his out of love might possibly 
occasion the other the loved one the greatest unhappiness  what 
then Then either love within him lost its resilience from being a life 
of power collapsed into the introverted rumination of a sad sentiment 
he was a deserter to love he did not venture to perform this work of 
love himself sinking down not under this work but under the weight 
of this possibility For just as a weight is infinitely heavier when it is 

 



attached to the end of a rod and the man who lifts it has to hold the 
opposite end so every work becomes infinitely harder when it becomes 
dialectic so that what love prompts one to do for the beloved care for 
the beloved seems again in another sense to dissuade from doing  Or 
else love conquered and he ventured to do this work out of love Oh 
but in the joyfulness of love as love always is joyful especially when it 
sacrifices all there was nevertheless a deep sorrow  for this sad result 
indeed was possible Behold he therefore brought to completion this 
work of love he offered the sacrifice in which for his part he exulted 
but not without tears Over this  what shall I call it  historical 
painting of inward life there hovered that dark possibility And yet if 
this had not hovered over it his work would not have been that of true 
love  O my friend what hast thou maybe attempted to do in life 
Tax thy brain tear off every covering and lay bare the viscera of feeling 
in thy breast surmount every barrier which separates thee from him of 
whom thou readest and then read Shakespeare  and thou shalt 
shrink from the collisions But Shakespeare himself seems to have 
shrunk back from the genuinely religions collisions Perhaps these can 
only be expressed in the language of the gods And this language no 
man can speak for as a Greek already has said so beautifully From 
men man learns to speak from the gods to keep silent 

That there is an infinite difference of quality between God and man is 
the possibility of offense which cannot be taken away Out of love God 
becomes man He says Look what it is to be a man but He adds O 
take heed for at the same time I am God  blessed is he who shall not 
be offended in me As man He assumes the lowly form of a servant He 
expresses what it is to be a lowly man to the intent that no one shall 
think himself excluded or think that it is human prestige or prestige 

 



among men which brings one nearer to God No he is the lowly man 
Look hither He says and learn what it is to be a man O but take 
heed for at the same time I am God  blessed is he who shall not be 
offended in me Or conversely I and the Father are one and yet I am 
this particular lowly man poor forsaken delivered into the hands of 
men  blessed is he who shall not be offended in me I this lowly 
man am He who maketh the deaf to hear the blind to see the lame to 
walk the leper to be cleansed the dead to rise up  blessed is he who 
shall not be offended in me 

Under accountability to the highest seat of authority I therefore make 
bold to say that these words blessed is he who shall not be offended 
in me belong essentially to the preaching about Christ if not in the 
same way as the words of institution at the Holy Communion yet at 
least like the words let every man examine himself They are Christs 
own words and they must especially in Christendom be again and 
again enjoined repeated addressed to every man severally 
EverywhereAnd such is now the case almost everywhere in 
Christendom which as it seems either entirely ignores the fact that 
Christ Himself it is who so frequently and with such heartfelt emphasis 
warned against offense even at the end of His life and even when He 
addressed His faithful Apostles who had followed Him from the 
beginning and for His sake had forsaken all  or maybe silently 
regards this as an extravagant apprehension on the part of Christ 
inasmuch as the experience of thousands and thousands proves that 
one can have faith in Christ without having noticed the least trace of 
the possibility of offense But this might be a mistake which surely will 
be made evident when the possibility of offense shall judge 
Christendom where these words do not resound or at least wherever 

 



the statement of Christianity is not at every point permeated by this 
thought  there Christianity is blasphemy For without a bodyguard 
without servants who might prepare His way and make men attentive 
to who it was that came Christ walked here upon earth in the lowly 
form of a servant But the possibility of offense O how great a sorrow 
this was to Him in His love defended Him and defends Him fixes a 
yawning abyss between Him and the man who was closest to Him and 
stood nearest 

For he who is not offended worships in faith But to worship which is 
the expression of faith is to express the consciousness that the infinite 
yawning abyss of quality is fixed between them For in faith again the 
possibility of offense Is the dialectical factorHere is a little task for 
acute observers In case one assumes that all the many parsons here 
and in foreign lands who deliver and write sermons are believing 
Christians how can it be explained that one never hears or reads a 
prayer which in our time especially is so pertinent God in heaven I 
thank Thee that Thou hast not required it of man that he should 
comprehend Christianity for if that were required I should be of all 
men the most miserable The more I seek to comprehend it the more 
incomprehensible it appears to me and the more I discover merely the 
possibility of offense Therefore I thank Thee that Thou dost only 
require faith and I pray Thee to increase it more and more This 
prayer would from the point of view of orthodoxy be entirely correct 
and assuming that it is true in the man who prays it at the same time 
would be correct as irony upon Speculation as a whole But is faith I 
wonder to be found on earth 

 



But the sort of offense here in question is modo ponendo it affirms of 
Christianity that it is a falsehood and a lie and therefore affirms the 
same of Christ 

To illustrate this sort of offense it is best to pass in review the various 
forms of offense which are fundamentally related to the paradox 
Christ and then with every definition to come back to the Christian 
conception for every such definition is related to Christ has Christ in 
mente 

The lowest form of offense that which humanly speaking is the least 
guilty is to let the whole question about Christ remain undecided and 
to judge in this fashion I do not presume to pass any judgment I do 
not believe but I pass no judgment That this is a form of offense 
escapes the attention of most men The fact is that people have clean 
forgotten the Christian thou shalt Therefore it is that they do not 
perceive that this is offense this thing of treating Christ as a matter of 
indifference The fact that Christ is preached to thee signifies that thou 
shalt have an opinion about Christ The judgment that He is or that He 
exists or that He has existed is the decision for the whole of existence 
If Christ is preached to thee it is offense to say I will have no opinion 
about it 

This however must be understood with a certain qualification in these 
times inasmuch as Christianity is so poorly preached as it now is There 
doubtless are living thousands of men who have heard Christ preached 
and have never heard a word about this shall But he who has heard 
it and says I will have no opinion about it is offended For he denies 
the divinity of Christ when he denies that it has a right to require a 
man to have an opinion It is of no avail for such a man to say I do 

 



not affirm anything about Christ either yes or no for then one has 
only to ask Hast thou then no opinion as to whether thou shalt have 
an opinion about this or not and if he replies Well yes he has 
trapped himself and if he replies No then Christianity condemns 
him all the same requiring that he shall have an opinion about 
Christianity and also about Christ that no one shall presume to treat 
Christ as a curiosity When God lets Himself be born and becomes man 
this is not an idle notion of His something that occurs to Him as a way 
of undertaking something to put an end after all to the boredom 
which people have been impudent enough to say must be associated 
with being God  it is not for the interest of an adventure No when 
God does this it is the seriousness of existence And the seriousness in 
this seriousness is that every one shall have an opinion about it When 
a king visits a provincial town he regards it as an affront if without 
sufficient excuse an officebearer in the town fails to do him homage 
But what I wonder would he judge if one were to ignore entirely the 
fact that the King was in town were to behave as a private person who 
on such an occasion doesnt care a fig for His Majesty and the royal 
law And so it is also when it pleases God to become man  that 
then it pleases a man and what the officebearer is to the King that is 
every man before God to say of it Well thats something about 
which I dont wish to have any opinion So it is one speaks 
superciliously of that upon which one essentially looks down  and so 
one superciliously looks down upon God 

The next form of offense is the negative but passive form It feels to be 
sure that it is not able to ignore Christianity it is not capable of letting 
all that about Christ remain in doubt and then being for the rest busy 
about life But neither does it believe it continues to stare at one and 

 



the same point the paradox To that extent it honors Christianity after 
all it gives expression to the conviction that the question What think 
ye of Christ is the most decisive question Such an offended man 
lives on like a shadow his life is consumed because in his inmost soul 
he is constantly preoccupied with this decision And thus he attests as 
the suffering of unhappy love attests the reality of love  he attests 
what a reality Christianity possesses 

The last form of offense is that about which we are speaking in this 
chapter the positive form It declares that Christianity is a falsehood 
and a lie it denies Christ that He existed and That He is what He 
claimed to be either docetically or rationalistically so that Christ either 
does not become a particular man except apparently or He becomes 
only a particular man so that He either becomes docetically poetry 
and mythology which make no claim to reality or rationalistically a 
reality which makes no claim to be divine In this denial of Christ as the 
paradox there is naturally implied the denial of everything Christian 
sin the forgiveness of sins etc 

This form of offense is sin against the Holy Ghost As the Jews said of 
Christ that He cast out devils by the help of the devil so does this form 
of offense make of Christ an invention of the devil 

This offense is the highest potentiation of sin which is a fact people 
generally overlook inasmuch as they do not Christianly construct the 
opposition sinfaith 

On the other hand this opposition is affirmed in the whole of this 
work which straightway in the first section IA constructed the 
formula for the situation where no offense at all is to be found By 

 



relating itself to its own self and by willing to be itself the self is 
grounded transparently in the Power which constituted it And this 
formula again as has often been noted is the definition of faith
