PREFACE 
THE ESSAYS and lectures of which this book is composed are variations upon one very simple themethe thesis 
that we can learn from our mistakes They develop a theory of knowledge and of its growth It is a theory of 
reason that assigns to rational arguments the modest and yet important role of criticizing our often mistaken attempts 
to solve our problems And it is a theory of experience that assigns to our observations the equally modest and 
almost equally important role of tests which may help us in the discovery of our mistakes Though it stresses our 
fallibility it does not resign itself to scepticism for it also stresses the fact that knowledge can grow and that science 
can progressjust because we can learn from our mistakes 

The way in which knowledge progresses and especially our scientific knowledge is by unjustified and unjustifiable 
anticipations by guesses by tentative solutions to our problems by conjectures These conjectures are controlled 
by criticism that is by attempted refutations which include severely critical tests They may survive these tests 
but they can never be positively justified they can neither be established as certainly true nor even as probable in 
the sense of the probability calculus Criticism of our conjectures is of decisive importance by bringing out our 
mistakes it makes us understand the difficulties of the problem which we are trying to solve This is how we become 
better acquainted with our problem and able to propose more mature solutions the very refutation of a theorythat 
is of any serious tentative solution to our problemis always a step forward that takes us nearer to the truth And this 
is how we can learn from our mistakes 

As we learn from our mistakes our knowledge grows even though we may never knowthat is know for certain 
Since our knowledge can grow there can be no reason here for despair of reason And since we can never know for 
certain there can be no authority here for any claim to authority for conceit over our knowledge or for smugness 

Those among our theories which turn out to be highly resistant to criticism and which appear to us at a certain 
moment of time to be better approximations to truth than other known theories may be described together with the 
reports of their tests as the science of that time Since none of them can be positively justified it is essentially their 
critical and progressive character the fact that we can argue about their claim to solve our problems better than 
their competitorswhich constitutes the rationality of science 

This in a nutshell is the fundamental thesis developed in this book and applied to many topics ranging from 
problems of the philosophy and history

of the physical sciences and of the social sciences to historical and political problems 

I have relied upon my central thesis to give unity to the book and upon the diversity of my topics to make acceptable 
the marginal overlapping of some of the chapters I have revised augmented and rewritten most of them but I have 
refrained from changing the distinctive character of the lectures and broadcast addresses It would have been easy to 
get rid of the telltale style of the lecturer but I thought that my readers would rather make allowances for that style 
than feel that they had not been taken into the authors confidence I have let a few repetitions stand so that every 
chapter of the book remains selfcontained 

As a hint to prospective reviewers I have also included a reviewa severely critical one it forms the last chapter of 
the book I have excluded all those papers which presuppose acquaintance on the part of the reader with 
technicalities in the field of logic probability theory etc But in the Addenda I have put together a few technical 
notes which may be useful to those who happen to be interested in these things The Addenda and four of the 
chapters are published here for the first time 

To avoid misunderstandings I wish to make it quite clear that I use the terms liberal liberalism etc always in a 
sense in which they are still generally used in England though perhaps not in America by a liberal I do not mean a 
sympathizer with any one political party but simply a man who values individual freedom and who is alive to the 
dangers inherent in all forms of power and authority 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

 

True philosophers who are burning with love for truth and learning never see themselves    as wise 
men brimfull of knowledge    For most of them would admit that even the very greatest number of 
things of which we know is only equal to the very smallest fraction of things of which we are ignorant 
Nor are these philosophers so addicted to any kind of tradition or doctrine that they suffer themselves 
to become their slaves and thus lose their liberty

ON THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE AND OF 
IGNORANCE 

It follows therefore that truth manifests itself    

BENEDICTUS DE SPINOZA

   it is impossible for us to think of any thing which we have not antecedently felt either by our 
external or internal senses 

DAVID HUME 

THE TITLE of this lecture is likely I fear to offend some critical ears For although Sources of Knowledge is in order 
and Sources of Error would have been in order too the phrase Sources of Ignorance is another matter Ignorance 
is something negative it is the absence of knowledge But how on earth can the absence of anything have sources 
 This question was put to me by a friend when I confided to him the title I had chosen for this lecture I was a little 
shaken by this for I had been I confess quite pleased with the title Hard pressed for a reply I found myself 
improvising a rationalization and explaining to my friend that the curious linguistic effect of the title was actually 
intended I told him that I hoped to direct attention through the phrasing of this title to a number of historically 
important although unrecorded philosophical doctrines and among them especially to a conspiracy theory of 
ignorance which interprets ignorance not as a mere lack of knowledge but as the work of some mischievous power 
the source of impure and evil influences which pervert and poison our minds and instil in us the habit of resistance to 
knowledge 

I am not quite sure whether this explanation allayed my friends misgivings but it did silence him Your case is 
different since you are silenced by the rules of the present transactions So I can only hope that I have 

 

 Descartes and Spinoza went even further and asserted that not only ignorance but also error is something 
negativea privation of knowledge and even of the proper use of our freedom See Descartes Principles 
Part I  and the Third and Fourth Meditations also Spinoza Ethics Part III propos  and schol 
and his Principles of Descartes Philosophy Part I propos  and schol Nevertheless they speak eg 
Ethics Part II propos  also of the cause of falsity or error

allayed your misgivings sufficiently for the time being to allow me to begin my story at the other endwith the 
sources of knowledge rather than with the sources of ignorance However I shall presently come back to the sources 
of ignorance and also to the conspiracy theory of these sources 

I 

The problem which I wish to examine afresh in this lecture and which I hope not only to examine but to solve may 
perhaps be described as an aspect of the old quarrel between the British and the Continental schools of philosophy 
the quarrel between the classical empiricism of Bacon Locke Berkeley Hume and Mill and the classical rationalism 
or intellectualism of Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz In this quarrel the British school insisted that the ultimate 
source of all knowledge was observation while the Continental school insisted that it was the intellectual intuition of 
clear and distinct ideas 

Most of these issues are still very much alive Not only has empiricism still the ruling doctrine in England conquered 
the United States but it is now widely accepted even on the European Continent as the true theory of scientific 
knowledge Cartesian intellectualism alas has been only too often distorted into one or another of the various forms 
of modern irrationalism 

I shall try to show in this lecture that the differences between classical empiricism and rationalism are much smaller 
than their similarities and that both are mistaken I hold that they are mistaken although I am myself both an 
empiricist and a rationalist of sorts But I believe that though observation and reason have each an important role to 
play these roles hardly resemble those which their classical defenders attributed to them More especially I shall try 
to show that neither observation nor reason can be described as a source of knowledge in the sense in which they 
have been claimed to be sources of knowledge down to the present day 

II 

Our problem belongs to the theory of knowledge or to epistemology reputed to be the most abstract and remote and 
altogether irrelevant region of pure philosophy Hume for example one of the greatest thinkers in the field predicted 

that because of the remoteness and abstractness and practical irrelevance of some of his results none of his 
readers would believe in them for more than an hour 

Kants attitude was different He thought that the problem What can I know was one of the three most important 
questions a man could ask Bertrand Russell in spite of being closer to Hume in philosophic temperament seems to 
side in this matter with Kant And I believe that Russell is right when he attributes to epistemology practical 
consequences for science for ethics and even for politics He points out for example that epistemological 
relativism or the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth 

 

 

and epistemological pragmatism or the idea that truth is the same as usefulness are closely linked with authoritarian 
and totalitarian ideas 

Russells views are of course disputed Some recent philosophers have developed a doctrine of the essential 
impotence and practical irrelevance of all genuine philosophy and thus one can assume of epistemology 
Philosophy they say cannot by its very nature have any significant consequences and so it can influence neither 
science nor politics But I think that ideas are dangerous and powerful things and that even philosophers have 
sometimes produced ideas Indeed I have no doubt that this new doctrine of the impotence of all philosophy is amply 
refuted by the facts 

The situation is really very simple The belief of a liberalthe belief in the possibility of a rule of law of equal justice 
of fundamental rights and a free societycan easily survive the recognition that judges are not omniscient and may 
make mistakes about facts and that in practice absolute justice is hardly ever realized in any particular legal case 
But this belief in the possibility of a rule of law of justice and of freedom can hardly survive the acceptance of an 
epistemology which teaches that there are no objective facts not merely in this particular case but in any other case 
and that the judge cannot have made a factual mistake because he can no more be wrong about the facts than he 
can be right 

III 

The great movement of liberation which started in the Renaissance and led through the many vicissitudes of the 
reformation and the religious and revolutionary wars to the free societies in which the Englishspeaking peoples are 
privileged to live this movement was inspired throughout by an unparalleled epistemological optimism by a most 
optimistic view of mans power to discern truth and to acquire knowledge 

At the heart of this new optimistic view of the possibility of knowledge lies the doctrine that truth is manifest Truth 
may perhaps be veiled But it may reveal itself  And if it does not reveal itself it may be revealed by us Removing 
the veil may not be easy But once the naked truth stands revealed before our eyes we have the power to see it to 
distinguish it from falsehood and to know that it is truth 

The birth of modern science and modern technology was inspired by this optimistic epistemology whose main 
spokesmen were Bacon and Descartes They taught that there was no need for any man to appeal to authority in 
matters of truth because each man carried the sources of knowledge in himself either in his power of sense

perception which he may use for the careful observation of nature or in his power of intellectual intuition which he 
may use to distinguish truth from falsehood by refusing to accept any idea which is not clearly and distinctly perceived 
by the intellect 

 

 See my first motto to this Introduction taken from Spinoza short treatise Of God Man and Human 
Happiness ch  Parallel passages are Ethics ii scholium to propos  Indeed as light manifests 
itself and darkness so with truth it is its own standard and that of falsity De intellectus emendatione 
  and letter  end of paragraph  

 

 

Man can know thus he can be free This is the formula which explains the link between epistemological 
optimism and the ideas of liberalism 

This link is paralleled by the opposite link Disbelief in the power of human reason in mans power to discern the 
truth is almost invariably linked with distrust of man Thus epistemological pessimism is linked historically with a 
doctrine of human depravity and it tends to lead to the demand for the establishment of powerful traditions and the 
entrenchment of a powerful authority which would save man from his folly and his wickedness There is a striking 
sketch of this theory of authoritarianism and a picture of the burden carried by those in authority in the story of The 
Grand Inquisitor in Dostoievskys The Brothers Karamazov 

The contrast between epistemological pessimism and optimism may be said to be fundamentally the same as that 
between epistemological traditionalism and rationalism I am using the latter term in its wider sense in which it is 
opposed to irrationalism and in which it covers not only Cartesian intellectualism but empiricism also For we can 
interpret traditionalism as the belief that in the absence of an objective and discernible truth we are faced with the 
choice between accepting the authority of tradition and chaos while rationalism has of course always claimed the 
right of reason and of empirical science to criticize and to reject any tradition and any authority as being based on 
sheer unreason or prejudice or accident 

IV 

It is a disturbing fact that even an abstract study like pure epistemology is not as pure as one might think and as 
Aristotle believed but that its ideas may to a large extent be motivated and unconsciously inspired by political hopes 
and by Utopian dreams This should be a warning to the epistemologist What can he do about it As an 
epistemologist I have only one interestto find out the truth about the problems of epistemology whether or not this 
truth fits in with my political ideas But am I not liable to be influenced unconsciously by my political hopes and 
beliefs 

It so happens that I am not only an empiricist and a rationalist of sorts but also a liberal in the English sense of this 
term but just because I am a liberal I feel that few things are more important for a liberal than to submit the various 
theories of liberalism to a searching critical examination 

While I was engaged in a critical examination of this kind I discovered the part played by certain epistemological 

theories in the development of liberal ideas and especially by the various forms of epistemological optimism And I 
found that as an epistemologist I had to reject these epistemological theories as untenable This experience of mine 
may illustrate the point that our dreams and our hopes need not necessarily control our results and that in searching 
for the truth it may be our best plan to start by criticizing our most cherished beliefs This may seem to some a 
perverse plan But it will not seem so to those who want to find the truth and are not afraid of it 

 

 

V 

In examining the optimistic epistemology inherent in certain ideas of liberalism I found a cluster of doctrines which 
although often accepted implicitly have not to my knowledge been explicitly discussed or even noticed by 
philosophers or historians The most fundamental of them is one which I have already mentionedthe doctrine that 
truth is manifest The strangest of them is the conspiracy theory of ignorance which is a curious outgrowth from the 
doctrine of manifest truth 

By the doctrine that truth is manifest I mean you will recall the optimistic view that truth if put before us naked is 
always recognizable as truth Thus truth if it does not reveal itself has only to be unveiled or discovered Once this 
is done there is no need for further argument We have been given eyes to see the truth and the natural light of 
reason to see it by 

This doctrine is at the heart of the teaching of both Descartes and Bacon Descartes based his optimistic 
epistemology on the important theory of the veracitas dei What we clearly and distinctly see to be true must 
indeed be true for otherwise God would be deceiving us Thus the truthfulness of God must make truth manifest 

In Bacon we have a similar doctrine It might be described as the doctrine of the veracitas naturae the 
truthfulness of Nature Nature is an open book He who reads it with a pure mind cannot misread it Only if his mind is 
poisoned by prejudice can he fall into error 

This last remark shows that the doctrine that truth is manifest creates the need to explain falsehood Knowledge the 
possession of truth need not be explained But how can we ever fall into error if truth is manifest The answer is 
through our own sinful refusal to see the manifest truth or because our minds harbour prejudices inculcated by 
education and tradition or other evil influences which have perverted our originally pure and innocent minds 
Ignorance may be the work of powers conspiring to keep us in ignorance to poison our minds by filling them with 
falsehood and to blind our eyes so that they cannot see the manifest truth Such prejudices and such powers then 
are sources of ignorance 

The conspiracy theory of ignorance is fairly well known in its Marxian form as the conspiracy of a capitalist press that 
perverts and suppresses truth and fills the workers minds with false ideologies Prominent among these of course 
are the doctrines of religion It is surprising to find how unoriginal this Marxist theory is The wicked and fraudulent 
priest who keeps the people in ignorance was a stock figure of the eighteenth century and I am afraid one of the 
inspirations of liberalism It can be traced back to the protestant belief in the conspiracy of the Roman Church and 
also to the beliefs of those dissenters who held similar views about the Established Church Elsewhere I have traced 
the prehistory of this belief back to Platos uncle Critias see chapter  section ii of my Open Society 

This curious belief in a conspiracy is the almost inevitable consequence of 

 

 

the optimistic belief that truth and therefore goodness must prevail if only truth is given a fair chance Let her and 
falsehood grapple who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter Areopagitica So when 
Miltons Truth was put to the worse the necessary inference was that the encounter had not been free and open if 
the manifest truth does not prevail it must have been maliciously suppressed One can see that an attitude of 
tolerance which is based upon an optimistic faith in the victory of truth may easily be shaken See J W N Watkins 
on Milton in The Listener nd January  For it is liable to turn into a conspiracy theory which would be hard 
to reconcile with an attitude of tolerance 

I do not assert that there was never a grain of truth in this conspiracy theory But in the main it was a myth just as the 
theory of manifest truth from which it grew was a myth 

For the simple truth is that truth is often hard to come by and that once found it may easily be lost again Erroneous 
beliefs may have an astonishing power to survive for thousands of years in defiance of experience and without the 
aid of any conspiracy The history of science and especially of medicine could furnish us with a number of good 
examples One example is indeed the general conspiracy theory itself I mean the erroneous view that whenever 
something evil happens it must be due to the evil will of an evil power Various forms of this view have survived down 
to our own day 

Thus the optimistic epistemology of Bacon and of Descartes cannot be true Yet perhaps the strangest thing in this 
story is that this false epistemology was the major inspiration of an intellectual and moral revolution without parallel in 
history It encouraged men to think for themselves It gave them hope that through knowledge they might free 
themselves and others from servitude and misery It made modern science possible It became the basis of the fight 
against censorship and the suppression of free thought It became the basis of the nonconformist conscience of 
individualism and of a new sense of mans dignity of a demand for universal education and of a new dream of a free 
society It made men feel responsible for themselves and for others and eager to improve not only their own 
condition but also that of their fellow men It is a case of a bad idea inspiring many good ones 

VI 

This false epistemology however has also led to disastrous consequences The theory that truth is manifestthat it 
is there for everyone to see if only he wants to see itthis theory is the basis of almost every kind of fanaticism For 
only the most depraved wickedness can refuse to see the manifest truth only those who have every reason to fear 
truth can deny it and conspire to suppress it 

Yet the theory that truth is manifest not only breeds fanaticsmen possessed by the conviction that all those who do 
not see the manifest truth must be possessed by the devilbut it may also lead though perhaps less directly than 
does a pessimistic epistemology to authoritarianism This is so 

 

simply because truth is not manifest as a rule The allegedly manifest truth is therefore in constant need not only of 
interpretation and affirmation but also of reinterpretation and reaffirmation An authority is required to pronounce 
upon and lay down almost from day to day what is to be the manifest truth and it may learn to do so arbitrarily and 
cynically And many disappointed epistemologists will turn away from their own former optimism and erect a 
resplendent authoritarian theory on the basis of a pessimistic epistemology It seems to me that the greatest 
epistemologist of all Plato exemplifies this tragic development 

VII 

Plato plays a decisive part in the prehistory of Descartes doctrine of the veracitas deithe doctrine that our 
intellectual intuition does not deceive us because God is truthful and will not deceive us or in other words the 
doctrine that our intellect is a source of knowledge because God is a source of knowledge This doctrine has a long 
history which can easily be traced back at least to Homer and Hesiod 

To us the habit of referring to ones sources would seem natural in a scholar or an historian and it is perhaps a little 
surprising to find that this habit stems from the poets but it does The Greek poets refer to the sources of their 
knowledge The sources are divine They are the Muses   the Greek bards Gilbert Murray observes  The Rise 
of the Greek Epic rd edn  p  always owe not only what we should call their inspiration but their 
actual knowledge of facts to the Muses The Muses are present and know all things    Hesiod    always explains 
that he is dependent on the Muses for his knowledge Other sources of knowledge are indeed recognized    But 
most often he consults the Muses    So does Homer for such subjects as the Catalogue of the Greek army 

As this quotation shows the poets were in the habit of claiming not only divine sources of inspiration but also divine 
sources of knowledgedivine guarantors of the truth of their stories 

Precisely the same two claims were raised by the philosophers Heraclitus and Parmenides Heraclitus it seems 
sees himself as a prophet who talks with raving mouth    possessed by the godby Zeus the source of all wisdom 
 DK  B    cf      And Parmenides one could almost say forms the missing link between Homer 
or Hesiod on the one side and Descartes on the other His guiding star and inspiration is the goddess Dike described 
by Heraclitus  DK B  as the guardian of truth Parmenides describes her as the guardian and keeper of the keys 
of truth and as the source of all his knowledge But Parmenides and Descartes have more in common than the 
doctrine of divine veracity For example Parmenides is told by his divine guarantor of truth that in order to distinguish 
between truth and falsehood he must rely upon the intellect alone to the exclusion of the senses of sight hearing 
and taste Cf Heraclitus B    and  

 

 DK  DielsKranz Fragmente der Vorsokratiker 

 

 

 

hint at unobservable changes yielding observable opposites And even the principle of his physical theory which 
like Descartes he founds upon his intellectualist theory of knowledge is the same as that adopted by Descartes it is 
the impossibility of a void the necessary fullness of the world 

In Plato Ion a sharp distinction is made between divine inspirationthe divine frenzy of the poetand the divine 
sources or origins of true knowledge The topic is further developed in the Phaedrus especially from e 
on and in bc Plato even insists as Harold Cherniss pointed out to me on the distinction 
between questions of origin and of truth Plato grants the inspiration to the poets but denies to 
them any divine authority for their alleged knowledge of facts Nevertheless the doctrine of the 
divine source of our knowledge plays a decisive part in Platos famous theory of anamnsis 
which in some measure grants to each man the possession of divine sources of knowledge 
The knowledge considered in this theory is knowledge of the essence or nature of a thing 
rather than of a particular historical fact According to Plato Meno bd there is nothing which 
our immortal soul does not know prior to our birth For as all natures are kindred and akin our 
soul must be akin to ail natures Accordingly it knows them all it knows all things On kinship 
and knowledge see also Phaedo d Republic d Laws d In being born we forget 
but we may recover our memory and our knowledge though only partially only if we see the 
truth again shall we recognize it All knowledge is therefore recognitionrecalling or 
remembering the essence or true nature that we once knew 

This theory implies that our soul is in a divine state of omniscience as long as it dwells and 
participates in a divine world of ideas or essences or natures prior to being born The birth of a 
man is his fall from grace it is his fall from a natural or divine state of knowledge and it is thus 
the origin and cause of his ignorance Here may be the seed of the idea that ignorance is sin 

It is clear that there is a close link between this theory of anamnsis and the doctrine of the 
divine origin or source of our knowledge At the same time there is also a close link between 
the theory of anamnsis and the doctrine of manifest truth if even in our depraved state of 
forgetfulness we see the truth we cannot but recognize it as the truth So as the result of 
anamnsis truth is restored to the status of that which is not forgotten and not concealed 
alths it is that which is manifest 

Socrates demonstrates this in a beautiful passage of the Meno by helping an uneducated young 
slave to recall the proof of a special case of the theorem of Pythagoras Here indeed is an 
optimistic epistemology and the root of Cartesianism It seems that in the Meno Plato was 
conscious of the highly optimistic character of his theory for he describes it as a doctrine which 
makes men eager to learn to search and to discover 

Yet disappointment must have come to Plato for in the Republic and also in the Phaedrus we 
find the beginnings of a pessimistic epistemology In the famous story of the prisoners in the 
cave  ff he shows that the world of 

 

 

our experience is only a shadow a reflection of the real world And he shows that even if one of the prisoners should 
escape from the cave and face the real world he would have almost insuperable difficulties in seeing and 
understanding itto say nothing of his difficulties in trying to make those understand who stayed behind The 
difficulties in the way of an understanding of the real world are almost superhuman and only the very few if anybody 
at all can attain to the divine state of understanding the real worldthe divine state of true knowledge of epistm 

This is a pessimistic theory with regard to almost all men though not with regard to all For it teaches that truth may 
be attained by a fewthe elect With regard to these it is one might say more wildly optimistic than even the doctrine 
that truth is manifest The authoritarian and traditionalist consequences of this pessimistic theory are fully elaborated 
in the Laws 

Thus we find in Plato the first transition from an optimistic to a pessimistic epistemology Each of them forms the 
basis of one of the two diametrically opposed philosophies of the state and of society on the one hand an 
antitraditionalist antiauthoritarian revolutionary and Utopian rationalism of the Cartesian kind and on the other hand 
an authoritarian traditionalism 

This development may well be connected with the fact that the idea of an epistemological fall of man can be 
interpreted not only in the sense of the optimistic doctrine of anamnsis but also in a pessimistic sense 

In this latter interpretation the fall of man condemns all mortalsor almost allto ignorance I think one can discern in 
the story of the cave and perhaps also in the story of the fall of the city when the Muses and their divine teaching 
are neglected see Republic d an echo of an interesting older form of this idea I have in mind Parmenides 
doctrine that the opinions of mortals are delusions and the result of a misguided choicea misguided convention 
This may stem from Xenophanes doctrine that all human knowledge is guesswork and that his own theories are at 
best merely similar to the truth   The idea of an epistemological fall of man can perhaps be found as Karl 
Reinhardt suggested in those words of the goddess that mark the transition from the way of truth to the way of 
delusive opinion  

But you also shall learn how it was that delusive opinion 
Forcing its way through all things was destined to pass for the real    

Now of this world thus arranged to seem wholly like truth I shall tell you 
Then you will be nevermore overawed by the notions of mortals 

Thus though the fall affects all men the truth may be revealed to the elect by an act of graceeven the truth about 
the unreal world of the delusions 

 

 Xenophanes fragment here alluded to is DK B  quoted here in ch  section xii below For the idea of 
similarity to the truthor of a statement which partly corresponds to the factssee especially ch  section 
xiv below where verisimilitude is contrasted with probability

and opinions the conventional notions and decisions of mortals the unreal world of appearance that was destined to 
be accepted and approved of as real  

The revelation received by Parmenides and his conviction that a few may reach certainty about both the unchanging 
world of eternal reality and the unreal and changing world of verisimilitude and deception were two of the main 
inspirations of Platos philosophy It was a theme to which he was for ever returning oscillating between hope 
despair and resignation 

VIII 

Yet what interests us here is Platos optimistic epistemology the theory of anamnsis in the Meno It contains I 
believe not only the germs of Descartes intellectualism but also the germs of Aristotles and especially of Bacons 
theories of induction 

For Menos slave is helped by Socrates judicious questions to remember or recapture the forgotten knowledge which 
his soul possessed in its prenatal state of omniscience It is I believe this famous Socratic method called in the 
Theaetetus the art of midwifery or maieutic to which Aristotle alluded when he said  Metaphysics b
 see also b that Socrates was the inventor of the method of induction 

Aristotle and also Bacon I wish to suggest meant by induction not so much the inferring of universal laws from 
particular observed instances as a method by which we are guided to the point whence we can intuit or perceive the 
essence or the true nature of a thing  But this as we have seen is precisely the aim of Socrates maieutic its aim 
is to help or lead us to anamnsis and anamnsis is the power of seeing the true nature or essence of a thing 
the nature or essence with which we were acquainted before birth before our fall from grace Thus the aims of the 
two maieutic and induction are the same Incidentally Aristotle taught that the result of an inductionthe intuition 
of the essencewas to be expressed by a definition of that essence 

Now let us look more closely at the two procedures The maieutic art of Socrates consists essentially in asking 
questions designed to destroy pre 

 

 It is interesting to contrast this pessimistic view of the necessity of error with the optimism of Descartes or of 
Spinoza who in his th letter paragraph  scorns those who dream of an impure spirit inspiring us with false 
ideas which are similar to true ones veris similes see also ch  section xiv below 

 Aristotle meant by induction epagg at least two different things which he sometimes links together One is a 
method by which we are led to intuit the general principle  Anal Priora a  f referring to the Meno and 
to anamnsis The other  Topicsa  a   a  Anal Posteriora a   b  ff is a 
method of adducing particular evidencepositive evidence rather than critical evidence or counter
examples The first method seems to me the older one and the one which can be better connected with Socrates 
and his maieutic method of criticism and counterexamples The second method seems to originate in the attempt 
to systematize induction logically or as Aristotle  Anal Priora b  ff puts it to construct a valid 
syllogism which springs out of induction this to be valid must of course be a syllogism of 
perfect or complete induction complete enumeration of instances and ordinary induction in 
the sense of the second method here mentioned is just a weakened and invalid form of this 
valid syllogism 

 

 

judices false beliefs which are often traditional or fashionable beliefs false answers given in the spirit of ignorant 
cocksureness Socrates himself does not pretend to know His attitude is described by Aristotle in the words  
Socrates raised questions but gave no answers for he confessed that he did not know  Sophist El b cf 
Theaetetus cd c b Thus Socrates maieutic is not an art that aims at teaching any 
belief but one that aims at purging or cleansing cf the allusion to the Amphidromia in 
Theaetetus e the soul of its false beliefs its seeming knowledge its prejudices It achieves 
this by teaching us to doubt our own convictions 

Fundamentally the same procedure is part of Bacons induction 

IX 

The framework of Bacons theory of induction is this He distinguishes in the Novum Organum 
between a true method and a false method His name for the true method interpretationaturae 
is ordinarily translated by the phrase interpretation of nature and his name for the false 
method anticipatio mentis by anticipation of the mind Obvious as these translations may 
seem they are not adequate What Bacon means by interpretatio naturae is I suggest the 
reading of or better still the spelling out of thebook of Nature  Galileo in a famous passage of 
his Il saggiatore section  of which Mario Bunge has kindly reminded me speaks of that great 
book which lies before our eyesI mean the universe cf Descartes Discourse section  

The term interpretation has in modern English a decidedly subjectivistic or relativistic tinge 
When we speak of Rudolf Serkins interpretation of the Emperor Concerto we imply that there 
are different interpretations but that this one is Serkins We do not of course wish to imply that 
Serkins is not the best the truest the nearest to Beethovens intentions But although we may 
be unable to imagine that there is a better one by using the term interpretation we imply that 
there are other interpretations or readings leaving the question open whether some of these 
other readings may or may not be equally true 

I have here used the word reading as a synonym for interpretation not only because the two 
meanings are so similar but also because reading and to read have suffered a modification 

analogous to that of interpretation and to interpret except that in the case of reading both 
meanings are still in full use In the phrase I have read Johns letter we have the ordinary non
subjectivist meaning But I read this passage of Johns letter quite differently or perhaps My 
reading of this passage is very different may illustrate a later a subjectivistic or relativistic 
meaning of the word reading 

I assert that the meaning of interpret though not in the sense of translate has changed in 
exactly the same way except that the original meaning perhaps reading aloud for those who 
cannot read themselveshas been practically lost Today even the phrase the judge must 
interpret the law means that he has a certain latitude in interpreting it while in Bacons time it 
would have meant that the judge had the duty to read the law as it stood and to 

 

 

expound it and to apply it in the one and only right way Interpretatio juris or legis means either this or 
alternatively the expounding of the law to the layman It leaves the legal interpreter no latitude at any rate no more 
than would be allowed to say a sworn interpreter translating a French legal document 

Thus the translation the interpretation of nature is misleading it should be replaced by something like the true 
reading of nature analogous to the true reading of the law And I suggest that reading the book of Nature as it is 
or better still spelling out the book of Nature is what Bacon meant The point is that the phrase should suggest the 
avoidance of all interpretation in the modern sense and that it should not contain more especially any suggestion of 
an attempt to interpret what is manifest in nature in the light of nonmanifest causes or of hypotheses for all this 
would be an anticipatio mentis in Bacons sense It is a mistake I think to ascribe to Bacon the teaching that 
hypothesesor conjecturesmay result from his method of induction for Baconian induction results in certain 
knowledge rather than in conjecture 

As to the meaning of anticipatio mentis we have only to quote Locke men give themselves up to the first 
anticipations of their minds  Conduct Underst  This is practically a translation from Bacon and it makes it 
amply clear that anticipatio means prejudice or even superstition We can also refer to the phrase anticipatio 
deorum which means harbouring nave or primitive or superstitious views about the gods But to make matters still 
more obvious prejudice cp Descartes Princ i  also derives from a legal term and according to the Oxford 
English Dictionary it was Bacon who introduced the verb to prejudge into the English language in the sense of 
to judge adversely in advancethat is in violation of the judges duty 

Thus the two methods are  the spelling out of the open book of Nature leading to knowledge or epistm and 
 the prejudice of the mind that wrongly prejudges and perhaps misjudges Nature leading to doxa or mere 
guesswork and to the misreading of the book of Nature This latter method rejected by Bacon is in fact a method of 
interpretation in the modern sense of the word It is the method of conjecture or hypothesis a method of 
which incidentally I happen to be a convinced advocate 

How can we prepare ourselves to read the book of Nature properly or truly Bacons answer is by purging our minds 
of all anticipations or conjectures or guesses or prejudices There are various things to be done in order so to purge 
our minds We have to get rid of all sorts of idols or generally held false beliefs for these distort our observations 

But we have also like Socrates to look out for all sorts of counterinstances by which to destroy our prejudices 
concerning the kind of thing whose true essence or nature we wish to ascertain Like Socrates we must by purifying 
our intellects prepare our souls to face the eternal light of essences or natures cf St Augustine Civ Dei VIII  
our impure prejudices must be exorcised by the invocation of counterinstances 

 

 

Only after our souls have been cleansed in this way may we begin the work of spelling out diligently the open book of 
Nature the manifest truth 

In view of all this I suggest that Baconian and also Aristotelian induction is the same fundamentally as Socratic 
maieutic that is to say the preparation of the mind by cleansing it of prejudices in order to enable it to recognize 
the manifest truth or to read the open book of Nature 

Descartes method of systematic doubt is also fundamentally the same it is a method of destroying all false 
prejudices of the mind in order to arrive at the unshakable basis of selfevident truth 

We can now see more clearly how in this optimistic epistemology the state of knowledge is the natural or the pure 
state of man the state of the innocent eye which can see the truth while the state of ignorance has its source in the 
injury suffered by the innocent eye in mans fall from grace an injury which can be partially healed by a course of 
purification And we can see more clearly why this epistemology not only in Descartes but also in Bacons form 
remains essentially a religious doctrine in which the source of all knowledge is divine authority 

One might say that encouraged by the divine essences or divine natures of Plato and by the traditional Greek 
opposition between the truthfulness of nature and the deceitfulness of manmade convention Bacon substitutes in 
his epistemology Nature for God This may be the reason why we have to purify ourselves before we may 
approach the goddess Natura when we have purified our minds even our sometimes unreliable senses held by 
Plato to be hopelessly impure will be pure The sources of knowledge must be kept pure because any impurity may 
become a source of ignorance 

X 

In spite of the religious character of their epistemologies Bacons and Descartes attacks upon prejudice and upon 
traditional beliefs which we carelessly or recklessly harbour are clearly antiauthoritarian and antitraditionalist For 
they require us to shed all beliefs except those whose truth we have perceived ourselves And their attacks were 
certainly intended to be attacks upon authority and tradition They were part of the war against authority which it was 
the fashion of the time to wage the war against the authority of Aristotle and the tradition of the schools Men do not 
need such authorities if they can perceive the truth themselves 

But I do not think that Bacon and Descartes succeeded in freeing their epistemologies from authority not so much 
because they appealed to religious authorityto Nature or to Godbut for an even deeper reason 

In spite of their individualistic tendencies they did not dare to appeal to our critical judgmentto your judgment or to 
mine perhaps because they felt that this might lead to subjectivism and to arbitrariness Yet whatever the reason 

may have been they certainly were unable to give up thinking in terms of authority much as they wanted to do so 
They could only replace one authoritythat of Aristotle and the Bibleby another Each of them 

 

 

appealed to a new authority the one to the authority of the senses and the other to the authority of the 
intellect 

This means that they failed to solve the great problem How can we admit that our knowledge is a humanan all too 
humanaffair without at the same time implying that it is all individual whim and arbitrariness 

Yet this problem had been seen and solved long ago first it appears by Xenophanes and then by Democritus and 
by Socrates the Socrates of the Apology rather than of the Meno The solution lies in the realization that all of us 
may and often do err singly and collectively but that this very idea of error and human fallibility involves another one
the idea of objective truth the standard which we may fall short of Thus the doctrine of fallibility should not be 
regarded as part of a pessimistic epistemology This doctrine implies that we may seek for truth for objective truth 
though more often than not we may miss it by a wide margin And it implies that if we respect truth we must search 
for it by persistently searching for our errors by indefatigable rational criticism and selfcriticism 

Erasmus of Rotterdam attempted to revive this Socratic doctrinethe important though unobtrusive doctrine Know 
thyself and thus admit to thyself how little thou knowest Yet this doctrine was swept away by the belief that truth is 
manifest and by the new selfassurance exemplified and taught in different ways by Luther Bacon and Descartes 

It is important to realize in this connection the difference between Cartesian doubt and the doubt of Socrates or 
Erasmus or Montaigne While Socrates doubts human knowledge or wisdom and remains firm in his rejection of any 
pretension to knowledge or wisdom Descartes doubts everythingbut only to end up with the possession of 
absolutely certain knowledge for he finds that his universal doubt would lead him to doubt the truthfulness of 
God which is absurd Having proved that universal doubt is absurd he concludes that we can know securely that 
we can be wiseby distinguishing in the natural light of reason between clear and distinct ideas whose source is 
God and all the others whose source is our own impure imagination Cartesian doubt we see is merely a maieutic 
instrument for establishing a criterion of truth and with it a way to secure knowledge and wisdom Yet for the 
Socrates of the Apology wisdom consisted in the awareness of our limitations in knowing how little we know every 
one of us 

It was this doctrine of an essential human fallibility which Nicolas of Cusa and Erasmus of Rotterdam who refers to 
Socrates revived and it was this humanist doctrine in contradistinction to the optimistic doctrine on which Milton 
relied the doctrine that truth will prevail which Nicolas and Erasmus Montaigne and Locke and Voltaire followed by 
John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell made the basis of the doctrine of tolerance What is tolerance asks Voltaire 
in his Philosophical Dictionary and he answers It is a necessary consequence of our humanity We are all 
fallible and prone to error let us then pardon each others folly This is the first principle of natural right More 
recently the doctrine of fallibility has been made the basis of a theory 

 

of political freedom that is freedom from coercion See F A Hayek The Constitution of Liberty especially pp 
 and  

XI 

Bacon and Descartes set up observation and reason as new authorities and they set them up within each individual 
man But in doing so they split man into two parts into a higher part which had authority with respect to truth 
Bacons observations Descartes intellectand a lower part It is this lower part which constitutes our ordinary selves 
the old Adam in us For it is always we ourselves who are alone responsible for error if truth is manifest It is we 
with our prejudices our negligence our pigheadedness who are to blame it is we ourselves who are the sources 
of our ignorance 

Thus we are split into a human part we ourselves the part which is the source of our fallible opinions doxa of our 
errors and of our ignorance and a superhuman part such as the senses or the intellect the part which is the source 
of real knowledge epistm and which has an almost divine authority over us 

But this will not do For we know that Descartes physics admirable as it was in many ways was mistaken yet it was 
based only upon ideas which he thought were clear and distinct and which therefore should have been true And 
that the senses were not reliable either and thus had no authority was well known to the ancients for example to 
Heraclitus and Parmenides and Democritus and Plato though hardly to Epicurus 

It is strange that this teaching of antiquity could be almost ignored by modern empiricists including phenomenalists 
and positivists yet it is ignored in most of the problems posed by positivists and phenomenalists and in the solutions 
they offer The reason is this they still believe that it is not our senses that err but that it is always we ourselves who 
err in our interpretation of what is given to us by our senses Our senses tell the truth but we may err for 
example when we try to put into languageconventional manmade imperfect languagewhat they tell 
us It is our linguistic description which is faulty because it may be tinged with prejudice 

So our manmade language was at fault But then it was discovered that our language too was given to us in an 
important sense that it embodied the wisdom and experience of many generations and that it should not be blamed 
if we misused it So language too became a truthful authority that could never deceive us If we fall into temptation 
and use language in vain then it is we who are to blame for the trouble that ensues For language is a jealous God 
and will not hold him guiltless that taketh His words in vain but will throw him into darkness and confusion 

By blaming us and our language or misuse of language it is possible to uphold the divine authority of the senses 
and even of language But it is possible only at the cost of widening the gap between this authority and ourselves 
between the pure sources from which we can obtain an authoritative knowledge of the truthful goddess Nature and 
our impure and guilty selves 

 

 

 

between God and man As indicated before this idea of the truthfulness of Nature which I believe can be discerned 
in Bacon derives from the Greeks for it is part of the classical opposition between nature and human convention 
which according to Plato is due to Pindar which may be discerned in Parmenides and which is identified by him 
and by some sophists for example by Hippias and partly also by Plato himself with the opposition between divine 
truth and human error or even falsehood After Bacon and under his influence the idea that nature is divine and 
truthful and that all error or falsehood is due to the deceitfulness of our own human conventions continued to play a 
major role not only in the history of philosophy of science and of politics but also in that of the visual arts This may 
be seen for example from Constables most interesting theories on nature veracity prejudice and convention 
quoted in E H Gombrich Art and Illusion It has also played a role in the history of literature and even in that of 
music

Can the strange view that the truth of a statement may be decided upon by inquiring into its sourcesthat is to say its 
originbe explained as due to some logical mistake which might be cleared up Or can we do no better than explain 
it in terms of religious beliefs or in psychological termsreferring perhaps to parental authority I believe that it is 
indeed possible to discern here a logical mistake which is connected with the close analogy between the meaning 
of our words or terms or concepts and the truth of our statements or propositions 

It is easy to see that the meaning of our words does have some connection with their history or their origin A word is 
logically considered a conventional sign psychologically considered it is a sign whose meaning is established by 
usage or custom or association Logically considered its meaning is indeed established by an initial decision
something like a primary definition or convention a kind of original social contract and psychologically considered its 
meaning was established when we originally learned to use it when we first formed our linguistic habits and 
associations Thus there is a point in the complaint of the schoolboy about the unnecessary artificiality of French in 
which pain means bread while English he feels is so much more natural and straightforward in calling pain pain 
and bread bread He may understand the conventionality of the usage perfectly well but he gives expression to the 
feeling that there is no reason why the original conventionsoriginal for himshould not be binding So his mistake 
may consist merely in forgetting that there can be several equally binding original conventions But who has not 
made implicitly the same mistake Most of us have caught ourselves in a feeling of surprise when we find that in 
France even little children speak French fluently Of course we smile about our own navety but we do not smile 
about the policeman who discovers that the real name of the man called  Samuel Jones was  John Smith
though here is no 

 

 

doubt a last vestige of the magical belief that we gain power over a man or a god by gaining knowledge of his real 
name 

Thus there is indeed a familiar as well as a logically defensible sense in which the true or proper meaning of a term 
is its original meaning so that if we understand it we do so because we learned it correctlyfrom a true authority 
from one who knew the language This shows that the problem of the meaning of a word is indeed linked to the 
problem of the authoritative source or the origin of our usage 

It is different with the problem of the truth of a statement of fact a proposition For anybody can make a factual 
mistakeeven in matters on which he should be an authority such as his own age or the colour of a thing which he 
has just this moment clearly and distinctly perceived And as to origins a statement may easily have been false when 
it was first made and first properly understood A word on the other hand must have had a proper meaning as soon 
as it was ever understood 

If we thus reflect upon the difference between the ways in which the meaning of words and the truth of statements is 
related to their origins we are hardly tempted to think that the question of origin can have much bearing on the 
question of knowledge or of truth There is however a deep analogy between meaning and truth and there is a 
philosophical viewI have called it essentialismwhich tries to link meaning and truth so closely that the temptation 
to treat both in the same way becomes almost irresistible 

In order to explain this briefly we may first contemplate the table on p  noting the relation between its two sides 

How are the two sides of this table connected If we look at the left side of the table we find there the word 
Definitions But a definition is a kind of statement or judgment or proposition and therefore one of those 
things which stand on the right side of our table This fact incidentally does not spoil the symmetry of the table for 
derivations are also things that transcend the kind of thingsstatements etcwhich stand on the side where the 
word derivation occurs just as a definition is formulated by a special kind of sequence of words rather than by a 
word so a derivation is formulated by a special kind of sequence of statements rather than by a statement The 
fact that definitions which occur on the left side of our table are nevertheless statements suggests that somehow 
they may form a link between the left and the right side of the table 

That they do this is indeed part of that philosophic doctrine to which I have given the name essentialism According 
to essentialism especially Aristotles version of it a definition is a statement of the inherent essence or nature of a 
thing At the same time it states the meaning of a wordof the name that designates the essence For example 
Descartes and also Kant hold that the word body designates something that is essentially extended 

Moreover Aristotle and all other essentialists held that definitions are principles that is to say they yield 
primitive propositions example All 

 

 

bodies are extended which cannot be derived from other propositions and which form the basis or are part of the 
basis of every demonstration They thus form the basis of every science Cf my Open Society especially notes 
 to  to chapter  It should be noted that this particular tenet though an important part of the essentialist creed 
is free of any reference to essences This explains why it was accepted by some nominalistic opponents of 
essentialism such as Hobbes or say Schlick See the latters Erkenntnislehre nd edition  p  

I think we have now the means at our disposal by which we can explain the logic of the view that 
questions of origin may decide questions of factual 

truth For if origins can determine the true meaning of a term or word then they can determine 
the true definition of an important idea and therefore some at least of the basic principles 
which are descriptions of the essences or natures of things and which underlie our 
demonstrations and consequently our scientific knowledge So it will then appear that there are 
authoritative sources of our knowledge 

Yet we must realize that essentialism is mistaken in suggesting that definitions can add to our 
knowledge of facts although qua decisions about conventions they may be influenced by our 
knowledge of facts and although they create instruments which may in their turn influence the 
formation of our theories and thereby the evolution of our knowledge of facts Once we see that 

 

definitions never give any factual knowledge about nature or about 

 

 

the nature of things we also see the break in the logical link between the problem of origin and that of factual truth 
which some essentialist philosophers tried to forge 

XIII 

I will now leave all these largely historical reflections aside and turn to the problems themselves and to their solution 

This part of my lecture might be described as an attack on empiricism as formulated for example in the following 
classical statement of Humes If I ask you why you believe any particular matter of fact   you must tell me some 
reason and this reason will be some other fact connected with it But as you cannot proceed after this manner in 
infinitum you must at last terminate in some fact which is present to your memory or senses or must allow that 
your belief is entirely without foundation  Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding Section V Part I 
SelbyBigge p   see also my motto taken from Section vii Part I p  

The problem of the validity of empiricism may be roughly put as follows is observation the ultimate source of our 
knowledge of nature And if not what are the sources of our knowledge 

These questions remain whatever I may have said about Bacon and even if I should have managed to make those 
parts of his philosophy on which I have commented somewhat unattractive for Baconians and for other empiricists 

The problem of the source of our knowledge has recently been restated as follows If we make an assertion we must 
justify it but this means that we must be able to answer the following questions 

How do you know What are the sources of your assertion 

This the empiricist holds amounts in its turn to the question 

What observations or memories of observations underlie your assertion 

I find this string of questions quite unsatisfactory 

First of all most of our assertions are not based upon observations but upon all kinds of other sources I read it in 
The Times or perhaps I read it in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is a more likely and a more definite answer 
to the question How do you know than I have observed it or I know it from an observation I made last year 

But the empiricist will reply how do you think that The Times or the Encyclopaedia Britannica got their 
information Surely if you only carry on your inquiry long enough you will end up with reports of the 
observations of eyewitnesses sometimes called protocol sentences orby yourselfbasic statements 
Admittedly the empiricist will continue books are largely made from other books Admittedly a historian for 

example will work from documents But ultimately in the last analysis these other books or these documents must 
have been based upon observations Otherwise they would have to be described as poetry or invention or lies but 
not as testimony It is in this sense that we empiricists assert that observation must be the ultimate source of our 
knowledge 

 

 

Here we have the empiricists case as it is still put by some of my positivist friends 

I shall try to show that this case is as little valid as Bacons that the answer to the question of the sources of 
knowledge goes against the empiricist and finally that this whole question of ultimate sourcessources to which one 
may appeal as one might to a higher court or a higher authoritymust be rejected as based upon a mistake 

First I want to show that if you actually went on questioning The Times and its correspondents about the sources of 
their knowledge you would in fact never arrive at all those observations by eyewitnesses in the existence of which 
the empiricist believes You would find rather that with every single step you take the need for further steps 
increases in snowballlike fashion 

Take as an example the sort of assertion for which reasonable people might simply accept as sufficient the answer I 
read it in The Times let us say the assertion The Prime Minister has decided to return to London several days 
ahead of schedule Now assume for a moment that somebody doubts this assertion or feels the need to investigate 
its truth What shall he do If he has a friend in the Prime Ministers office the simplest and most direct way would be 
to ring him up and if this friend corroborates the message then that is that 

In other words the investigator will if possible try to check or to examine the asserted fact itself rather than 
trace the source of the information But according to the empiricist theory the assertion I have read it in The 
Times is merely a first step in a justification procedure consisting in tracing the ultimate source What is the next 
step 

There are at least two next steps One would be to reflect that I have read it in The Times is also an assertion and 
that we might ask What is the source of your knowledge that you read it in The Times and not say in a paper 
looking very similar to The Times The other is to ask The Times for the sources of its knowledge The answer 
to the first question may be But we have only The Times on order and we always get it in the morning which gives 
rise to a host of further questions about sources which we shall not pursue The second question may elicit from the 
editor of The Times the answer We had a telephone call from the Prime Ministers Office Now according to the 
empiricist procedure we should at this stage ask next Who is the gentleman who received the telephone call and 
then get his observation report but we should also have to ask that gentleman What is the source of your 
knowledge that the voice you heard came from an official in the Prime Ministers office and so on 

There is a simple reason why this tedious sequence of questions never comes to a satisfactory conclusion It is this 
Every witness must always make ample use in his report of his knowledge of persons places things linguistic 
usages social conventions and so on He cannot rely merely upon his eyes or ears especially if his report is to be of 
use in justifying any assertion worth 

 

 

justifying But this fact must of course always raise new questions as to the sources of those elements of his 
knowledge which are not immediately observational 

This is why the programme of tracing back all knowledge to its ultimate source in observation is logically impossible 
to carry through it leads to an infinite regress The doctrine that truth is manifest cuts off the regress This is 
interesting because it may help to explain the attractiveness of that doctrine 

I wish to mention in parenthesis that this argument is closely related to anotherthat all observation involves 
interpretation in the light of our theoretical knowledge  or that pure observational knowledge unadulterated by 
theory would if at all possible be utterly barren and futile 

The most striking thing about the observationalist programme of asking for sourcesapart from its tediousnessis its 
stark violation of common sense For if we are doubtful about an assertion then the normal procedure is to test it 
rather than to ask for its sources and if we find independent corroboration then we shall often accept the assertion 
without bothering at all about sources 

Of course there are cases in which the situation is different Testing an historical assertion always means going 
back to sources but not as a rule to the reports of eyewitnesses 

Clearly no historian will accept the evidence of documents uncritically There are problems of genuineness there are 
problems of bias and there are also such problems as the reconstruction of earlier sources There are of course 
also problems such as was the writer present when these events happened But this is not one of the characteristic 
problems of the historian He may worry about the reliability of a report but he will rarely worry about whether or not 
the writer of a document was an eyewitness of the event in question even assuming that this event was of the nature 
of an observable event A letter saying I changed my mind yesterday on this question may be most valuable 
historical evidence even though changes of mind are unobservable and even though we may conjecture in view of 
other evidence that the writer was lying 

As to eyewitnesses they are important almost exclusively in a court of law where they can be crossexamined As 
most lawyers know eyewitnesses often err This has been experimentally investigated with the most striking results 
Witnesses most anxious to describe an event as it happened are liable to make scores of mistakes especially if 
some exciting things happen in a hurry and if an event suggests some tempting interpretation then this 
interpretation more often than not is allowed to distort what has actually been seen 

Humes view of historical knowledge was different    we believe he writes in the Treatise Book I Part III 
Section iv SelbyBigge p   that 

 

 See my Logic of Scientific Discovery last paragraph of section  and new appendix x  

 

Caesar was killd in the Senatehouse on the ides of March   because this fact is establishd on the unanimous 
testimony of historians who agree to assign this precise time and place to that event Here are certain characters and 
letters present either to our memory or senses which characters we likewise remember to have been usd as the 
signs of certain ideas and these ideas were either in the minds of such as were immediately present at that action 
and receivd the ideas directly from its existence or they were derivd from the testimony of others and that again 
from another testimony   till we arrive at those who were eyewitnesses and spectators of the event See also 
Enquiry Section x SelbyBigge pp  ff 

It seems to me that this view must lead to the infinite regress described above For the problem is of course whether 
the unanimous testimony of historians is to be accepted or whether it is perhaps to be rejected as the result of their 
reliance on a common yet spurious source The appeal to letters present to our memory or our senses cannot have 
any bearing on this or on any other relevant problem of historiography

But what then are the sources of our knowledge 

The answer I think is this there are all kinds of sources of our knowledge but none has authority 

We may say that The Times can be a source of knowledge or the Encyclopaedia Britannica We may say 
that certain papers in the Physical Review about a problem in physics have more authority and are more of the 
character of a source than an article about the same problem in The Times or the Encyclopaedia But it would 
be quite wrong to say that the source of the article in the Physical Review must have been wholly or even partly 
observation The source may well be the discovery of an inconsistency in another paper or say the discovery of the 
fact that a hypothesis proposed in another paper could be tested by such and such an experiment all these non
observational discoveries are sources in the sense that they all add to our knowledge 

I do not of course deny that an experiment may also add to our knowledge and in a most important manner But it is 
not a source in any ultimate sense It has always to be checked as in the example of the news in The Times we do 
not as a rule question the eyewitness of an experiment but if we doubt the result we may repeat the experiment or 
ask somebody else to repeat it 

The fundamental mistake made by the philosophical theory of the ultimate sources of our knowledge is that it does 
not distinguish clearly enough between questions of origin and questions of validity Admittedly in the case of 
historiography these two questions may sometimes coincide The question of the validity of an historical assertion 
may be testable only or mainly in the light of the origin of certain sources But in general the two questions are 
different and in general we do not test the validity of an assertion or information by tracing its sources or its origin 
but we test it 

 

 

 

much more directly by a critical examination of what has been assertedof the asserted facts themselves 

Thus the empiricists questions How do you know What is the source of your assertion are wrongly put They are 
not formulated in an inexact or slovenly manner but they are entirely misconceived they are questions that 
beg for an authoritarian answer 

XV 

The traditional systems of epistemology may be said to result from yesanswers or noanswers to questions about the 
sources of knowledge They never challenge these questions or dispute their legitimacy the questions 
are taken as perfectly natural and nobody seems to see any harm in them 

This is quite interesting for these questions are clearly authoritarian in spirit They can be compared with that 
traditional question of political theory Who should rule which begs for an authoritarian answer such as the best 
or the wisest or the people or the majority It suggests incidentally such silly alternatives as Whom do you want 
as rulers the capitalists or the workers analogous to What is the ultimate source of knowledge the intellect or the 
senses This political question is wrongly put and the answers which it elicits are paradoxical as I have tried to 
show in chapter  of my Open Society It should be replaced by a completely different question such as How 
can we organize our political institutions so that bad or incompetent rulers whom we should try not to 
get but whom we so easily might get all the same cannot do too much damage I believe that only by 
changing our question in this way can we hope to proceed towards a reasonable theory of political institutions 

The question about the sources of our knowledge can be replaced in a similar way It has always been asked in the 
spirit of What are the best sources of our knowledgethe most reliable ones those which will not lead us into error 
and those to which we can and must turn in case of doubt as the last court of appeal I propose to assume instead 
that no such ideal sources existno more than ideal rulersand that all sources are liable to lead us into error at 
times And I propose to replace therefore the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different 
question How can we hope to detect and eliminate error 

The question of the sources of our knowledge like so many authoritarian questions is a genetic one It asks for the 
origin of our knowledge in the belief that knowledge may legitimize itself by its pedigree The nobility of the racially 
pure knowledge the untainted knowledge the knowledge which derives from the highest authority if possible from 
God these are the often unconscious metaphysical ideas behind the question My modified question How can we 
hope to detect error may be said to derive from the view that such pure untainted and certain sources do not exist 
and that questions of origin or of purity should not be confounded with questions of validity or of truth This view may 
be said to be as old as Xenophanes Xenophanes knew 

 

 

that our knowledge is guesswork opiniondoxa rather than epistmas shown by his verses DK B  and  

The gods did not reveal from the beginning All things to us but in the course of time Through 
seeking men find that which is the better 

But as for certain truth no man has known it Nor will he know it neither of the gods Nor yet of all the 
things of which I speak And even if by chance he were to utter The final truth he would himself not 
know it For all is but a woven web of guesses 

Yet the traditional question of the authoritative sources of knowledge is repeated even todayand very often by 
positivists and by other philosophers who believe themselves to be in revolt against authority 

The proper answer to my question How can we hope to detect and eliminate error is I believe By criticizing the 
theories or guesses of others andif we can train ourselves to do soby criticizing our own theories or guesses The 
latter point is highly desirable but not indispensable for if we fail to criticize our own theories there may be others to 
do it for us This answer sums up a position which I propose to call critical rationalism It is a view an attitude and a 
tradition which we owe to the Greeks It is very different from the rationalism or intellectualism of Descartes and his 
school and very different even from the epistemology of Kant Yet in the field of ethics of moral knowledge it was 
approached by Kant with his principle of autonomy This principle expresses his realization that we must not 
accept the command of an authority however exalted as the basis of ethics For whenever we are faced with a 
command by an authority it is for us to judge critically whether it is moral or immoral to obey The authority may 
have power to enforce its commands and we may be powerless to resist But if we have the physical power of 
choice then the ultimate responsibility remains with us It is our own critical decision whether to obey a command 
whether to submit to an authority 

Kant boldly carried this idea into the field of religion    in whatever way he writes the Deity should be made 
known to you and even    if He should reveal Himself to you it is you    who must judge whether you are 
permitted to believe in Him and to worship Him  

In view of this bold statement it seems strange that Kant did not adopt the same attitudethat of critical examination 
of the critical search for errorin the field of science I feel certain that it was only his acceptance of the authority of 
Newtons cosmologya result of its almost unbelievable success in passing the most severe testswhich prevented 
Kant from doing 

 

 See Immanuel Kant Religion Within the Limits of Pure Reason nd edition   Fourth Chapter 
Part II   the first footnote The passage is quoted more fully in ch  of the present volume text to note  

 

 

so If this interpretation of Kant is correct then the critical rationalism and also the critical empiricism which I 
advocate merely puts the finishing touch to Kants own critical philosophy And this was made possible by Einstein 
who taught us that Newtons theory may well be mistaken in spite of its overwhelming successSo my answer to the 
questions How do you knowWhat is the source or the basis of your assertionWhat observations have led you to 
it would be I do not know my assertion was merely a guess Never mind the source or the sources from which it 
may springthere are many possible sources and I may not be aware of half of them and origins or pedigrees have 
in any case little bearing upon truth But if you are interested in the problem which I tried to solve by my tentative 
assertion you may help me by criticizing it as severely as you can and if you can design some experimental test 
which you think might refute my assertion I shall gladly and to the best of my powers help you to refute itThis 
answer  applies strictly speaking only if the question is asked about some scientific assertion as distinct from an 
historical one If my conjecture was an historical one sources in the nonultimate sense will of course come into the 
critical discussion of its validity Yet fundamentally my answer will be the same as we have seen 
XVI 
It is high time now I think to formulate the epistemological results of this discussion I will put them in the form of nine 
theses 
 

There are no ultimate sources of knowledge Every source every suggestion is welcome and every source 
every suggestion is open to critical examination Except in history we usually examine the facts themselves 
rather than the sources of our information 
The proper epistemological question is not one about sources rather we ask whether the assertion made is 
truethat is to say whether it agrees with the facts That we may operate without getting involved in 
antinomies with the idea of objective truth in the sense of correspondence to the facts has been shown by the 
work of Alfred Tarski And we try to find this out as well as we can by examining or testing the assertion itself 
either in a direct way or by examining or testing its consequences 
In connection with this examination all kinds of arguments may be relevant A typical procedure is to examine 
whether our theories are consistent with our observations But we may also examine for example whether our 
historical sources are mutually and internally consistent 

 

 

  Quantitatively and qualitatively by far the most important source of our knowledgeapart from inborn 

knowledgeis tradition Most things we know we have learned by example by being told by reading books by 

 
 This answer and almost the whole of the contents of the present section xv are taken with only minor changes 
from a paper of mine which was first published in The Indian Journal of Philosophy  No   

 

 

learning how to criticize how to take and to accept criticism how to respect truth 
The fact that most of the sources of our knowledge are traditional condemns antitraditionalism as futile But 
this fact must not be held to support a traditionalist attitude every bit of our traditional knowledge and even our 
inborn knowledge is open to critical examination and may be overthrown Nevertheless without tradition 
knowledge would be impossible 
Knowledge cannot start from nothingfrom a tabula rasanor yet from observation The advance of 
knowledge consists mainly in the modification of earlier knowledge Although we may sometimes for example 
in archaeology advance through a chance observation the significance of the discovery will usually depend 
upon its power to modify our earlier theories 
Pessimistic and optimistic epistemologies are about equally mistaken The pessimistic cave story of Plato is the 
true one and not his optimistic story of anamnsis even though we should admit that all men like all other 
animals and even all plants possess inborn knowledge But although the world of appearances is indeed a 
world of mere shadows on the walls of our cave we all constantly reach out beyond it and although as 
Democritus said the truth is hidden in the deep we can probe into the deep There is no criterion of truth at our 
disposal and this fact supports pessimism But we do possess criteria which if we are lucky may allow us 
to recognize error and falsity Clarity and distinctness are not criteria of truth but such things as obscurity or 
confusion may indicate error Similarly coherence cannot establish truth but incoherence and inconsistency do 
establish falsehood And when they are recognized our own errors provide the dim red lights which help us in 
groping our way out of the darkness of our cave 
Neither observation nor reason are authorities Intellectual intuition and imagination are most important but 
they are not reliable they may show us things very clearly and yet they may mislead us They are 
indispensable as the main sources of our theories but most of our theories are false anyway The most 
important function of observation and reasoning and even of intuition and imagination is to help us in the 
critical examination of those bold conjectures which are the means by which we probe into the unknown 
Every solution of a problem raises new unsolved problems the more so the deeper the original problem and 
the bolder its solution The more we learn about the world and the deeper our learning the more conscious 
specific and articulate will be our knowledge of what we do not know our knowledge of our ignorance For this 
indeed is the main source of our ignorancethe fact that our knowledge can be only finite while our ignorance 
must necessarily be infinite 

We may get a glimpse of the vastness of our ignorance when we contemplate the vastness of the heavens though 
the mere size of the universe is not the deepest cause of our ignorance it is one of its causes Where I seem to differ 
from some of my friends F P Ramsey wrote in a charming passage of his Foundations of Mathematics p 
  is in attaching little importance to 

 

 

physical size I dont feel in the least humble before the vastness of the heavens The stars may be large but they 
cannot think or love and these are qualities which impress me far more than size does I take no credit for weighing 
nearly seventeen stone I suspect that Ramseys friends would have agreed with him about the insignificance of 
sheer physical size and I suspect that if they felt humble before the vastness of the heavens this was because they 
saw in it a symbol of their ignorance 

I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely 
learn that we do not know much This state of learned ignorance might be a help in many of our troubles It might be 
well for all of us to remember that while differing widely in the various little bits we know in our infinite ignorance we 
are all equal 

XVII 

There is a last question I wish to raise 

If only we look for it we can often find a true idea worthy of being preserved in a philosophical theory which must be 
rejected as false Can we find an idea like this in one of the theories of the ultimate sources of our knowledge 

I believe we can and I suggest that it is one of the two main ideas which underlie the doctrine that the source of all 
our knowledge is supernatural The first of these ideas is false I believe while the second is true 

The first the false idea is that we must justify our knowledge or our theories by positive reasons that is by 
reasons capable of establishing them or at least of making them highly probable at any rate by better reasons than 
that they have so far withstood criticism This idea implies I suggested that we must appeal to some ultimate or 
authoritative source of true knowledge which still leaves open the character of that authoritywhether it is human 
like observation or reason or superhuman and therefore supernatural 

The second ideawhose vital importance has been stressed by Russellis that no mans authority can establish truth 
by decree that we should submit to truth that truth is above human authority 

Taken together these two ideas almost immediately yield the conclusion that the sources from which our knowledge 
derives must be superhuman a conclusion which tends to encourage selfrighteousness and the use of force 
against those who refuse to see the divine truth 

Some who rightly reject this conclusion do not unhappily reject the first ideathe belief in the existence of ultimate 
sources of knowledge Instead they reject the second ideathe thesis that truth is above human authority They 
thereby endanger the idea of the objectivity of knowledge and of common standards of criticism or rationality 

What we should do I suggest is to give up the idea of ultimate sources of knowledge and admit that all knowledge is 
human that it is mixed with our errors our prejudices our dreams and our hopes that all we can do is to 

 

 

 

 

 

grope for truth even though it be beyond our reach We may admit that our groping is often inspired but we must be 
on our guard against the belief however deeply felt that our inspiration carries any authority divine or otherwise If 
we thus admit that there is no authority beyond the reach of criticism to be found within the whole province of our 
knowledge however far it may have penetrated into the unknown then we can retain without danger the idea that 
truth is beyond human authority And we must retain it For without this idea there can be no objective standards of 
inquiry no criticism of our conjectures no groping for the unknown no quest for knowledge

SCIENCE CONJECTURES AND REFUTATIONS 

Mr Turnbull had predicted evil consequences    and was now doing the best in his power to bring 
about the verification of his own prophecies 

ANTHONY TROLLOPE 

I 

WHEN I received the list of participants in this course and realized that I had been asked to speak to philosophical 
colleagues I thought after some hesitation and consultation that you would probably prefer me to speak about those 
problems which interest me most and about those developments with which I am most intimately acquainted I 
therefore decided to do what I have never done before to give you a report on my own work in the philosophy of 
science since the autumn of  when I first began to grapple with the problem When should a theory be 
ranked as scientific or Is there a criterion for the scientific character or status of a theory 

The problem which troubled me at the time was neither When is a theory true nor When is a theory acceptable 
My problem was different I wished to distinguish between science and pseudoscience knowing very 

well that science often errs and that pseudoscience may happen to stumble on the truth 

I knew of course the most widely accepted answer to my problem that science is distinguished from pseudo
scienceor from metaphysicsby its empirical method which is essentially inductive proceeding from 
observation or experiment But this did not satisfy me On the contrary I often formulated my problem as one of 
distinguishing between a genuinely empirical method and a nonempirical or even a pseudoempirical methodthat is 
to say a method which although it appeals to observation and experiment nevertheless 

 

 

does not come up to scientific standards The latter method may be exemplified by astrology with its stupendous 
mass of empirical evidence based on observationon horoscopes and on biographies 

But as it was not the example of astrology which led me to my problem I should perhaps briefly describe the 
atmosphere in which my problem arose and the examples by which it was stimulated After the collapse of the 
Austrian Empire there had been a revolution in Austria the air was full of revolutionary slogans and ideas and new 
and often wild theories Among the theories which interested me Einsteins theory of relativity was no doubt by far the 
most important Three others were Marxs theory of history Freuds psychoanalysis and Alfred Adlers socalled 
individual psychology 

There was a lot of popular nonsense talked about these theories and especially about relativity as still happens 
even today but I was fortunate in those who introduced me to the study of this theory We allthe small circle of 
students to which I belongedwere thrilled with the result of Eddingtons eclipse observations which in  brought 
the first important confirmation of Einsteins theory of gravitation It was a great experience for us and one which had 
a lasting influence on my intellectual development 

The three other theories I have mentioned were also widely discussed among students at that time I myself 
happened to come into personal contact with Alfred Adler and even to cooperate with him in his social work among 
the children and young people in the workingclass districts of Vienna where he had established social guidance 
clinics 

It was during the summer of  that I began to feel more and more dissatisfied with these three theoriesthe 
Marxist theory of history psychoanalysis and individual psychology and I began to feel dubious about their claims to 
scientific status My problem perhaps first took the simple form What is wrong with Marxism psychoanalysis and 
individual psychology Why are they so different from physical theories from Newtons theory and especially from 
the theory of relativity 

To make this contrast clear I should explain that few of us at the time would have said that we believed in the truth of 
Einsteins theory of gravitation This shows that it was not my doubting the truth of those other three theories which 
bothered me but something else Yet neither was it that I merely felt mathematical physics to be more exact than 
the sociological or psychological type of theory Thus what worried me was neither the problem of truth at that stage 
at least nor the problem of exactness or measurability It was rather that I felt that these other three theories though 
posing as sciences had in fact more in common with primitive myths than with science that they resembled astrology 
rather than astronomy 

I found that those of my friends who were admirers of Marx Freud and Adler were impressed by a number of points 
common to these theories and especially by their apparent explanatory power These theories appeared to be 
able to explain practically everything that happened within the fields to which they referred The study of any of them 
seemed to have the effect of an 

 

intellectual conversion or revelation opening your eyes to a new truth hidden from those not yet initiated Once your 
eyes were thus opened you saw confirming instances everywhere the world was full of verifications of the theory 
Whatever happened always confirmed it Thus its truth appeared manifest and unbelievers were clearly people who 
did not want to see the manifest truth who refused to see it either because it was against their class interest or 
because of their repressions which were still unanalysed and crying aloud for treatment 

The most characteristic element in this situation seemed to me the incessant stream of confirmations of observations 
which verified the theories in question and this point was constantly emphasized by their adherents A Marxist could 
not open a newspaper without finding on every page confirming evidence for his interpretation of history not only in 
the news but also in its presentationwhich revealed the class bias of the paperand especially of course in what the 
paper did not say The Freudian analysts emphasized that their theories were constantly verified by their clinical 
observations As for Adler I was much impressed by a personal experience Once in  I reported to him a case 
which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian but which he found no difficulty in analysing in terms of his theory of 
inferiority feelings although he had not even seen the child Slightly shocked I asked him how he could be so sure 
Because of my thousandfold experience he replied whereupon I could not help saying And with this new case I 
suppose your experience has become thousandandonefold 

What I had in mind was that his previous observations may not have been much sounder than this new one that 
each in its turn had been interpreted in the light of previous experience and at the same time counted as additional 
confirmation What I asked myself did it confirm No more than that a case could be interpreted in the light of the 
theory But this meant very little I reflected since every conceivable case could be interpreted in the light of Adlers 
theory or equally of Freuds I may illustrate this by two very different examples of human behaviour that of a man 
who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an 
attempt to save the child Each of these two cases can be explained with equal ease in Freudian and in Adlerian 
terms According to Freud the first man suffered from repression say of some component of his Oedipus complex 
while the second man had achieved sublimation According to Adler the first man suffered from feelings of inferiority 
producing perhaps the need to prove to himself that he dared to commit some crime and so did the second man 
whose need was to prove to himself that he dared to rescue the child I could not think of any human behaviour 
which could not be interpreted in terms of either theory It was precisely this factthat they always fitted that they 
were always confirmedwhich in the eyes of their admirers constituted the strongest argument in favour of these 
theories It began to dawn on me that this apparent strength was in fact their weakness 

With Einsteins theory the situation was strikingly different Take one 

 

 

 

typical instance Einsteins prediction just then confirmed by the findings of Eddingtons expedition Einsteins 
gravitational theory had led to the result that light must be attracted by heavy bodies such as the sun precisely as 
material bodies were attracted As a consequence it could be calculated that light from a distant fixed star whose 
apparent position was close to the sun would reach the earth from such a direction that the star would seem to be 
slightly shifted away from the sun or in other words that stars close to the sun would look as if they had moved a 
little away from the sun and from one another This is a thing which cannot normally be observed since such star are 
rendered invisible in daytime by the suns overwhelming brightness but during an eclipse it is possible to take 
photographs of them If the same constellation is photographed at night one can measure the distances on the two 
photographs and check the predicted effectNow the impressive thing about this case is the risk involved in a 
prediction of this kind If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent then the theory is simply 
refuted The theory is incompatible with certain possible results of observationin fact with results which 
everybody before Einstein would have expected  This is quite different from the situation I have previously 
described when it turned out that the theories in question were compatible with the most divergent human behaviour 
so that it was practically impossible to describe any human behaviour that might not be claimed to be a verification of 
these theoriesThese considerations led me in the winter of  to conclusions which I may now reformulate as 
follows 
 
 

It is easy to obtain confirmations or verifications for nearly every theoryif we look for confirmations 
Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions that is to say if unenlightened by 
the theory in question we should have expected an event which was incompatible with the theoryan event 
which would have refuted the theory 
Every good scientific theory is a prohibition it forbids certain things to happen The more a theory forbids the 
better it is 
A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is nonscientific Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory 
as people often think but a vice 
Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it or to refute it Testability is falsifiability but there are 
degrees of testability some theories are more testable more exposed to refutation than others they take as it 
were greater risks 
Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory 
and this means that it can be presented as a serious but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory I now 
speak in such cases of corroborating evidence 

 

 

 

 

 

 This is a slight oversimplification for about half of the Einstein effect may be derived from the classical theory 
provided we assume a ballistic theory of light 

 

 

 

Some genuinely testable theories when found to be false are still upheld by their admirersfor example by 
introducing ad hoc some auxiliary assumption or by reinterpreting the theory ad hoc in such a way that it 
escapes refutation Such a procedure is always possible but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the 
price of destroying or at least lowering its scientific status I later described such a rescuing operation as a 
conventionalist twist or a conventionalist stratagem 

One can sum up all this by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability 
or refutability or testability 

II 

I may perhaps exemplify this with the help of the various theories so far mentioned Einsteins theory of gravitation 
clearly satisfied the criterion of falsifiability Even if our measuring instruments at the time did not allow us to 
pronounce on the results of the tests with complete assurance there was clearly a possibility of refuting the theory 

Astrology did not pass the test Astrologers were greatly impressed and misled by what they believed to be 
confirming evidenceso much so that they were quite unimpressed by any unfavourable evidence Moreover by 
making their interpretations and prophecies sufficiently vague they were able to explain away anything that might 
have been a refutation of the theory had the theory and the prophecies been more precise In order to escape 
falsification they destroyed the testability of their theory It is a typical soothsayers trick to predict things so vaguely 
that the predictions can hardly fail that they become irrefutable 

The Marxist theory of history in spite of the serious efforts of some of its founders and followers ultimately adopted 
this soothsaying practice In some of its earlier formulations for example in Marxs analysis of the character of the 
coming social revolution their predictions were testable and in fact falsified  Yet instead of accepting the 
refutations the followers of Marx reinterpreted both the theory and the evidence in order to make them agree In this 
way they rescued the theory from refutation but they did so at the price of adopting a device which made it 
irrefutable They thus gave a conventionalist twist to the theory and by this stratagem they destroyed its much 
advertised claim to scientific status 

The two psychoanalytic theories were in a different class They were simply nontestable irrefutable There was no 
conceivable human behaviour which could contradict them This does not mean that Freud and Adler were not seeing 
certain things correctly I personally do not doubt that much of what they say is of considerable importance and may 
well play its part one day in a psychological science which is testable But it does mean that those clinical 
observations which analysts navely believe confirm their theory cannot do this any more than the daily confirmations 
which astrologers find 

 

 See for example my Open Society and Its Enemies ch  section iii and notes  

 

 

in their practice  And as for Freuds epic of the Ego the Superego and the Id no substantially stronger claim to 
scientific status can be made for it than for Homers collected stories from Olympus These theories describe some 
facts but in the manner of myths They contain most interesting psychological suggestions but not in a testable form 

At the same time I realized that such myths may be developed and become testable that historically speaking allor 
very nearly allscientific theories originate from myths and that a myth may contain important anticipations of 
scientific theories Examples are Empedocles theory of evolution by trial and error or Parmenides myth of the 
unchanging block universe in which nothing ever happens and which if we add another dimension becomes 
Einsteins block universe in which too nothing ever happens since everything is fourdimensionally speaking 
determined and laid down from the beginning I thus felt that if a theory is found to be nonscientific or 
metaphysical as we might say it is not thereby found to be unimportant or insignificant or meaningless or 
nonsensical  But it cannot claim to be backed by empirical evidence in the scientific sensealthough it may easily 
be in some genetic sense the result of observation 

There were a great many other theories of this prescientific or pseudo 

 

 Clinical observations like all other observations are interpretations in the light of theories see below 
sections iv ff and for this reason alone they are apt to seem to support those theories in the light of which they 
were interpreted But real support can be obtained only from observations undertaken as tests by attempted 
refutations and for this purpose criteria of refutation have to be laid down beforehand it must be agreed 
which observable situations if actually observed mean that the theory is refuted But what kind of clinical 
responses would refute to the satisfaction of the analyst not merely a particular analytic diagnosis but psycho
analysis itself And have such criteria ever been discussed or agreed upon by analysts Is there not on the 
contrary a whole family of analytic concepts such as ambivalence I do not suggest that there is no such thing 
as ambivalence which would make it difficult if not impossible to agree upon such criteria Moreover how 
much headway has been made in investigating the question of the extent to which the conscious or unconscious 
expectations and theories held by the analyst influence the clinical responses of the patient To say nothing 
about the conscious attempts to influence the patient by proposing interpretations to him etc Years ago I 
introduced the term  Oedipus effect to describe the influence of a theory or expectation or prediction upon 
the event which it predicts or describes it will be remembered that the causal chain leading to Oedipus 
parricide was started by the oracles prediction of this event This is a characteristic and recurrent theme of such 
myths but one which seems to have failed to attract the interest of the analysts perhaps not accidentally The 
problem of confirmatory dreams suggested by the analyst is discussed by Freud for example in Gesammelte 
Schriften III  where he says on p  If anybody asserts that most of the dreams which can be utilized 
in an analysis    owe their origin to the analysts suggestion then no objection can be made from the point of 
view of analytic theory Yet there is nothing in this fact he surprisingly adds which would detract from the 
reliability of our results 
 The case of astrology nowadays a typical pseudoscience may illustrate this point It was attacked by 
Aristotelians and other rationalists down to Newtons day for the wrong reasonfor its now accepted assertion 
that the planets had an influence upon terrestrial sublunar events In fact Newtons theory of gravity and 
especially the lunar theory of the tides was historically speaking an offspring of astrological lore Newton it 
seems was most reluctant to adopt a theory which came from the same stable as for example the theory that 
influenza epidemics are due to an astral influence And Galileo no doubt for the same reason actually rejected 
the lunar theory of the tides and his misgivings about Kepler may easily be explained by his misgivings about 
astrology 

 

scientific character some of them unfortunately as influential as the Marxist interpretation of history for example 
the racialist interpretation of historyanother of those impressive and allexplanatory theories which act upon weak 
minds like revelations 

Thus the problem which I tried to solve by proposing the criterion of falsifiability was neither a problem of 
meaningfulness or significance nor a problem of truth or acceptability It was the problem of drawing a line as well 
as this can be done between the statements or systems of statements of the empirical sciences and all other 
statementswhether they are of a religious or of a metaphysical character or simply pseudoscientific Years laterit 
must have been in  or I called this first problem of mine the problem of demarcation The criterion of 
falsifiability is a solution to this problem of demarcation for it says that statements or systems of statements in order 
to be ranked as scientific must be capable of conflicting with possible or conceivable observations 

III 

Today I know of course that this criterion of demarcationthe criterion of testability or falsifiability or 
refutabilityis far from obvious for even now its significance is seldom realized At that time in  it seemed to me 
almost trivial although it solved for me an intellectual problem which had worried me deeply and one which also had 
obvious practical consequences for example political ones But I did not yet realize its full implications or its 
philosophical significance When I explained it to a fellow student of the Mathematics Department now a 
distinguished mathematician in Great Britain he suggested that I should publish it At the time I thought this absurd 
for I was convinced that my problem since it was so important for me must have agitated many scientists and 
philosophers who would surely have reached my rather obvious solution That this was not the case I learnt from 
Wittgensteins work and from its reception and so I published my results thirteen years later in the form of a criticism 
of Wittgensteins criterion of meaningfulness 

Wittgenstein as you all know tried to show in the Tractatus see for example his propositions   and  
that all socalled philosophical or metaphysical propositions were actually nonpropositions or pseudopropositions 
that they were senseless or meaningless All genuine or meaningful propositions were truth functions of the 
elementary or atomic propositions which described atomic facts iefacts which can in principle be ascertained by 
observation In other words meaningful propositions were fully reducible to elementary or atomic propositions which 
were simple statements describing possible states of affairs and which could in principle be established or rejected 
by observation If we call a statement an observation statement not only if it states an actual observation but also if it 
states anything that may be observed we shall have to say according to the Tractatus  and  that every 
genuine proposition must be a truthfunction of and 

 

 

 

therefore deducible from observation statements All other apparent propositions will be meaningless pseudo
propositions in fact they will be nothing but nonsensical gibberish 

This idea was used by Wittgenstein for a characterization of science as opposed to philosophy We read for 
example in  where natural science is taken to stand in opposition to philosophy The totality of true propositions 
is the total natural science or the totality of the natural sciences This means that the propositions which belong to 
science are those deducible from true observation statements they are those propositions which can be verified by 
true observation statements Could we know all true observation statements we should also know all that may be 
asserted by natural science 

This amounts to a crude verifiability criterion of demarcation To make it slightly less crude it could be amended thus 
The statements which may possibly fall within the province of science are those which may possibly be verified by 
observation statements and these statements again coincide with the class of all genuine or meaningful 
statements For this approach then verifiability meaningfulness and scientific character all coincide 

I personally was never interested in the socalled problem of meaning on the contrary it appeared to me a verbal 
problem a typical pseudoproblem I was interested only in the problem of demarcation ie in finding a criterion of 
the scientific character of theories It was just this interest which made me see at once that Wittgensteins verifiability 
criterion of meaning was intended to play the part of a criterion of demarcation as well and which made me see that 
as such it was totally inadequate even if all misgivings about the dubious concept of meaning were set aside For 
Wittgensteins criterion of demarcationto use my own terminology in this contextis verifiability or deducibility from 
observation statements But this criterion is too narrow and too wide it excludes from science practically everything 
that is in fact characteristic of it while failing in effect to exclude astrology No scientific theory can ever be deduced 
from observation statements or be described as a truthfunction of observation statements 

All this I pointed out on various occasions to Wittgensteinians and members of the Vienna Circle In  I 
summarized my ideas in a largish book read by several members of the Circle but never published although part of 
it was incorporated in my Logic of Scientific Discovery and in  I published a letter to the Editor of 
Erkenntnis in which I tried to compress into two pages my ideas on the problems of demarcation and induction  In 
this letter 

 

 My Logic of Scientific Discovery     here usually referred to as LScD is the 
translation of Logik der Forschung   with a number of additional notes and appendices including on 
pp  the letter to the Editor of Erkenntnis mentioned here in the text it was first published in 
Erkenntnis   pp  f 

Concerning my never published book mentioned here in the text see R Carnap paper Ueber 
Protokollstze On ProtocolSentences Erkenntnis   pp  where he gives an outline of my 
theory on pp  and accepts it He calls my theory procedure B and says p  top Starting from a point 
of view different from Neuraths who developed what Carnap calls on p  procedure A Popper developed 
procedure B as part of his system And after describing in detail my theory of tests Carnap sums up his views as 
follows p   After weighing the various arguments here discussed it appears to me that the second 
language form with procedure Bthat is in the form here describedis the most adequate among the forms of 
scientific language at present advocated    in the    theory of knowledge This paper of Carnaps contained the 
first published report of my theory of critical testing See also my critical remarks in LScD note  to section 

 p  where the date   should read   and ch  below text to note  

 

 

and elsewhere I described the problem of meaning as a pseudoproblem in contrast to the problem of demarcation 
But my contribution was classified by members of the Circle as a proposal to replace the verifiability criterion of 
meaning by a falsifiability criterion of meaningwhich effectively made nonsense of my views  My protests that I 
was trying to solve not their pseudoproblem of meaning but the problem of demarcation were of no avail 

My attacks upon verification had some effect however They soon led to complete confusion in the camp of the 
verificationist philosophers of sense and nonsense The original proposal of verifiability as the criterion of meaning 
was at least clear simple and forceful The modifications and shifts which were now introduced were the very 
opposite  This I should say is now seen even by the participants But since I am usually quoted as one of them I 
wish to repeat that although I created this confusion I never participated in it Neither falsifiability nor testability were 
proposed by me as criteria of meaning and although I may plead guilty to having introduced both terms into the 
discussion it was not I who introduced them into the theory of meaning 

Criticism of my alleged views was widespread and highly successful I have yet to meet a criticism of my views  
Meanwhile testability is being widely accepted as a criterion of demarcation 

 

 Wittgensteins example of a nonsensical pseudoproposition is  Socrates is identical Obviously  Socrates is not 
identical must also be nonsense Thus the negation of any nonsense will be nonsense and that of a meaningful 
statement will be meaningful But the negation of a testable or falsifiable statement need not be 
testable as was pointed out first in my LScD eg pp  f and later by my critics The confusion caused 
by taking testability as a criterion of meaning rather than of demarcation can easily be imagined 
 The most recent example of the way in which the history of this problem is misunderstood is A R White Note on 
Meaning and Verification Mind   pp  ff J L Evans article Mind   pp  ff which Mr 
White criticizes is excellent in my opinion and unusually perceptive Understandably enough neither of the 
authors can quite reconstruct the story Some hints may be found in my Open Society notes   and  to 
ch  and a fuller analysis in ch  of the present volume 
 In LScD I discussed and replied to some likely objections which afterwards were indeed raised without 
reference to my replies One of them is the contention that the falsification of a natural law is just as impossible as 
its verification The answer is that this objection mixes two entirely different levels of analysis like the objection 
that mathematical demonstrations are impossible since checking no matter how often repeated can never make 
it quite certain that we have not overlooked a mistake On the first level there is a logical asymmetry one 
singular statementsay about the perihelion of Mercurycan formally falsify Keplers laws but these cannot be 
formally verified by any number of singular statements The attempt to minimize this asymmetry can only lead to 
confusion On another level we may hesitate to accept any statement even the simplest observation statement 
and we may point out that every statement involves interpretation in the light of theories and that it is 
therefore uncertain This does not affect the fundamental asymmetry but it is important most dissectors of the 
heart before Harvey observed the wrong thingsthose which they expected to see There can never be anything 
like a completely safe observation free from the dangers of misinterpretation This is one of the reasons why the 

theory of induction does not work The empirical basis consists largely of a mixture of theories of lower degree 
of universality of reproducible effects But the fact remains that relative to whatever basis the investigator may 
accept at his peril he can test his theory only by trying to refute it 

 

 

IV 

I have discussed the problem of demarcation in some detail because I believe that its solution is the key to most of 
the fundamental problems of the philosophy of science I am going to give you later a list of some of these other 
problems but only one of themthe problem of inductioncan be discussed here at any length 

I had become interested in the problem of induction in  Although this problem is very closely connected with the 
problem of demarcation I did not fully appreciate the connection for about five years 

I approached the problem of induction through Hume Hume I felt was perfectly right in pointing out that induction 
cannot be logically justified He held that there can be no valid logical  arguments allowing us to establish that 
those instances of which we have had no experience resemble those of which we have had 
experience Consequently even after the observation of the frequent or constant conjunction of 
objects we have no reason to draw any inference concerning any object beyond those of which 
we have had experience For shoud it be said that we have experience  experience teaching us that 
objects constantly conjoined with certain other objects continue to be so conjoinedthen Hume says I woud renew 
my question why from this experience we form any conclusion beyond those past instances of 
which we have had experience In other words an attempt to justify the practice of induction by an appeal to 
experience must lead to an infinite regress As a result we can say that theories can never be inferred from 
observation statements or rationally justified by them 

I found Humes refutation of inductive inference clear and conclusive But I felt completely dissatisfied with his 
psychological explanation of induction in terms of custom or habit 

It has often been noticed that this explanation of Humes is philosophically not very satisfactory It is however 
without doubt intended as a psychological rather than a philosophical theory for it tries to give a causal 
explanation of a psychological factthe fact that we believe in laws in statements asserting regularities or 
constantly conjoined kinds of eventsby asserting that this fact is due to ie constantly conjoined with custom or 
habit But even this reformulation of Humes theory is still unsatisfactory for what I have just called a psychological 
fact may itself be described as a custom or habit  

 
 This and the next quotation are from loc cit section vi See also Hume Enquiry Concerning Human 
Understanding section IV Part II and his Abstract edited  by J M Keynes and P Sraffa p  and

the custom or habit of believing in laws or regularities and it is neither very surprising nor very enlightening to hear 
that such a custom or habit must be explained as due to or conjoined with a custom or habit even though a different 
one Only when we remember that the words custom and habit are used by Hume as they are in ordinary 
language not merely to describe regular behaviour but rather to theorize about its origin ascribed to frequent 
repetition can we reformulate his psychological theory in a more satisfactory way We can then say that like other 
habits our habit of believing in laws is the product of frequent repetitionof the repeated observation 
that things of a certain kind are constantly conjoined with things of another kindThis geneticopsychological theory is 
as indicated incorporated in ordinary language and it is therefore hardly as revolutionary as Hume thought It is no 
doubt an extremely popular psychological theorypart of common sense one might say But in spite of my love of 
both common sense and Hume I felt convinced that this psychological theory was mistaken and that it was in fact 
refutable on purely logical grounds Humes psychology which is the popular psychology was mistaken I felt about 
at least three different things a the typical result of repetition b the genesis of habits and especially c the 
character of those experiences or modes of behaviour which may be described as believing in a law or expecting a 
lawlike succession of events 
A 

The typical result of repetitionsay of repeating a difficult passage on the pianois that movements which at 
first needed attention are in the end executed without attention We might say that the process becomes 
radically abbreviated and ceases to be conscious it becomes physiological Such a process far from creating 
a conscious expectation of lawlike succession or a belief in a law may on the contrary begin with a conscious 
belief and destroy it by making it superfluous In learning to ride a bicycle we may start with the belief that we 
can avoid falling if we steer in the direction in which we threaten to fall and this belief may be useful for guiding 
our movements After sufficient practice we may forget the rule in any case we do not need it any longer On 
the other hand even if it is true that repetition may create unconscious expectations these become conscious 
only if something goes wrong we may not have heard the clock tick but we may hear that it has stopped 
B  Habits or customs do not as a rule originate in repetition Even the habit of walking or of speaking or of 

feeding at certain hours begins before repetition can play any part whatever We may say if we like that they 
deserve to be called habits or customs only after repetition has played its typical part but we must not say 
that the practices in question originated as the result of many repetitions 
Belief in a law is not quite the same thing as behaviour which betrays an expectation of a lawlike succession of 
events but these two are sufficiently closely connected to be treated together They may perhaps in 
exceptional cases result from a mere repetition of sense impressions as in the case of the 

C 

 

 

 

stopping clock I was prepared to concede this but I contended that normally and in most cases of any 
interest they cannot be so explained As Hume admits even a single striking observation may be sufficient to 
create a belief or an expectationa fact which he tries to explain as due to an inductive habit formed as the 
result of a vast number of long repetitive sequences which had been experienced at an earlier period of life  
But this I contended was merely his attempt to explain away unfavourable facts which threatened his theory 
an unsuccessful attempt since these unfavourable facts could be observed in very young animals and babies
as early indeed as we like A lighted cigarette was held near the noses of the young puppies reports F Bge 
They sniffed at it once turned tail and nothing would induce them to come back to the source of the smell and 
to sniff again A few days later they reacted to the mere sight of a cigarette or even of a rolled piece of white 
paper by bounding away and sneezing  If we try to explain cases like this by postulating a vast number of 
long repetitive sequences at a still earlier age we are not only romancing but forgetting that in the clever 
puppies short lives there must be room not only for repetition but also for a great deal of novelty and 
consequently of nonrepetition 

But it is not only that certain empirical facts do not support Hume there are decisive arguments of a purely logical 
nature against his psychological theory 

The central idea of Humes theory is that of repetition based upon similarity or resemblance This idea is 
used in a very uncritical way We are led to think of the waterdrop that hollows the stone of sequences of 
unquestionably like events slowly forcing themselves upon us as does the tick of the clock But we ought to realize 
that in a psychological theory such as Humes only repetitionforus based upon similarityforus can be allowed to 
have any effect upon us We must respond to situations as if they were equivalent take them as similar interpret 
them as repetitions The clever puppies we may assume showed by their response their way of acting or of 
reacting that they recognized or interpreted the second situation as a repetition of the first that they expected its 
main element the objectionable smell to be present The situation was a repetitionforthem because they responded 
to it by anticipating its similarity to the previous one 

This apparently psychological criticism has a purely logical basis which may be summed up in the following simple 
argument It happens to be the one from which I originally started my criticism The kind of repetition envisaged by 
Hume can never be perfect the cases he has in mind cannot be cases of perfect sameness they can only be cases 
of similarity Thus they are repetitions only from a certain point of view What has the effect upon me of a 
repetition may not have this effect upon a spider But this means that for logical reasons there must always be a 
point of viewsuch as a system of 

 
 Treatise section xiii section XV rule  
 F Bge Zur Entwicklung etc Zeitschrift f Hundeforschung  cp D Katz Animals and 
Men ch VI footnote 

 

 

expectations anticipations assumptions or interestsbefore there can be any repetition which point of view 
consequently cannot be merely the result of repetition See now also appendix X  to my LScD 

We must thus replace for the purposes of a psychological theory of the origin of our beliefs the nave idea of events 
which are similar by the idea of events to which we react by interpreting them as being similar But if this is so 
and I can see no escape from it then Humes psychological theory of induction leads to an infinite regress precisely 
analogous to that other infinite regress which was discovered by Hume himself and used by him to explode the 
logical theory of induction For what do we wish to explain In the example of the puppies we wish to explain 
behaviour which may be described as recognizing or interpreting a situation as a repetition of another Clearly 
we cannot hope to explain this by an appeal to earlier repetitions once we realize that the earlier repetitions must 
also have been repetitionsforthem so that precisely the same problem arises again that of recognizing or 
interpreting a situation as a repetition of another 

To put it more concisely similarityforus is the product of a response involving interpretations which may be 
inadequate and anticipations or expectations which may never be fulfilled It is therefore impossible to explain 
anticipations or expectations as resulting from many repetitions as suggested by Hume For even the first repetition
forus must be based upon similarityforus and therefore upon expectationsprecisely the kind of thing we wished to 
explain 

This shows that there is an infinite regress involved in Humes psychological theory 

Hume I felt had never accepted the full force of his own logical analysis Having refuted the logical idea of induction 
he was faced with the following problem how do we actually obtain our knowledge as a matter of psychological fact 
if induction is a procedure which is logically invalid and rationally unjustifiable There are two possible answers  
We obtain our knowledge by a noninductive procedure This answer would have allowed Hume to retain a form of 
rationalism  We obtain our knowledge by repetition and induction and therefore by a logically invalid and rationally 
unjustifiable procedure so that all apparent knowledge is merely a kind of beliefbelief based on habit This answer 
would imply that even scientific knowledge is irrational so that rationalism is absurd and must be given up I shall 
not discuss here the ageold attempts now again fashionable to get out of the difficulty by asserting that though 
induction is of course logically invalid if we mean by logic the same as deductive logic it is not irrational by its own 
standards as may be seen from the fact that every reasonable man applies it as a matter of fact it was Humes 
great achievement to break this uncritical identification of the question of factquid factiand the question of 
justification or validityquid juris See below point  of the appendix to the present chapter 

It seems that Hume never seriously considered the first alternative Having 

 

 

cast out the logical theory of induction by repetition he struck a bargain with common sense meekly allowing the re
entry of induction by repetition in the guise of a psychological theory I proposed to turn the tables upon this theory of 
Humes Instead of explaining our propensity to expect regularities as the result of repetition I proposed to explain 
repetitionforus as the result of our propensity to expect regularities and to search for them 

Thus I was led by purely logical considerations to replace the psychological theory of induction by the following view 
Without waiting passively for repetitions to impress or impose regularities upon us we actively try to impose 
regularities upon the world We try to discover similarities in it and to interpret it in terms of laws invented by us 
Without waiting for premises we jump to conclusions These may have to be discarded later should observation 
show that they are wrong 

This was a theory of trial and errorof conjectures and refutations It made it possible to understand why our 
attempts to force interpretations upon the world were logically prior to the observation of similarities Since there were 
logical reasons behind this procedure I thought that it would apply in the field of science also that scientific theories 
were not the digest of observations but that they were inventionsconjectures boldly put forward for trial to be 
eliminated if they clashed with observations with observations which were rarely accidental but as a rule undertaken 
with the definite intention of testing a theory by obtaining if possible a decisive refutation 

V 

The belief that science proceeds from observation to theory is still so widely and so firmly held that my denial of it is 
often met with incredulity I have even been suspected of being insincereof denying what nobody in his senses can 
doubt 

But in fact the belief that we can start with pure observations alone without anything in the nature of a theory is 
absurd as may be illustrated by the story of the man who dedicated his life to natural science wrote down everything 
he could observe and bequeathed his priceless collection of observations to the Royal Society to be used as 
inductive evidence This story should show us that though beetles may profitably be collected observations may not 

Twentyfive years ago I tried to bring home the same point to a group of physics students in Vienna by beginning a 
lecture with the following instructions Take pencil and paper carefully observe and write down what you have 
observed They asked of course what I wanted them to observe Clearly the instruction Observe is absurd  It 
is not even idiomatic unless the object of the transitive verb can be taken as understood Observation is always 
selective It needs a chosen object a definite task an interest a point of view a problem And its description 
presupposes a descriptive language with property words it presupposes similarity and classification which in its turn 
presupposes interests points of view and problems A hungry animal 

 
 See section  of LScD 

 

 

writes Katz  divides the environment into edible and inedible things An animal in flight sees roads to escape and 
hiding places    Generally speaking objects change    according to the needs of the animal We may add that 
objects can be classified and can become similar or dissimilar only in this wayby being related to needs and 
interests This rule applies not only to animals but also to scientists For the animal a point of view is provided by its 
needs the task of the moment and its expectations for the scientist by his theoretical interests the special problem 
under investigation his conjectures and anticipations and the theories which he accepts as a kind of background his 
frame of reference his horizon of expectations 

The problem Which comes first the hypothesis H or the observation O is soluble as is the problem Which 
comes first the hen H or the egg O The reply to the latter is An earlier kind of egg to the former An earlier 
kind of hypothesis It is quite true that any particular hypothesis we choose will have been preceded by observations
the observations for example which it is designed to explain But these observations in their turn presupposed the 
adoption of a frame of reference a frame of expectations a frame of theories If they were significant if they created 
a need for explanation and thus gave rise to the invention of a hypothesis it was because they could not be 
explained within the old theoretical framework the old horizon of expectations There is no danger here of an infinite 
regress Going back to more and more primitive theories and myths we shall in the end find unconscious inborn 
expectations 

The theory of inborn ideas is absurd I think but every organism has inborn reactions or responses and among 
them responses adapted to impending events These responses we may describe as expectations without implying 
that these expectations are conscious The newborn baby expects in this sense to be fed and one could even 
argue to be protected and loved In view of the close relation between expectation and knowledge we may even 
speak in quite a reasonable sense of inborn knowledge This knowledge is not however valid a priori an inborn 
expectation no matter how strong and specific may be mistaken The newborn child may be abandoned and 
starve 

Thus we are born with expectations with knowledge which although not valid a priori is psychologically or 
genetically a priori ie prior to all observational experience One of the most important of these expectations is 
the expectation of finding a regularity It is connected with an inborn propensity to look out for regularities or with a 
need to find regularities as we may see from the pleasure of the child who satisfies this need 

This instinctive expectation of finding regularities which is psychologically a priori corresponds very closely to the 
law of causality which Kant believed to be part of our mental outfit and to be a priori valid One might thus be 
inclined to say that Kant failed to distinguish between psychologically a priori ways of thinking or responding and a 
priori valid beliefs But I do 

 
 Katz loc cit 

 

 

not think that his mistake was quite as crude as that For the expectation of finding regularities is not only 
psychologically a priori but also logically a priori it is logically prior to all observational experience for it is prior to 
any recognition of similarities as we have seen and all observation involves the recognition of similarities or 
dissimilarities But in spite of being logically a priori in this sense the expectation is not valid a priori For it may 
fail we can easily construct an environment it would be a lethal one which compared with our ordinary 
environment is so chaotic that we completely fail to find regularities All natural laws could remain valid 
environments of this kind have been used in the animal experiments mentioned in the next section 

Thus Kants reply to Hume came near to being right for the distinction between an a priori valid expectation and 
one which is both genetically and logically prior to observation but not a priori valid is really somewhat subtle But 
Kant proved too much In trying to show how knowledge is possible he proposed a theory which had the unavoidable 
consequence that our quest for knowledge must necessarily succeed which is clearly mistaken When Kant said 
Our intellect does not draw its laws from nature but imposes its laws upon nature he was right But in thinking that 
these laws are necessarily true or that we necessarily succeed in imposing them upon nature he was wrong  
Nature very often resists quite successfully forcing us to discard our laws as refuted but if we live we may try again 

To sum up this logical criticism of Humes psychology of induction we may consider the idea of building an induction 
machine Placed in a simplified world for example one of sequences of coloured counters such a machine may 
through repetition learn or even formulate laws of succession which hold in its world If such a machine can be 
constructed and I have no doubt that it can then it might be argued my theory must be wrong for if a machine is 
capable of performing inductions on the basis of repetition there can be no logical reasons preventing us from doing 
the same 

The argument sounds convincing but it is mistaken In constructing an induction machine we the architects of the 
machine must decide a priori what constitutes its world what things are to be taken as similar or equal and what 
kind of laws we wish the machine to be able to discover in its world In other words we must build into the 
machine a framework determining what is relevant or interesting in its world the machine will have its inborn 
selection principles The problems of similarity will have been solved for it by its makers who thus have interpreted 
the world for the machine 

 
 Kant believed that Newtons dynamics was a priori valid See his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural 
Science published between the first and the second editions of the Critique of Pure Reason But if as he 
thought we can explain the validity of Newtons theory by the fact that our intellect imposes its laws upon nature 
it follows I think that our intellect must succeed in this which makes it hard to understand why a priori 
knowledge such as Newtons should be so hard to come by A somewhat fuller statement of this criticism can be 
found in ch  especially section ix and chs  and  of the present volume 

 

 

VI 

Our propensity to look out for regularities and to impose laws upon nature leads to the psychological phenomenon 
of dogmatic thinking or more generally dogmatic behaviour we expect regularities everywhere and attempt to 
find them even where there are none events which do not yield to these attempts we are inclined to treat as a kind of 
background noise and we stick to our expectations even when they are inadequate and we ought to accept defeat 
This dogmatism is to some extent necessary It is demanded by a situation which can only be dealt with by forcing 
our conjectures upon the world Moreover this dogmatism allows us to approach a good theory in stages by way of 
approximations if we accept defeat too easily we may prevent ourselves from finding that we were very nearly right 

It is clear that this dogmatic attitude which makes us stick to our first impressions is indicative of a strong belief 
while a critical attitude which is ready to modify its tenets which admits doubt and demands tests is indicative of 
a weaker belief Now according to Humes theory and to the popular theory the strength of a belief should be a 
product of repetition thus it should always grow with experience and always be greater in less primitive persons But 
dogmatic thinking an uncontrolled wish to impose regularities a manifest pleasure in rites and in repetition as such 
are characteristic of primitives and children and increasing experience and maturity sometimes create an attitude of 
caution and criticism rather than of dogmatism 

I may perhaps mention here a point of agreement with psychoanalysis Psychoanalysts assert that neurotics and 
others interpret the world in accordance with a personal set pattern which is not easily given up and which can often 
be traced back to early childhood A pattern or scheme which was adopted very early in life is maintained throughout 
and every new experience is interpreted in terms of it verifying it as it were and contributing to its rigidity This is a 
description of what I have called the dogmatic attitude as distinct from the critical attitude which shares with the 
dogmatic attitude the quick adoption of a schema of expectationsa myth perhaps or a conjecture or hypothesis
but which is ready to modify it to correct it and even to give it up I am inclined to suggest that most neuroses may 
be due to a partially arrested development of the critical attitude to an arrested rather than a natural dogmatism to 
resistance to demands for the modification and adjustment of certain schematic interpretations and responses This 
resistance in its turn may perhaps be explained in some cases as due to an injury or shock resulting in fear and in 
an increased need for assurance or certainty analogous to the way in which an injury to a limb makes us afraid to 
move it so that it becomes stiff It might even be argued that the case of the limb is not merely analogous to the 
dogmatic response but an instance of it The explanation of any concrete case will have to take into account the 
weight of the difficulties involved in making the necessary adjustmentsdifficulties which may be considerable 
especially in a complex 

 

 

and changing world we know from experiments on animals that varying degrees of neurotic behaviour may be 
produced at will by correspondingly varying difficulties 

I found many other links between the psychology of knowledge and psychological fields which are often considered 
remote from itfor example the psychology of art and music in fact my ideas about induction originated in a 
conjecture about the evolution of Western polyphony But you will be spared this story 

VII 

My logical criticism of Humes psychological theory and the considerations connected with it most of which I 
elaborated in  in a thesis entitled On Habit and Belief in Laws   may seem a little removed from the field 
of the philosophy of science But the distinction between dogmatic and critical thinking or the dogmatic and the 
critical attitude brings us right back to our central problem For the dogmatic attitude is clearly related to the tendency 
to verify our laws and schemata by seeking to apply them and to confirm them even to the point of neglecting 
refutations whereas the critical attitude is one of readiness to change themto test them to refute them to falsify 
them if possible This suggests that we may identify the critical attitude with the scientific attitude and the dogmatic 
attitude with the one which we have described as pseudoscientific 

It further suggests that genetically speaking the pseudoscientific attitude is more primitive than and prior to the 
scientific attitude that it is a prescientific attitude And this primitivity or priority also has its logical aspect For the 
critical attitude is not so much opposed to the dogmatic attitude as superimposed upon it criticism must be directed 
against existing and influential beliefs in need of critical revisionin other words dogmatic beliefs A critical attitude 
needs for its raw material as it were theories or beliefs which are held more or less dogmatically 

Thus science must begin with myths and with the criticism of myths neither with the collection of observations nor 
with the invention of experiments but with the critical discussion of myths and of magical techniques and practices 
The scientific tradition is distinguished from the prescientific tradition in having two layers Like the latter it passes on 
its theories but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them The theories are passed on not as dogmas but 
rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them This tradition is Hellenic it may be traced back to 
Thales founder of the first school I do not mean of the first philosophical school but simply of the first school 
which was not mainly concerned with the preservation of a dogma  

The critical attitude the tradition of free discussion of theories with the

aim of discovering their weak spots so that they may be improved upon is the attitude of reasonableness of 
rationality It makes farreaching use of both verbal argument and observationof observation in the interest of 
argument however The Greeks discovery of the critical method gave rise at first to the mistaken hope that it would 
lead to the solution of all the great old problems that it would establish certainty that it would help to prove our 
theories to justify them But this hope was a residue of the dogmatic way of thinking in fact nothing can be justified 
or proved outside of mathematics and logic The demand for rational proofs in science indicates a failure to keep 
distinct the broad realm of rationality and the narrow realm of rational certainty it is an untenable an unreasonable 
demand 

Nevertheless the role of logical argument of deductive logical reasoning remains allimportant for the critical 
approach not because it allows us to prove our theories or to infer them from observation statements but because 
only by purely deductive reasoning is it possible for us to discover what our theories imply and thus to criticize them 
effectively Criticism I said is an attempt to find the weak spots in a theory and these as a rule can be found only in 
the more remote logical consequences which can be derived from it It is here that purely logical reasoning plays an 
important part in science 

Hume was right in stressing that our theories cannot be validly inferred from what we can know to be trueneither 
from observations nor from anything else He concluded from this that our belief in them was irrational If belief 
means here our inability to doubt our natural laws and the constancy of natural regularities then Hume is again right 
this kind of dogmatic belief has one might say a physiological rather than a rational basis If however the term 
belief is taken to cover our critical acceptance of scientific theories a tentative acceptance combined with an 
eagerness to revise the theory if we succeed in designing a test which it cannot passthen Hume was wrong In such 
an acceptance of theories there is nothing irrational There is not even anything irrational in relying for practical 
purposes upon welltested theories for no more rational course of action is open to us 

Assume that we have deliberately made it our task to live in this unknown world of ours to adjust ourselves to it as 
well as we can to take advantage of the opportunities we can find in it and to explain it if possible we need not 
assume that it is and as far as possible with the help of laws and explanatory theories If we have made this 
our task then there is no more rational procedure than the method of trial and errorof 
conjecture and refutation of boldly proposing theories of trying our best to show that these are erroneous and 
of accepting them tentatively if our critical efforts are unsuccessful 

From the point of view here developed all laws all theories remain essentially tentative or conjectural or 
hypothetical even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer Before a theory has been refuted we can never 
know in what way it may have to be modified That the sun will always rise and set within twentyfour hours is still 
proverbial as a law established by induction beyond reasonable doubt It is odd that this example is still in use 
though it 

 

 

may have served well enough in the days of Aristotle and Pytheas of Massalia the great traveller who for centuries 
was called a liar because of his tales of Thule the land of the frozen sea and the midnight sun 

The method of trial and error is not of course simply identical with the scientific or critical approachwith the method 
of conjecture and refutation The method of trial and error is applied not only by Einstein but in a more dogmatic 
fashion by the amoeba also The difference lies not so much in the trials as in a critical and constructive attitude 
towards errors errors which the scientist consciously and cautiously tries to uncover in order to refute his theories 
with searching arguments including appeals to the most severe experimental tests which his theories and his 
ingenuity permit him to design 

The critical attitude may be described as the conscious attempt to make our theories our conjectures suffer in our 
stead in the struggle for the survival of the fittest It gives us a chance to survive the elimination of an inadequate 
hypothesiswhen a more dogmatic attitude would eliminate it by eliminating us There is a touching story of an 
Indian community which disappeared because of its belief in the holiness of life including that of tigers We thus 
obtain the fittest theory within our reach by the elimination of those which are less fit By fitness I do not mean 
merely usefulness but truth see chapters  and  below I do not think that this procedure is irrational or in need 
of any further rational justification

Let us now turn from our logical criticism of the psychology of experience to our real problemthe problem of 
the logic of science Although some of the things I have said may help us here in so far as they may have 
eliminated certain psychological prejudices in favour of induction my treatment of the logical problem of 
induction is completely independent of this criticism and of all psychological considerations Provided you do not 
dogmatically believe in the alleged psychological fact that we make inductions you may now forget my whole story 
with the exception of two logical points my logical remarks on testability or falsifiability as the criterion of 
demarcation and Humes logical criticism of induction 

From what I have said it is obvious that there was a close link between the two problems which interested me at that 
time demarcation and induction or scientific method It was easy to see that the method of science is criticism ie 
attempted falsifications Yet it took me a few years to notice that the two problemsof demarcation and of induction
were in a sense one 

Why I asked do so many scientists believe in induction I found they did so because they believed natural science 
to be characterized by the inductive methodby a method starting from and relying upon long sequences of 
observations and experiments They believed that the difference between genuine science and metaphysical or 
pseudoscientific speculation depended solely upon whether or not the inductive method was employed They 

 

 

believed to put it in my own terminology that only the inductive method could provide a satisfactory criterion of 
demarcationI recently came across an interesting formulation of this belief in a remarkable philosophical book by a 
great physicist Max Born Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance  He writes Induction allows us to 
generalize a number of observations into a general rule that night follows day and day follows night    But while 
everyday life has no definite criterion for the validity of an induction    science has worked out a code or rule of 
craft for its application Born nowhere reveals the contents of this inductive code which as his wording shows 
contains a definite criterion for the validity of an induction but he stresses that there is no logical argument for its 
acceptance it is a question of faith and he is therefore willing to call induction a metaphysical principle But why 
does he believe that such a code of valid inductive rules must exist This becomes clear when he speaks of the vast 
communities of people ignorant of or rejecting the rule of science among them the members of antivaccination 
societies and believers in astrology It is useless to argue with them I cannot compel them to accept the same criteria 
of valid induction in which I believe the code of scientific rules This makes it quite clear that valid induction as 
here meant to serve as a criterion of demarcation between science and pseudoscienceBut it is 
obvious that this rule or craft of valid induction is not even metaphysical it simply does not exist No rule can ever 
guarantee that a generalization inferred from true observations however often repeated is true  Born himself does 
not believe in the truth of Newtonian physics in spite of its success although he believes that it is based on 
induction And the success of science is not based upon rules of induction but depends upon luck ingenuity and 
the purely deductive rules of critical argumentI may summarize some of my conclusions as follows 
 

Induction ie inference based on many observations is a myth It is neither a psychological fact nor a fact of 
ordinary life nor one of scientific procedure 
The actual procedure of science is to operate with conjectures to jump to conclusionsoften after one single 
observation as noticed for example by Hume and Born 
Repeated observations and experiments function in science as tests of our conjectures or hypotheses ie as 
attempted refutations 
The mistaken belief in induction is fortified by the need for a criterion of demarcation which it is traditionally but 
wrongly believed only the inductive method can provide 
The conception of such an inductive method like the criterion of verifiability implies a faulty demarcation 
None of this is altered in the least if we say that induction makes theories only probable rather than certain 
See especially chapter  below

If as I have suggested the problem of induction is only an instance or facet of the problem of demarcation then the 
solution to the problem of demarcation must provide us with a solution to the problem of induction This is indeed the 
case I believe although it is perhaps not immediately obvious 

For a brief formulation of the problem of induction we can turn again to Born who writes    no observation or 
experiment however extended can give more than a finite number of repetitions therefore the statement of a law
B depends on Aalways transcends experience Yet this kind of statement is made everywhere and all the time and 
sometimes from scanty material  

In other words the logical problem of induction arises from a Humes discovery so well expressed by Born that it 
is impossible to justify a law by observation or experiment since it transcends experience b the fact that science 
proposes and uses laws everywhere and all the time Like Hume Born is struck by the scanty material ie the few 
observed instances upon which the law may be based To this we have to add c theprinciple of empiricism 
which asserts that in science only observation and experiment may decide upon the acceptance or rejection of 
scientific statements including laws and theories 

These three principles a b and c appear at first sight to clash and this apparent clash constitutes the logical 
problem of induction 

Faced with this clash Born gives up c the principle of empiricism as Kant and many others including Bertrand 
Russell have done before him in favour of what he calls a metaphysical principle a metaphysical principle which 
he does not even attempt to formulate which he vaguely describes as a code or rule of craft and of which I have 
never seen any formulation which even looked promising and was not clearly untenable 

But in fact the principles a to c do not clash We can see this the moment we realize that the acceptance by 
science of a law or of a theory is tentative only which is to say that all laws and theories are conjectures or 
tentative hypotheses a position which I have sometimes called hypotheticism and that we may reject a law or 
theory on the basis of new evidence without necessarily discarding the old evidence which originally led us to accept 
it  

The principle of empiricism c can be fully preserved since the fate of a theory its acceptance or rejection is 
decided by observation and experiment by the result of tests So long as a theory stands up to the severest tests we 
can design it is accepted if it does not it is rejected But it is never inferred in any sense from the empirical 
evidence There is neither a psychological nor 

 
 Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance p  
 I do not doubt that Born and many others would agree that theories are accepted only tentatively But the 
widespread belief in induction shows that the farreaching implications of this view are rarely seen 

 

 

a logical induction Only the falsity of the theory can be inferred from empirical evidence and this 
inference is a purely deductive one 

Hume showed that it is not possible to infer a theory from observation statements but this does not affect the 
possibility of refuting a theory by observation statements The full appreciation of this possibility makes the relation 
between theories and observations perfectly clear 

This solves the problem of the alleged clash between the principles a b and c and with it Humes problem of 
induction 

X 

Thus the problem of induction is solved But nothing seems less wanted than a simple solution to an ageold 
philosophical problem Wittgenstein and his school hold that genuine philosophical problems do not exist  from 
which it clearly follows that they cannot be solved Others among my contemporaries do believe that there are 
philosophical problems and respect them but they seem to respect them too much they seem to believe that they 
are insoluble if not taboo and they are shocked and horrified by the claim that there is a simple neat and lucid 
solution to any of them If there is a solution it must be deep they feel or at least complicated 

However this may be I am still waiting for a simple neat and lucid criticism of the solution which I published first in 
 in my letter to the Editor of Erkenntnis  and later in The Logic of Scientific Discovery 

Of course one can invent new problems of induction different from the one I have formulated and solved Its 
formulation was half its solution But I have yet to see any reformulation of the problem whose solution cannot be 
easily obtained from my old solution I am now going to discuss some of these reformulations 

One question which may be asked is this how do we really jump from an observation statement to a theory 

Although this question appears to be psychological rather than philosophical one can say something positive about it 
without invoking psychology One can say first that the jump is not from an observation statement but from a problem
situation and that the theory must allow us to explain the observations which created the problem that is to 
deduce them from the theory strengthened by other accepted theories and by other observation statements the so
called initial conditions This leaves of course an immense number of possible theories good and bad and it thus 
appears that our question has not been answered 

But this makes it fairly clear that when we asked our question we had more in mind than How do we jump from an 
observation statement to a theory The question we had in mind was it now appears How do we jump from an 
observation statement to a good theory But to this the answer is by jumping first to any theory and then testing it 
to find whether it is good or not ie 

 
 Wittgenstein still held this belief in  see note  to ch  below 
 See Note  above 

 

by repeatedly applying the critical method eliminating many bad theories and inventing many new ones Not 
everybody is able to do this but there is no other way 

Other questions have sometimes been asked The original problem of induction it was said is the problem of 
justifying induction ie of justifying inductive inference If you answer this problem by saying that what is called an 
inductive inference is always invalid and therefore clearly not justifiable the following new problem must arise how 
do you justify your method of trial and error Reply the method of trial and error is a method of eliminating false 
theories by observation statements and the justification for this is the purely logical relationship of deducibility 
which allows us to assert the falsity of universal statements if we accept the truth of singular ones 

Another question sometimes asked is this why is it reasonable to prefer nonfalsified statements to falsified ones To 
this question some involved answers have been produced for example pragmatic answers But from a pragmatic 
point of view the question does not arise since false theories often serve well enough most formulae used in 
engineering or navigation are known to be false although they may be excellent approximations and easy to handle 
and they are used with confidence by people who know them to be false 

The only correct answer is the straightforward one because we search for truth even though we can never be sure 
we have found it and because the falsified theories are known or believed to be false while the nonfalsified 
theories may still be true Besides we do not prefer every nonfalsified theory only one which in the light of 
criticism appears to be better than its competitors which solves our problems which is well tested and of which we 
think or rather conjecture or hope considering other provisionally accepted theories that it will stand up to further 
tests 

It has also been said that the problem of induction is Why is it reasonable to believe that the future will be like the 
past and that a satisfactory answer to this question should make it plain that such a belief is in fact reasonable 
My reply is that it is reasonable to believe that the future will be very different from the past in many vitally important 
respects Admittedly it is perfectly reasonable to act on the assumption that it will in many respects be like the past 
and that welltested laws will continue to hold since we can have no better assumption to act upon but it is also 
reasonable to believe that such a course of action will lead us at times into severe trouble since some of the laws 
upon which we now heavily rely may easily prove unreliable Remember the midnight sun One might even say that 
to judge from past experience and from our general scientific knowledge the future will not be like the past in 
perhaps most of the ways which those have in mind who say that it will Water will sometimes not quench thirst and 
air will choke those who breathe it An apparent way out is to say that the future will be like the past in the sense 
that the laws of nature will not change but this is begging the question We speak of a law of nature only if 
we think that we have before us a regularity which does not change and if we find that it changes then we shall not 

 

 

 

continue to call it a law of nature Of course our search for natural laws indicates that we hope to find them and that 
we believe that there are natural laws but our belief in any particular natural law cannot have a safer basis than our 
unsuccessful critical attempts to refute it 

I think that those who put the problem of induction in terms of the reasonableness of our beliefs are perfectly right 
if they are dissatisfied with a Humean or postHumean sceptical despair of reason We must indeed reject the view 
that a belief in science is as irrational as a belief in primitive magical practices that both are a matter of accepting a 
total ideology a convention or a tradition based on faith But we must be cautious if we formulate our problem with 
Hume as one of the reasonableness of our beliefs We should split this problem into threeour old problem of 
demarcation or of how to distinguish between science and primitive magic the problem of the rationality of the 
scientific or critical procedure and of the role of observation within it and lastly the problem of the rationality of our 
acceptance of theories for scientific and for practical purposes To all these three problems solutions have been 
offered here 

One should also be careful not to confuse the problem of the reasonableness of the scientific procedure and the 
tentative acceptance of the results of this procedureie the scientific theorieswith the problem of the rationality or 
otherwise of the belief that this procedure will succeed In practice in practical scientific research this belief 
is no doubt unavoidable and reasonable there being no better alternative But the belief is certainly unjustifiable in a 
theoretical sense as I have argued in section v Moreover if we could show on general logical grounds that the 
scientific quest is likely to succeed one could not understand why anything like success has been so rare in the long 
history of human endeavours to know more about our world 

Yet another way of putting the problem of induction is in terms of probability Let t be the theory and e the evidence 
we can ask for Pte that is to say the probability of t given e The problem of induction it is often believed can 
then be put thus construct a calculus of probability which allows us to work out for any theory t what its 
probability is relative to any given empirical evidence e and show that Pte increases with the accumulation of 
supporting evidence and reaches high valuesat any rate values greater than  

In The Logic of Scientific Discovery I explained why I think that this approach to the problem is fundamentally 
mistaken  To make this clear I introduced there the distinction between probability and degree of 
corroboration or confirmation The term confirmation has lately been so much used and misused that I have 
decided to surrender it to the verificationists and to use for my own purposes corroboration only The term 
probability is best 

 
 LScD see note  above ch x especially sections  to  also section  ff See also my note A Set of 
Independent Axioms for Probability Mind NS   p  This note has since been reprinted with 
corrections in the new appendix ii of LScD See also the next note but one to the present chapter 

 

 

used in some of the many senses which satisfy the wellknown calculus of probability axiomatized for example by 
Keynes Jeffreys and myself but nothing of course depends on the choice of words as long as we do not assume 
uncritically that degree of corroboration must also be a probability that is to say that it must satisfy the calculus of 
probability 

I explained in my book why we are interested in theories with a high degree of corroboration And I explained 
why it is a mistake to conclude from this that we are interested in highly probable theories I pointed out that the 
probability of a statement or set of statements is always the greater the less the statement says it is inverse to the 
content or the deductive power of the statement and thus to its explanatory power Accordingly every interesting and 
powerful statement must have a low probability and vice versa a statement with a high probability will be 
scientifically uninteresting because it says little and has no explanatory power Although we seek theories with a high 
degree of corroboration as scientists we do not seek highly probable theories but explanations that 
is to say powerful and improbable theories  The opposite viewthat science aims at high probabilityis a 
characteristic development of verificationism if you find that you cannot verify a theory or make it certain by 
induction you may turn to probability as a kind of Ersatz for certainty in the hope that induction may yield at least 
that much 

I have discussed the two problems of demarcation and induction at some length Yet since I set out to give you in this 
lecture a kind of report on the work I have done in this field I shall have to add in the form of an Appendix a few 
words about some other problems on which I have been working between  and  I Was led to most of these 
problems by trying to think out the consequences of the solutions to the two problems of demarcation and induction 
But time does not allow me to continue my narrative and to tell you how my new problems arose out of my old ones 
Since I cannot even start a discussion of these further problems now I shall have to confine my

te  Ctt upon empirical evidence e Ctt is the degree of corroborability of t and is equal to the 
degree of testability of t or to the content of t Because of the demands implied in point  at the end of

corroboration or as I previously used to say of confirmaion

self to giving you a bare list of them with a few explanatory words here and there But even a bare list may be useful 
I think It may serve to give an idea of the fertility of the approach It may help to illustrate what our problems look like 
and it may show how many there are and so convince you that there is no need whatever to worry over the question 
whether philosophical problems exist or what philosophy is really about So this list contains by implication an 
apology for my unwillingness to break with the old tradition of trying to solve problems with the help of rational 
argument and thus for my unwillingness to participate wholeheartedly in the developments trends and drifts of 
contemporary philosophy 
APPENDIX SOME PROBLEMS IN THE PHILOSOPHY OF 
SCIENCE 
My first three items in this list of additional problems are connected with the calculus of probabilities 
 

The frequency theory of probability In The Logic of Scientific Discovery I was interested in developing a 
consistent theory of probability as it is used in science which means a statistical or frequency theory of 
probability But I also operated there with another concept which I called logical probability I therefore felt the 
need for a generalizationfor a formal theory of probability which allows different interpretations a as a 
theory of the logical probability of a statement relative to any given evidence including a theory of absolute 
logical probability ie of the measure of the probability of a statement relative to zero evidence b as a theory 
of the probability of an event relative to any given ensemble or collective of events In solving this problem I 
obtained a simple theory which allows a number of further interpretations it may be interpreted as a calculus of 
contents or of deductive systems or as a class calculus Boolean algebra or as propositional calculus and 
also as a calculus of propensities  

 
 See my note in Mind loc cit The axiom system given there for elementary ie noncontinuous probability can 
be simplified as follows x   denotes the complement of x xy the intersection or conjunction of x and y

Axiom C holds in this form for the finitist theory only it may be omitted if we are prepared to put up with a 
condition such as Py  O in most of the theorems on relative probability For relative probability A  B and 
C  C is sufficient B is not needed For absolute probability A  B is necessary and sufficient 
without B we cannot for example derive the definition of absolute in terms of relative probability Px  Pxy  
 nor its weakened corollary xEy Py O and Px  Pxy from which B results immediately by substituting 
for Pxy its definiens Thus B like all other axioms with the possible exception of C expresses part of 
the intended meaning of the concepts involved and we must not look upon   Px or   Pxy which are 
derivable from B with B or with C and C as inessential conventions as Carnap and others have 
suggested 

Added  to the first proofs of this paper see also note  below 

I have since developed an axiom system for relative probability which holds for finite and infinite systems and in 
which absolute probability can be defined as in the penultimate formula above Its axioms are

that the limit exists should be inserted between brackets before the word all 

Added  to the proofs of the present volume 

A fairly full treatment of all these questions will now be found in the new addenda to LScD 

I have left this note as in the first publication because I have referred to it in various places The problems dealt 
with in this and the preceding note have since been more fully treated in the new appendices to LScD To its 
 American Edition I have added a system of only three axioms see also section  of the Addenda to the 
present volume 

 

 

 

 

This problem of a propensity interpretation of probability arose out of my interest in Quantum Theory It 
is usually believed that Quantum Theory has to be interpreted statistically and no doubt statistics is essential 
for its empirical tests But this is a point where I believe the dangers of the testability theory of meaning 
become clear Although the tests of the theory are statistical and although the theory say Schrdingers 
equation may imply statistical consequences it need not have a statistical meaning and one can give 
examples of objective propensities which are something like generalized forces and of fields of propensities 
which can be measured by statistical methods without being themselves statistical See also the last 
paragraph of chapter  below with note  
The use of statistics in such cases is in the main to provide empirical tests of theories which need not be 
purely statistical and this raises the question of the refutability of statistical statementsa problem 
treated but not to my full satisfaction in the  edition of my The Logic of Scientific Discovery I later 
found however that all the elements for constructing a satisfactory solution lay ready for use in that book 
certain examples I had given allow a mathematical characterization of a class of infinite chancelike 

 

sequences which are in a certain sense the shortest sequences of their kind  A statistical statement 
may now be said to be testable by comparison with these shortest sequences it is refuted if the statistical 
properties of the tested ensembles differ from the statistical properties of the initial sections of these shortest 
sequences 
There are a number of further problems connected with the interpretation of the formalism of a quantum theory 
In a chapter of The Logic of Scientific Discovery I criticized the official interpretation and I still think that 
my criticism is valid in all points but one one example which I used in section  is mistaken But since I wrote 
that section Einstein Podolski and Rosen have published a thoughtexperiment which can be substituted for 
my example although their tendency which is deterministic is quite different from mine Einsteins belief in 
determinism which I had occasion to discuss with him is I believe unfounded and also unfortunate it robs 
his criticism of much of its force and it must be emphasized that much of his criticism is quite independent of 
his determinism 
As to the problem of determinism itself I have tried to show that even classical physics which is deterministic in 
a certain prima facie sense is misinterpreted if used to support a deterministic view of the physical world in 
Laplaces sense 
In this connection I may also mention the problem of simplicityof the simplicity of a theory which I have 
been able to connect with the content of a theory It can be shown that what is usually called the simplicity of a 
theory is associated with its logical improbability and not with its probability as has often been supposed This 
indeed allows us to deduce from the theory of science outlined above why it is always advantageous to try the 
simplest theories first They are those which offer us the best chance to submit them to severe tests the 
simpler theory has always a higher degree of testability than the more complicated one  Yet I do not think 
that this settles all problems about simplicity See also chapter  section xviii below 
Closely related to this problem is the problem of the ad hoc character of a hypothesis and of degrees of this 
ad hoc character of ad hocness if I may so call it One can show that the methodology of science and 
the history of science also becomes understandable in its details if we assume that the aim of science is to get 
explanatory theories which are as little ad hoc as possible a good theory is not ad hoc while a bad theory 
is On the other hand one can show that the probability theories of induction imply inadvertently but 
necessarily the unacceptable rule always use the theory which is the most ad hoc ie which transcends the 
available evidence as little as possible See also my paper The Aim of Science mentioned in note  
below 
An important problem is the problem of the layers of explanatory hypotheses which we find in the more 
developed theoretical sciences and of 

 
 See LScD p  section  see especially the new appendix XVI 
 Ibid sections  to  But see now also ch  section xviii 

 

 

 

the relations between these layers It is often asserted that Newtons theory can be induced or even deduced 
from Keplers and Galileos laws But it can be shown that Newtons theory including his theory of absolute 
space strictly speaking contradicts Keplers even if we confine ourselves to the twobody problem  and 
neglect the mutual attraction between the planets and also Galileos although approximations to these two 
theories can of course be deduced from Newtons But it is clear that neither a deductive nor an inductive 
inference can lead from consistent premises to a conclusion which contradicts them These considerations 
allow us to analyse the logical relations between layers of theories and also the idea of an approximation 
in the two senses of a The theory x is an approximation to the theory y and b The theory x is a good 
approximation to the facts See also chapter  below 
A host of interesting problems is raised by operationalism the doctrine that theoretical concepts have to be 
defined in terms of measuring operations Against this view it can be shown that measurements 
presuppose theories There is no measurement without a theory and no operation which can be 
satisfactorily described in nontheoretical terms The attempts to do so are always circular for example the 
description of the measurement of length needs a rudimentary theory of heat and temperaturemeasurement 
but these in turn involve measurements of length 

The analysis of operationalism shows the need for a general theory of measurement a theory which 
does not navely take the practice of measuring as given but explains it by analysing its function in the 
testing of scientific hypotheses This can be done with the help of the doctrine of degrees of testability 

Connected with and closely parallel to operationalism is the doctrine of behaviourism ie the doctrine that 
since all teststatements describe behaviour our theories too must be stated in terms of possible behaviour 
But the inference is as invalid as the phenomenalist doctrine which asserts that since all teststatements are 
observational theories too must be stated in terms of possible observations All these doctrines are forms of 
the verifiability theory of meaning that is to say of inductivism 

Closely related to operationalism is instrumentalism ie the interpretation of scientific theories as practical 
instruments or tools for such purposes as the 

 
 The contradictions mentioned in this sentence of the text were pointed out for the case of the manybody 
problem by P Duhem The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory   trans by P P Wiener  
In the case of the twobody problem the contradictions arise in connection with Keplers third law which may be 
reformulated for the twobody problem as follows Let S be any set of pairs of bodies such that one body of 
each pair is of the mass of our sun then a  T  constant for any set S Clearly this contradicts Newtons 
theory which yields for appropriately chosen units a  T  m   m  where m   mass of the sun  constant 
and m l  mass of the second body which varies with this body But a  T  constant is of course an 
excellent approximation provided the varying masses of the second bodies are all negligible compared with that 
of our sun See also my paper The Aim of Science Ratio  pp  ff and section  of the Postscript to 
my Logic of Scientific Discovery 

 

 

prediction of impending events That theories may be used in this way cannot be doubted but instrumentalism 
asserts that they can be best understood as instruments and that this is mistaken I have tried to show by a 
comparison of the differentfunctions of the formulae of applied and pure science In this context the problem 
of the theoretical ie nonpractical function of predictions can also be solved See chapter  section  
below 

It is interesting to analyse from the same point of view the function of languageas an instrument One 
immediate finding of this analysis is that we use descriptive language in order to talk about the world This 
provides new arguments in favour of realism 

Operationalism and instrumentalism must I believe be replaced by theoreticism if I may call it so by the 
recognition of the fact that we are always operating within a complex framework of theories and that we do not 
aim simply at correlations but at explanations 

The problem of explanation itself It has often been said that scientific explanation is reduction of the 
unknown to the known If pure science is meant nothing could be further from the truth It can be said without 
paradox that scientific explanation is on the contrary the reduction of the known to the unknown In pure 
science as opposed to an applied science which takes pure science as given or known explanation is always 
the logical reduction of hypotheses to others which are of a higher level of universality of known facts and 
known theories to assumptions of which we know very little as yet and which have still to be tested The 
analysis of degrees of explanatory power and of the relationship between genuine and sham explanation and 
between explanation and prediction are examples of problems which are of great interest in this context 
This brings me to the problem of the relationship between explanation in the natural sciences and historical 
explanation which strangely enough is logically somewhat analogous to the problem of explanation in the 
pure and applied sciences and to the vast field of problems in the methodology of the social sciences 
especially the problems of historical prediction historicism and historical determinism and 
historical relativism These problems are linked again with the more general problems of determinism and 
relativism including the problems of linguistic relativism  
A further problem of interest is the analysis of what is called scientific objectivity I have treated this problem in 
several places especially in connection with a criticism of the socalled sociology of knowledge  
One type of solution of the problem of induction should be mentioned here again see section iv above in 
order to warn against it Solutions of this kind are as a rule put forth without a clear formulation of the problem 
which they are supposed to solve The view I have in mind may be described 

 
 See my Poverty of Historicism  sections  and note  to  also the Addendum to vol ii of my 
Open Society added to the th edition  
 Poverty of Historicism section  LScD section  Open Society ch  The passages are 
complementary 

 

 

as follows It is first taken for granted that nobody seriously doubts that we do in fact make inductions and 
successful ones My suggestion that this is a myth and that the apparent cases of induction turn out if 
analysed more carefully to be cases of the method of trial and error is treated with the contempt which an 
utterly unreasonable suggestion of this kind deserves It is then said that the task of a theory of induction is to 
describe and classify our inductive policies or procedures and perhaps to point out which of them are the most 
successful and reliable ones and which are less successful or reliable and that any further question of 
justification is misplaced Thus the view I have in mind is characterized by the contention that the distinction 
between the factual problem of describing how we argue inductively quid facti and the problem of the 
justification of our inductive arguments quid jurisis a misplaced distinction It is also said that the 
justification required is unreasonable since we cannot expect inductive arguments to be valid in the same 
sense in which deductive ones may be valid induction simply is not deduction and it is unreasonable to 
demand from it that it should conform to the standards of logicalthat is deductivevalidity We must therefore 
judge it by its own standardsby inductive standardsof reasonableness 

I think that this defence of induction is mistaken It not only takes a myth for a fact and the alleged fact for a 
standard of rationality with the result that a myth becomes a standard of rationality but it also propagates in 
this way a principle which may be used to defend any dogma against any criticism Moreover it mistakes the 
status of formal or deductive logic It mistakes it just as much as those who saw it as the systematization of 
our factual that is psychological laws of thought For deduction I contend is not valid because we choose or 
decide to adopt its rules as a standard or decree that they shall be accepted rather it is valid because it 
adopts and incorporates the rules by which truth is transmitted from logically stronger premises to logically 
weaker conclusions and by which falsity is retransmitted from conclusions to premises This retransmission 
of falsity makes formal logic the Organon of rational criticismthat is of refutation 

One point that may be conceded to those who hold the view I am criticizing here is this In arguing from 
premises to the conclusion or in what may be called the deductive direction we argue from the truth or the 
certainty or the probability of the premises to the corresponding property of the conclusion while if we argue 
from the conclusion to the premises and thus in what we have called the inductive direction we argue from 
the falsity or the uncertainty or the impossibility or the improbability of the conclusion to the corresponding 
property of the premises accordingly we must indeed concede that standards such as more especially 
certainty which apply to arguments in the deductive direction do not also apply to arguments in the inductive 
direction Yet even this concession of mine turns in the end against those who hold the view which I am 
criticizing here for they assume wrongly that we may argue in the inductive direction though not to the 
certainty yet to the probability of our generalizations But this assumption 

 

 

is taken for all the intuitive ideas of probability which have ever been suggested  

This is a list of just a few of the problems of the philosophy of science to which I was led in my pursuit of the two 
fertile and fundamental problems se story I have tried to tell you

in this appendix has grown considerably and some more recent contributions which deal with problems not listed

THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS AND THEIR ROOTS 
IN SCIENCE 
I 

IT WAS after some hesitation that I decided to take as my point of departure the present position of English 
philosophy For I believe that the function of a scientist or of a philosopher is to solve scientific or philosophical 
problems rather than to talk about what he or other philosophers are doing or might do Any unsuccessful attempt to 
solve a scientific or philosophical problem if it is an honest and devoted attempt appears to me more significant than 
a discussion of such a question as What is science or What is philosophy And even if we put this latter question 
as we should in the slightly better form What is the character of philosophical problems I for one should not 
bother much about it I should feel that it had little weight even compared with such a minor problem of philosophy as 
the question whether every discussion or every criticism must always proceed from assumptions or suppositions 
which themselves are beyond argument  

When describing What is the character of philosophical problems as a slightly better form of What is philosophy I 
wished to hint at one of the reasons for the futility of the current controversy concerning the nature of philosophy the 
nave belief that there is an entity such as philosophy or perhaps philosophical activity and that it has a certain 
character or essence or nature The belief that there is such a thing as physics or biology or 

 

 I call this a minor problem because I believe that it can easily be solved by refuting the relativistic doctrine 
which gives rise to the question Thus the answer to the question is negative See the Addendum to vol ii of my 
Open Society added to the fourth edition of  

 

archaelogy and that these studies or disciplines are distinguishable by the subect matter which they investigate 
appears to me to be a residue from the time when one believed that a theory had to proceed from a definition of its 
own subject matter  But subject matter or kinds of things do not I hold constitute a basis for distinguishing 
disciplines Disciplines are distinguished partly for historical reasons and reasons of administrative convenience such 
as the organization of teaching and of appointments and partly because the theories which we construct to solve our 
problems have a tendency  to grow into unified systems But all this classification and distinction is a comparatively 
unimportant and superficial affair We are not students of some subject matter but students of 
problems And problems may cut right across the border of any subject matter or discipline 

Obvious as this fact may appear to some people it is so important for our present discussion that it is worth while 
illustrating it by an example I need hardly mention that a geologists problem such as assessing the chances of 
finding deposits of oil or uranium in a certain district has to be solved with the help of theories and techniques usually 
classified as mathematical physical and chemical It is however less obvious that even a more basic science such 
as atomic physics may have to make use of a geological survey and of geological theories and techniques to solve 
a problem in one of its most abstract and fundamental theories for example the problem of testing predictions about 
the relative stability or instability of atoms of an even or odd atomic number 

I am quite ready to admit that many problems even if their solution involves the most diverse disciplines 
nevertheless belong in some sense to one or another of the traditional disciplines the two problems just mentioned 
clearly belong to geology and physics respectively This is because each of them arises out of a discussion 
characteristic of the tradition of the discipline in question It arises out of the discussion of some theory or out of 
empirical test bearing upon a theory and theories as opposed to subject matter may constitute a discipline which 
might be described as a somewhat loose cluster of theories undergoing challenge change and growth But this 
does not affect my point that the classification into disciplines is comparatively unimportant and that we are students 
not of disciplines but of problems 

But are there philosophical problems The present position of English philosophymy point of departure
originates I believe in the late Professor Ludwig Wittgensteins doctrine that there are none that all genuine 
problems are scientific problems that the alleged problems of philosophy are pseudoproblems that the alleged 
propositions or theories of philosophy are pseudopropositions or pseudotheories that they are not false if they 
were 

 

 This view is part of what I have called essentialism Cf for example my Open Society chs  and  or The 
Poverty of Historicism section  
 This tendency can be explained by the principle that theoretical explanations are the more satisfactory the better 
they can be supported by independent evidence For in order to be supported by mutually independent pieces 
of evidence a theory must be sweeping 

 

 

 

false their negations would be true propositions or theories but strictly meaningless combinations of words  no 
more meaningful than the incoherent babbling of a child who has not yet learned to speak properly  

As a consequence philosophy cannot contain any theories Its true nature according to Wittgenstein is not that of a 
theory but that of an activity The task of all genuine philosophy is to unmask philosophical nonsense and to teach 
people to talk sense 

My plan is to take this doctrine  of Wittgensteins as my starting point I shall try to explain it in section ii to defend 
it to some extent and to criticize it in section iii And I shall illustrate all this in sections iv to x by some examples 
from the history of scientific ideas 

But before proceeding to carry out this plan I wish to reaffirm my conviction that a philosopher should philosophize 
he should try to solve philosophical problems rather than talk about philosophy If Wittgensteins doctrine is true then 
nobody can philosophize in my sense Were this my opinion I would give up philosophy But it so happens that I am 
not only deeply interested in certain philosophical problems I do not much care whether they are rightly called 
philosophical problems but possessed by the hope that I may contributeif only a little and only by hard work to 
their solution My only excuse for talking here about philosophyinstead of philosophizingis my hope that in carrying 
out my programme for this address an opportunity may turn up to do a little philosophizing after all 

 

 All animals are equal but some are more equal than others is an excellent example of an expression which would 
be meaningless in the technical sense of Russell and Wittgenstein though clearly far from meaningless in the 
sense of pointless in the context of Orwell Animal Farm It is interesting that later Orwell considered the 
possibility of introducing a language and enforcing its use in which All men are equal would become 
meaningless in Wittgensteins technical sense 
 Since Wittgenstein described his own Tractatus as meaningless see also the next footnote he distinguished 
at least by implication between revealing or important and worthless or unimportant nonsense But this does not 
affect his main doctrine which I am discussing the nonexistence of philosophical problems A discussion of 
other doctrines of Wittgensteins can be found in the Notes to my Open Society especially notes    
and  to ch  
 It is easy to detect at once one flaw in this doctrine the doctrine it may be said is itself a philosophic theory 
claiming to be true and not to be meaningless This criticism however is perhaps a little cheap It might be 
countered in at least two ways  One might say that the doctrine is indeed meaningless qua doctrine but not 
qua activity This is the view of Wittgenstein who said at the end of his Tractatus LogicoPhilosophicus 
that whoever understood the book must realize at the end that it was itself meaningless and must discard it like a 
ladder after having used it to reach the desired height  One might say that the doctrine is not a philosophical 
but an empirical one that it states the historical fact that all apparent theories proposed by philosophers are in 
fact ungrammatical that these do not in fact conform to the rules inherent in those languages in which they 
appear to be formulated that it turns out to be impossible to remedy this defect and that every attempt to express 
them properly has led to the loss of their philosophic character and revealed them as for example empirical 
truisms or as false statements These two counter arguments do I believe rescue the threatened consistency of 
the doctrine which in this way indeed becomes unassailableto use Wittgensteins termby the kind of criticism 
referred to in this note See also the next note but one 

 

 

II 
Ever since the rise of Hegelianism there has existed a dangerous gulf between science and philosophy Philosophers 
were accusedrightly I believeof philosophizing without knowledge of fact and their philosophies were described 
as mere fancies even imbecile fancies  Although Hegelianism was the leading influence in England and on the 
Continent opposition to it and contempt of its pretentiousness never died out completely Its downfall was brought 
about by a philosopher who like Leibniz Kant and J S Mill before him had a sound knowledge of science and 
especially of mathematics I am speaking of Bertrand Russell Russell is also the author of the classification closely 
related to his famous theory of types which is the basis of Wittgensteins view of philosophy the classification of 
the expressions of a language into 

True statements 
False statements 
Meaningless expressions among which there are statementlike sequences of words which may be 
called pseudostatements 

Russell used this distinction to solve the problem of the logical paradoxes which he discovered For his solution it was 
essential to distinguish more especially between  and  We might say in ordinary speech that a false statement 
like  times  equals  or All cats are cows is meaningless Russell however reserved the term meaningless 
for expressions such as  times  are cows or All cats equal  that is for expressions of a sort which it is better 
not to describe as false statements They are better not described as false because the negation of a meaningful but 
false statement will always be true But the prima facie negation of the pseudostatement All cats equal  is 
Some cats do not equal  and this is just as unsatisfactory a pseudostatement as the original statement 
Negations of pseudostatements are again pseudostatements just as negations of proper statements 
true or false are proper statements false or true respectively 

This distinction allowed Russell to eliminate the paradoxes which he said were meaningless pseudostatements 
Wittgenstein went further Led perhaps by the feeling that what philosophers especially Hegelian philosophers were 
saying was somewhat similar to the paradoxes of logic he used Russells distinction in order to denounce all 
philosophy as strictly meaningless 

As a result there could be no genuine philosophical problems All alleged philosophical problems could be classified 
under four heads   those which 

 

 The two quotations are not the words of a scientific critic but ironically enough Hegels own characterization of 
the philosophy of his friend and forerunner Schelling Cf my Open Society note  and text to ch  
 Wittgenstein still upheld the doctrine of the nonexistence of philosophical problems in the form here described 
when I saw him last in  when he presided over a stormy meeting of the Moral Sciences Club in Cambridge 
on the occasion of my reading a paper on Are there Philosophical Problems Since I had never seen any of 
his unpublished manuscripts which were privately circulated by some of his pupils I had been wondering whether 
he had modified what I here call his doctrine but on this the most fundamental and influential part of his 
teaching I found his views unchanged 

 

are purely logical or mathematical to be answered by logical or mathematical propositions and therefore not 
philosophical  those which are factual to be answered by some statement belonging to empirical science and 
therefore again not philosophical  those which are combinations of  and  and therefore again not 
philosophical and  meaningless pseudoproblems such as Do all cats equal   or Is Socrates identical  or 
Does an invisible untouchable and apparently altogether unknowable Socrates exist 

Wittgensteins idea of eradicating philosophy and theology with the help of an adaptation of Russells theory of types 
was ingenious and original and more radical even than Comtes positivism which it resembles closely  This idea 
became the inspiration of the powerful modern school of language analysts who have inherited his belief that there 
are no genuine philosophical problems and that all a philosopher can do is to unmask and dissolve the linguistic 
puzzles which have been proposed by traditional philosophy 

My own view of the matter is that only as long as I have genuine philosophical problems to solve shall I continue to 
take an interest in philosophy I fail to understand the attraction of a philosophy without problems I know of course 
that many people talk nonsense and it is conceivable that it should become ones task an unpleasant one to 
unmask somebodys nonsense for it may be dangerous nonsense But I believe that some people have said things 
which were not very good sense and certainly not very good grammar but which were all the same highly interesting 
and exciting and perhaps more worth listening to than the good sense of others I may mention the differential and 
integral calculus which especially in its early forms was no doubt completely paradoxical and nonsensical by 
Wittgensteins and other standards which became however reasonably well founded as the result of some 
hundred years of great mathematical efforts but whose foundations even at this very moment are still in need and in 
the process of clarification  We might remember in this context that it was the contrast between the apparent 
absolute precision of mathematics and the vagueness and imprecision of philosophical language which deeply 
impressed the earlier followers of Wittgenstein But had there been a Wittgenstein to use his weapons against the 
pioneers of the calculus and had he succeeded in eliminating their nonsense where their contemporary critics such 
as Berkeley who was fundamentally right failed he would have strangled one of the most fascinating and 
philosophically important developments in the history of thought Wittgenstein once wrote Whereof one cannot 
speak thereof one must be 

 
 I am alluding to G Kreisels recent construction  Journal of Symbolic Logic    of a monotone 
bounded sequence of rationals every term of which can be actually computed but which does not possess a 
computable limitin contradiction to what appears to be the prima facie interpretation of the classical theorem of 
Bolzano and Weierstrass but in agreement with Brouwers doubts about this theorem 
 Cf note   to ch  of my Open Society 

 

 

 

silent It was if I remember rightly Erwin Schroedinger who replied But it is only here that speaking becomes worth 
while The history of the calculusand perhaps of Schroedingers own theory  bears him out 

No doubt we should all train ourselves to speak as clearly as precisely as simply and as directly as we can Yet I 
believe that there is not a classic of science or of mathematics or indeed a book worth reading that could not be 
shown by a skilful application of the technique of language analysis to contain many meaningless pseudo
propositions and what some people might call tautologies 

Moreover I believe that even Wittgensteins original adaptation of Russells theory rests upon a logical mistake From 
the point of view of modern logic there no longer appears to be any justification for speaking of pseudostatements or 
type mistakes or categorymistakes within ordinary naturally grown languages as opposed to artificial calculi so 
long as the conventional rules of custom and grammar are observed One may even say that the positivist who tells 
us with the air of the initiated that we are using meaningless words or that we are talking nonsense literally does not 
know what he is talking abouthe simply repeats what he has heard from others who also dont know But this raises 
a technical question which I cannot deal with here It is dealt with however in chapters  and  below 

III 

I have promised to say something in defence of Wittgensteins views What I wish to say is first that there is much 
philosophical writing especially in the Hegelian school which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage 
secondly that this kind of irresponsible writing was checked for a time at least by the influence of Wittgenstein and 
the language analysts although it is likely that the most wholesome influence in this respect was the example of 
Russell who by the incomparable charm and clarity of his writings established the fact that sublety of content is 
compatible with lucidity and unpretentiousness of style 

But I am prepared to admit more In partial defence of Wittgensteins views I am prepared to defend the following two 
theses 

My first thesis is that every philosophy and especially every philosophical school is liable to degenerate in such a 
way that its problems become practically indistinguishable from pseudoproblems and its cant accordingly 
practically indistinguishable from meaningless babble This I shall try to show is a consequence of philosophical 
inbreeding The degeneration of philosophical schools is in its turn the consequence of the mistaken belief that one 
can philosophize without being compelled to turn to philosophy by 

 
 Before Max Born proposed his famous probability interpretation Schroedingers wave equation was some might 
contend meaningless This is not however my opinion of it 

After this paper was first published Schroedinger told me that he could not remember saying this and that he did 
not believe that he ever said it But he liked the remark 

 

 

problems which arise outside philosophyin mathematics for example or in cosmology or in politics or in 
religion or in social life In other words my first thesis is this Genuine philosophical problems are always 
rooted in urgent problems outside philosophy and they die if these roots decay In their efforts to 
solve them philosophers are liable to pursue what looks like a philosophical method or technique or an unfailing key 
to philosophical success  But no such methods or techniques exist in philosophy methods are unimportant any 
method is legitimate if it leads to results capable of being rationally discussed What matters is not methods or 
techniques but a sensitivity to problems and a consuming passion for them or as the Greeks said the gift of 
wonder 

There are those who feel the urge to solve a problem those for whom a problem becomes real like a disorder which 
they have to get out of their system  They may make a contribution even if they bind themselves to a particular 
method or a technique But there are others who do not feel this urge who have no serious and pressing problem but 
who nevertheless produce exercises in fashionable methods and for whom philosophy is application of whatever 
insight or technique you like rather than search They are luring philosophy into the bog of pseudoproblems and 
verbal puzzles either by offering us pseudoproblems for real ones the danger which Wittgenstein saw or by 
persuading us to concentrate upon the endless and pointless task of unmasking what they rightly or wrongly take for 
pseudoproblems or puzzles the trap into which Wittgenstein fell 

My second thesis is that what appears to be the prima facie method of teaching philosophy is liable to produce a 
philosophy which answers Wittgensteins description What I mean by prima facie method of teaching philosophy 
and what would seem to be the only method is that of giving the beginner whom we take to be unaware of the 
history of mathematical cosmological and other ideas of science as well as of politics the works of the great 
philosophers to read the works say of Plato and Aristotle Descartes and Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume Kant and 
Mill What is the effect of such a course of reading A new world of astonishingly subtle and vast abstractions 
opens itself before the reader abstractions on an extremely high and difficult level Thoughts and arguments are put 
before his mind which sometimes are not only hard to understand but which seem to him irrelevant because he 
cannot find out what they may be relevant to Yet the student knows that these are the great philosophers that this is 
the way of philosophy Thus he will make an effort 

 
 It is very interesting that the imitators were always inclined to believe that the master did his work with the help of 
a secret method or a trick It is reported that in J S Bachs days some musicians believed that he possessed a 
secret formula for the construction of fugue themes 

It is also interesting to note that all the philosophies which have become fashionable so far as I am aware have 
offered their disciples a kind of method for producing philosophical results This is true of Hegelian essentialism 
which teaches its adherents to produce essays on the essence or nature or idea of everythingthe soul the 
universe or the University it is true of Husserls phenomenology of existentialism and also of language analysis 

 I am alluding to a remark by Professor Gilbert Ryle who says on page  of his Concept of Mind Primarily I 
am trying to get some disorders out of my own system 

 

 

to adjust his mind to what he believes mistakenly as we shall see to be their way of thinking He will attempt to 
speak their queer language to match the tortuous spirals of their argumentation and perhaps even tie himself up in 
their curious knots Some may learn these tricks in a superficial way others may begin to become genuinely 
fascinated addicts Yet I feel that we ought to respect the man who having made his effort comes ultimately to what 
may be described as Wittgensteins conclusion I have learned the jargon as well as anybody It is very clever and 
captivating In fact it is dangerously captivating for the simple truth about the matter is that it is much ado about 
nothing just a lot of nonsense 

Now I believe such a conclusion to be grossly mistaken yet it is the almost inescapable outcome I contend of the 
prima facie method of teaching philosophy here described I do not deny of course that some particularly gifted 
students may find very much more in the works of the great philosophers than this story indicatesand without self
deception For the students chance of discovering the extraphilosophical problems mathematical scientific moral 
and political problems which inspired these great philosophers is very small indeed As a rule these problems can 
be discovered only by studying the history of for example scientific ideas and especially the problemsituation in 
mathematics and the sciences during the period in question and this in turn presupposes a considerable 
acquaintance with mathematics and science Only if he understands the contemporary problemsituation in the 
sciences can the student of the great philosophers understand that they tried to solve urgent and concrete problems 
problems which they found could not be dismissed And only after understanding this can the student attain a 
different picture of the great philosophiesone which makes sense of the apparent nonsense 

I shall try to establish my two theses with the help of examples but before turning to these examples I wish to 
summarize my theses and to balance my account with Wittgenstein 

My two theses amount to the contention that as philosophy is deeply rooted in nonphilosophical problems 
Wittgensteins negative judgment is correct by and large so far as philosophies are concerned which have forgotten 
their extraphilosophical roots and that these roots are easily forgotten by philosophers who study philosophy 
instead of being forced into philosophy by the pressure of nonphilosophical problems 

My view of Wittgensteins doctrine may be summed up as follows It is perhaps true by and large that pure 
philosophical problems do not exist for indeed the purer a philosophical problem becomes the more is lost of its 
original significance and the more liable is its discussion to degenerate into empty verbalism On the other hand 
there exist not only genuine scientific problems but genuine philosophical problems Even if upon analysis these 
problems turn out to have factual components they need not be classified as belonging to science And even if they 
should be soluble by say purely logical means they need not be classified as purely logical or tautological 
Analogous 

 

 

situations arise in physics For example the problem of explaining certain spectral terms with the help of a 
hypothesis concerning the structure of atoms may turn out to be soluble by purely mathematical calculations But this 
again does not imply that the problem belonged to pure mathematics rather than to physics We are perfectly justified 
in calling a problem physical if it is connected with problems and theories which have been traditionally discussed by 
physicists such as the problem of the constitution of matter even if the means used for its solution turn out to be 
purely mathematical As we have seen the solution of problems may cut through the boundary of many sciences 
Similarly a problem may rightly be called philosophical if we find that although originally it arose in connection with 
say atomic theory it is more closely connected with the problems and theories which have been discussed by 
philosophers than with theories nowadays treated by physicists And again it does not matter in the least what kind of 
methods we use in solving such a problem Cosmology for example will always be of great philosophical interest 
even though in some of its methods it has become closely allied with what is perhaps better called physics To say 
that since it deals with factual issues it must belong to science rather than to philosophy is not only pedantic but 
clearly the result of an epistemological and thus of a philosophical dogma Similarly there is no reason why a 
problem soluble by logical means should be denied the attribute philosophical It may well be typically philosophical 
or physical or biological Logical analysis played a considerable part in Einsteins special theory of relativity and it 
was partly this fact which made the theory philosophically interesting and which gave rise to a wide range of 
philosophical problems connected with it 

Wittgensteins doctrine turns out to be the result of the thesis that all genuine statements and therefore all genuine 
problems can be classified into one of two exclusive classes factual statements synthetic a posteriori to be 
treated by the empirical sciences and logical statements analytic a priori to be treated by pure formal logic or 
pure mathematics This simple dichotomy although extremely valuable for a rough survey turns out to be for many 
purposes too simple  But although it is specially designed as it were to exclude the existence of philosophical 
problems it falls considerably short of 

 
 Already in my LScD of   had pointed out that a theory such as Newtons may be interpreted either as 
factual or as consisting of implicit definitions in the sense of Poincar and Eddington and that the interpretation 
which a physicist adopts exhibits itself in his attitude towards tests which go against his theory rather than in 
what he says I also pointed out that there are nonanalytical theories which are not testable and therefore not a 
posteriori but which had a great influence on science Examples are the early atomic theory or the early 
theory of action by contact I called such untestable theories metaphysical and asserted that they were not 
meaningless The dogma of the simple dichotomy has been recently attacked on very different lines by F H 
Heinemann  Proc of the Xth Intern Congress of Philosophy Fasc   Amsterdam  by W 
V Quine and by Morton G White It may be remarked again from a different point of view that the dichotomy 
applies in a precise sense only to a formalized language and therefore is liable to break down for those 
languages in which we must speak prior to any formalization ie in those languages in which all the traditional 
problems were conceived 

 

 

this aim for even if we accept the dichotomy we can still claim that factual or logical or mixed problems may turn out 
in certain circumstances to be philosophical 

IV 

I now turn to my first example Plato and the Crisis in Early Greek Atomism 

My thesis here is that Platos central philosophical doctrine the socalled Theory of Forms or Ideas cannot be 
properly understood except in an extraphilosophical context  more especially in the context of the critical problem 
situation in Greek science  mainly in the theory of matter which developed as a result of the discovery of the 
irrationality of the square root of two If my thesis is correct Platos theory has not so far been fully 
understood Whether a full understanding can ever be achieved is of course most questionable But a more 
important consequence would be that it can never be understood by philosophers trained in accordance with the 
prima facie method described in the foregoing sectionunless of course they are specially and ad hoc informed 
of the relevant facts These they may have to accept on authoritywhich means abandoning the prima facie 
method of teaching philosophy described above 

It seems likely  that Platos Theory of Forms is both in origin and in content closely connected with the Pythagorean 
theory that all things are in essence numbers The details of this connection and the connection between Atomism 
and Pythagoreanism are perhaps not so well known I will therefore briefly tell the story here as I see it at present 

It appears that the founder of the Pythagorean order or sect was deeply 

 
 In my Open Society and its Enemies I have tried to explain in some detail another extraphilosophical root 
of the same doctrineits political root I also discussed there in note  to ch  of the revised th edn  the 
problem with which I am concerned in the present section but from a somewhat different angle The note referred 
to and the present section overlap a little but they largely supplement each other Relevant references especially 
to Plato omitted here will be found there 
 There are historians who deny that the term science can be properly applied to any development which is older 
than the sixteenth or even the seventeenth century But quite apart from the fact that controversies about labels 
should be avoided there can I believe no longer be any doubt nowadays about the astonishing similarity not to 
say identity of the aims interests activities arguments and methods of say Galileo and Archimedes or 
Copernicus and Plato or Kepler and Aristarchus the Copernicus of antiquity And any doubt concerning the 
extreme age of scientific observation and of careful computations based upon observation has been dispelled by 
the discovery of new evidence concerning the history of ancient astronomy We can now draw a parallel not only 
between Tycho and Hipparchus but even between Hansen   and Cidenas the Chaldean   BC whose 
computations of the constants for the motion of Sun and Moon are without exception comparable in precision to 
those of the best nineteenthcentury astronomers  Cidenas value for the motion of the Sun from the Node  
to great although inferior to Browns is superior to at least one of the most widely used modern values wrote J 
K Fotheringham in  in his admirable article The Indebtedness of Greek to Chaldean Astronomy  The 
Observatory   No  upon which my contention concerning the age of metrical astronomy is 
based 

 If we may trust Aristotles famous account in his Metaphysics 

 

 

impressed by two discoveries The first was that a prima facie purely qualitative phenomenon such as musical 
harmony was in essence based upon the purely numerical ratios    The second was that the right or 
straight angle obtainable for example by folding a leaf twice so that the two folds form a cross was connected with 
the purely numerical ratios  or  the sides of rectangular triangles These two discoveries it appears led 
Pythagoras to the somewhat fantastic generalization that all things are in essence numbers or ratios of numbers or 
that number is the ratio logos  reason the rational essence of things or their real nature 

Fantastic as this idea was it proved fruitful in many ways One of its most successful applications was to simple 
geometrical figures such as squares rectangular and isosceles triangles and also to certain simple solids such as 
pyramids The treatment of some of these geometrical problems was based upon the socalled gnmn 

This can be explained as follows If we indicate a square by four dots 

 

we may interpret this as the result of adding three dots to the one dot on the upper left corner These three dots are 
the first gnmn we may indicate it thus 

By adding a second gnmn consisting of five more dots we obtain 

 

 

One sees at once that every number of the sequence of odd numbers         forms the gnmn of a 
square and that the sums                    are the square numbers and that if n is the number 
of dots in the side of a square its area total number of dots  n will be equal to the sum of the first n odd 
numbers 

As with the treatment of squares so with the treatment of equilateral triangles The following figure may be regarded 
as representing a growing 

 

 

trianglegrowing downwards through the addition of ever new horizontal lines of dots 

Here each gnMn is a last horizontal line of dots and each element of the sequence        is a gnmn 
The triangular numbers are the sums                 etc that is the sums of the first n natural 
numbers By putting two such triangles side by side 

 

we obtain the parallelogram with the horizontal side n   and the other side n containing nn   dots Since it 
consists of two isosceles triangles its number is         n so that we obtain the equation 

 

 

From this it is easy to obtain the general formula for the sum of an arithmetical series 

We also obtain oblong numbers that is the numbers of oblong rectangular figures of which the simplest is 

 

 

 

with the oblong numbers          the gnmn of an oblong is an even number and the oblong numbers are 
the sums of the even numbers 

These considerations were extended to solids for example by summing the first triangular numbers pyramid 
numbers were obtained But the main application was to plane figures or shapes or Forms These were believed to 
be characterized by the appropriate sequence of numbers and thus by the numerical ratios of the consecutive 
numbers of the sequence In other words Forms are numbers or ratios of numbers On the other hand not 
only shapes of things but also abstract properties such as harmony and straightness are numbers In this way the 
general theory that numbers are the rational essences of all things is arrived at 

It seems probable that the development of this view was influenced by the similarity of the dotdiagrams with the 
diagram of a constellation such as the Lion or the Scorpion or the Virgo If a Lion is an arrangement of dots it must 
have a number In this way Pythagoreanism seems to be connected with the belief that the numbers or Forms are 
heavenly shapes of things 

V 

One of the main elements of this early theory was the socalled Table of Opposites based upon the fundamental 
distinction between odd and even numbers It contains such things as 

ONE 
ODD 
MALE 
REST BEING 
DETERMINATE 
SQUARE 

MANY 
EVEN 
FEMALE 
CHANGE BECOMING 
INDETERMINATE 
OBLONG 

STRAIGHT 
RIGHT 
LIGHT 
GOOD 

CROOKED 
LEFT 
DARKNESS 
BAD 

In reading through this strange table one gets some idea of the working of the Pythagorean mind and why not only 
the Forms or shapes of geometrical figures were considered to be numbers in essence but also abstract ideas 
such as Justice and of course Harmony and Health Beauty and Knowledge The table is interesting also because it 
was taken over with very little alteration by Plato The earliest version of Platos famous theory of Forms or Ideas 
may indeed be described somewhat roughly as the doctrine that the Good side of the Table of Opposites 
constitutes an invisible Universe a Universe of Higher Reality of the Unchanging and Determinate Forms of all 
things and that True and Certain Knowledge epistm  scientia  science can be of this Unchanging and 
Real Universe only while the visible world of change and flux in which we live and die the world of generation and 
destruction the world of experience is only a kind of reflection or copy of that Real World It is only a world of 
appearance of which no True and Certain Knowledge can be obtained All that can be obtained in the place of 
Knowledge epistm are the plausible but uncertain and prejudiced opinions doxa of fallible mor 

 

 

tals  In his interpretation of the Table of Opposites Plato was influenced by Parmenides the man whose challenge 
led to the development of Democritus atomic theory 

VI 

The Pythagorean theory with its dotdiagrams contains no doubt the suggestion of a very primitive atomism How far 
the atomic theory of Democritus was influenced by Pythagoreanism is difficult to assess Its main influences came so 
much seems certain from the Eleatic School from Parmenides and from Zeno The basic problem of this school and 
of Democritus was that of the rational understanding of change I differ here from the interpretations of Cornford 
and others I think that this problem derives from Heraclitus and thus from Ionian rather than from Pythagorean 
thought  and that it still remains the fundamental problem of Natural Philosophy 

Although Parmenides was perhaps not a physicist unlike his great Ionian predecessors he may be described I 
believe as having fathered theoretical physics He produced an antiphysical  rather than aphysical as 
Aristotle said theory which however was the first hypotheticodeductive system And it was the beginning of a long 
series of such systems of physical theories each of which was an improvement on its predecessor As a rule the 
improvement was found necessary because it was realized that the earlier system was falsified by certain facts of 
experience Such an empirical refutation of the consequences of a deductive system leads to efforts at its 
reconstruction and thus to a new and improved theory which as a rule clearly bears the marks of its ancestry of the 
older theory as well as of the refuting experience 

 

 Platos distinction epistm vs doxa is derived through Parmenides from Xenophanes truth vs 
conjecture or seeming Plato clearly realized that all knowledge of the visible world the changing world of 
appearance consists of doxa that it is tainted by uncertainty even if it utilizes the epistm the knowledge of 
the unchanging Forms and of pure mathematics to the utmost and even if it interprets the visible world with the 
help of a theory of the invisible world Cf Cratylus b ff Republic d ff and especially Timaeus b 
ff where the distinction is applied to those parts of Platos own theory which we should nowadays call physics or 
cosmology or more generally natural science They belong Plato says to the realm of doxa in spite of the 
fact that science  scientia  epistm cf my remarks on this problem in ch  below For a different view 
concerning Platos relation to Parmenides see Sir David Ross Platos Theory of Ideas Oxford  p  
 Karl Reinhardt in his Parmenides   second edition  p  says very forcefully The history of 
philosophy is a history of its problems If you want to explain Heraclitus tell us first what his problem was I fully 
agree and I believe as against Reinhardt that Heraclitus problem was the problem of changeor more 
precisely of the selfidentity and nonidentity of the changing thing during change See also my Open 
Society ch  If we accept Reinhardts evidence about the close link between Heraclitus and Parmenides then 
this view of Heraclitus problem makes of Parmenides system an attempt to solve the problem of the paradoxes 
of change by making change unreal As against this Cornford and his disciples follow Burnets doctrine that 
Parmenides was a dissident Pythagorean This may well be true but the evidence in its favour does not show 
that he did not also have an Ionian teacher See also ch  below 

 Cp Plato Theaetetus a and Sextus Empiricus Adv Mathem Bekker X  p   

 

 

These experiences or observations were we shall see very crude at first but they became more and more subtle as 
the theories became more and more capable of accounting for the cruder observations In the case of Parmenides 
theory the clash with observation was so obvious that it would seem perhaps fanciful to describe the theory as the 
first hypotheticodeductive system of physics We may therefore describe it as the last prephysical deductive 
system whose refutation or falsification gave rise to the first physical theory of matter the atomistic theory of 
Democritus Parmenides theory is simple He finds it impossible to understand change or movement rationally and 
concludes that there is really no changeor that change is only apparent But before we indulge in feelings of 
superiority in the face of such a hopelessly unrealistic theory we should first realize that there is a serious problem 
here If a thing X changes then clearly it is no longer the same thing X On the other hand we cannot say that X 
changes without implying that X persists during the change that it is the same thing X at the beginning and at the 
end of the change Thus it appears that we arrive at a contradiction and that the idea of a thing that changes and 
therefore the idea of change is impossibleAll this sounds very philosophical and abstract and so it is But it is a fact 
that the difficulty here indicated has never ceased to make itself felt in the development of physics  And a 
deterministic system such as the field theory of Einstein might even be described as a fourdimensional version of 
Parmenides unchanging threedimensional universe For in a sense no change occurs in Einsteins fourdimensional 
blockuniverse Everything is there just as it is in its fourdimensional locus change becomes a kind of apparent 
change it is only the observer who as it were glides along his worldline and becomes successively conscious of the 
different loci along this worldline that is of his spatiotemporal surroundings   To return from this new Parmenides 
to the older father of theoretical physics we may paraphrase his deductive theory roughly as follows 
  Only what is is 
  What is not does not exist 
 
 

Nonbeing that is the void does not exist 
The world is full 

The world has no parts it is one huge block because it is full 

 
  Motion is impossible since there is no empty space into which anything could move 
 
 This may be seen from Emile Meyerson Identity and Reality one of the most interesting philosophical studies 
of the development of physical theories Hegel following Heraclitus or Aristotles account of him took the fact of 
change which he considered selfcontradictory to prove the existence of contradictions in the world and 
therefore to disprove the law of contradiction ie the principle that our theories must avoid contradictions at all 
cost Hegel and his followers especially Engels Lenin and other Marxists began to see contradictions 
everywhere in the world and denounced all philosophies upholding the law of contradiction as metaphysical a 
term which they used to imply that these philosophies ignore the fact that the world changes See ch  below 

 

 

The conclusions  and  were obviously contradicted by facts Thus Democritus argued from the falsity of the 
conclusion to that of the premises 

 There is motion thus motion is possible 
 The world has parts it is not one but many 
 Thus the world cannot be full  
 The void or nonbeing exists 

So far the theory had to be altered With regard to being or to the many existing things as opposed to the void 
Democritus adopted Parmenides theory that they had no parts They were indivisible atoms because they were 
full because they had no void inside 

The main point about this theory is that it gives a rational account of change The world consists of empty space the 
void with atoms in it The atoms do not change they are Parmenidean indivisible block universes in miniature  All 
change is due to rearrangement of atoms in space Accordingly all change is movement Since the only kind of 
novelty which can arise on this view is novelty of arrangement  it will be possible in principle to predict all 
future changes in the world provided we manage to predict the motion of all masspoints 

Democritus theory of change was of tremendous importance for the development of physical science It was partly 
accepted by Plato who retained much of atomism explaining change however not only by unchanging yet moving 
atoms but also by other Forms which were subject neither to change nor to motion But it was condemned by 
Aristotle who taught in its stead  that all change was the unfolding of the inherent potentialities of essentially 
unchanging substances Aristotles theory of substances as the subjects of change became dominant but it proved 
barren  and Democritus metaphysical theory that all change must be explained by movement became the tacitly 
accepted programme of work in physics down to our own day It is still part of the philosophy of physics in spite of 
the fact that physics itself has outgrown it to say nothing of the biological and social sciences For with Newton in 
addition to moving masspoints forces of changing 

 

 The inference from the existence of motion to that of a void is not valid because Parmenides inference from the 
fullness of the world to the impossibility of motion is not valid Plato seems to have been the first to see if only 
dimly that in a full world circular or vortexlike motion is possible provided that there is a liquidlike medium in the 
world Tea leaves can move with the vortex of tea in the cup This idea first offered somewhat halfheartedly in 
the Timaeus where space is filled e becomes the basis of Cartesianism and of the theory of the 
luminiferous ether as it was held down to  See also note  below 

 Democritus theory also admitted large blockatoms but the vast majority of his atoms were invisibly small 
 Cp The Poverty of Historicism section  
 Inspired by Plato Timaeus  where the potentialities of the elements are explained by the geometrical 
properties and thus the substantial forms of the corresponding solids 
 The barrenness of the essentialist cf note  above theory of substance is connected with its 
anthropomorphism for substances as Locke saw take their plausibility from the experience of a selfidentical but 
changing and unfolding self But although we may welcome the fact that Aristotles substance has disappeared 
from physics there is nothing wrong as Professor Hayek says in thinking anthropomorphically about man and 
there is no philosophical or a priori reason why it should disappear from psychology 

 

 

intensity and direction enter the scene True the changes of the Newtonian forces can be explained as due to or 
dependent upon motion that is upon the changing position of particles But they are nevertheless not identical with 
changes in the position of particles owing to the inverse square law the dependence is not even a linear one And 
with Faraday and Maxwell changing fields of forces become as important as material atomic particles That our 
modern atoms turn out to be composite is a minor matter from Democritus point of view not our atoms but rather our 
elementary particles would be the real atomsexcept that these too turn out to be liable to change Thus we have a 
most interesting situation A philosophy of change designed to meet the difficulty of understanding change rationally 
serves science for thousands of years but is ultimately superseded by the development of science itself and this fact 
passes practically unnoticed by philosophers who are busily denying the existence of philosophical problems 

Democritus theory was a marvellous achievement It provided a theoretical framework for the explanation of most of 
the empirically known properties of matter discussed already by the Ionians such as compressibility degrees of 
hardness and resilience rarefaction and condensation coherence disintegration combustion and many others But 
the theory was important not only as an explanation of the phenomena of experience First it established the 
methodological principle that a deductive theory or explanation must save the phenomena that is must be in 
agreement with experience Secondly it showed that a theory may be speculative and based upon the fundamental 
Parmenidean principle that the world as it must be understood by argumentative thought turns out to be different 
from the world of prima facie experience from the world as seen heard smelled tasted touched  and that such 
a speculative theory may nevertheless accept the empiricist criterion that it is the visible that decides the acceptance 
or rejection of a theory of the invisible  such as the atoms This philosophy has remained fundamental to the 
whole development of physics and has continued to conflict with all relativistic  and positivistic  tendencies 

Furthermore Democritus theory led to the first successes of the method of exhaustion the forerunner of the calculus 
of integration since Archimedes himself acknowledged that Democritus was the first to formulate the theory of the 
volumes of cones and pyramids  But perhaps the most fascinating

element in Democritus theory is his doctrine of the quantization of space and time I have in mind the doctrine now 
extensively discussed  that there is a shortest distance and a smallest time interval that is to say that 
there are distances in space and time elements of length and time Democritus amers  in contradistinction to 
his atoms such that no smaller ones are measurable 

VII 

Democritus atomism was developed and expounded as a point for point reply  to the detailed arguments of his 
Eleatic predecessors of Parmenides and his pupil Zeno Especially Democritus theory of atomic distances and time 
intervals is the direct result of Zenos arguments or more precisely of the rejection of Zenos conclusions But 
nowhere in what we know of Zeno is there an allusion to the discovery of irrationals which is of decisive 
importance for our story 

We do not know the date of the proof of the irrationality of the square root of two or the date when the discovery 
became publicly known Although there existed a tradition ascribing it to Pythagoras  sixth century BC and 
although some authors  call it the theorem of Pythagoras there can be little doubt that the discovery was not 
made and certainly not publicly known before  BC and probably not before  Whether Democritus knew 
about it is uncertain I now feel inclined to believe that he did not and that the title of Democritus two lost books

 Cf A March Natur und Erkenntnis Vienna  p  f 

 Cf S Luria op cit especially pp  ff  ff Miss A T Nicols in Indivisible Lines  Class Quarterly 
xxx   f argues that two passages one from Plutarch the other from Simplicius show why Democritus 
could not believe in indivisible lines she does not however discuss Lurias opposing views of  which I find 
much more convincing especially if we remember that Democritus tried to answer Zeno see next note But 
whatever Democritus views on indivisible or atomic distances Plato appears to have thought that Democritus 
atomism needed revision in the light of the discovery of the irrationals Heath however  Greek Mathematics 
  p  referring to Simplicius and Aristotle also believes that Democritus did not teach the existence of 
indivisible lines 
 This point for point reply is preserved in Aristotle On Generation and Corruption a  ff a very 
important passage first identified as Democritean by I Hammer Jensen in  and carefully discussed by Luria 
who says op cit   of Parmenides and Zeno  Democritus borrows their deductive arguments but he 
arrives at the opposite conclusion

NS  pp  the best discussion of the subject known to me 
 Rather than On Irrational Lines and Atoms as I translated it in note  to ch  of my Open Society 
revised edn What is probably meant by the title considering Platos passage mentioned in the next note 
might I think be best rendered by On Crazy Lines and Atoms Cf H Vogt Bibl Math    
against whom Heath argues op cit  f but not I think quite successfully and S Luria op cit pp  ff 
where it is convincingly suggested that Arist De insec lin  b  and Plutarch De comm notit   p 
 f contain traces of Democritus work According to these sources Democritus argument was this If lines 
are infinitely divisible then they are composed of an infinity of ultimate units and are therefore all related like 
 that is to say they are all noncomparable there is no proportion Indeed if lines are considered as 
classes of points the cardinal number potency of the points of a line is according to modern views equal for all 
lines whether the lines are finite or infinite This fact has been described as paradoxical for example by 
Bolzano and might well have been described as crazy by Democritus It may be noted that according to Brouwer 
even the classical theory of the Lebesgue measure of a continuum leads to fundamentally the same results for 
Brouwer asserts that all classical continua have zero measure so that the absence of a ratio is here expressed by 
oo Democritus result and his theory of amers appears to be inescapable as long as geometry is based on 
the Pythagorean arithmetical method ie on the counting of dots 

 

 

and that these two books do not contain any reference to the discovery of irrationality  

My belief that Democritus was unaware of the problem of irrationals is based on the fact that there are no traces of a 
defence of his theory against the blow which it received from this discovery Yet the blow was as fatal to Atomism as 
it was to Pythagoreanism Both theories were based on the doctrine that all measurement is ultimately counting of 
natural units so that every measurement must be reducible to pure numbers The distance between any two atomic 
points must therefore consist of a certain number of atomic distances thus all distances must be commensurable 
But this turns out to be impossible even in the simple case of the distances between the corners of a square because 
of the incommensurability of its diagonal d with its side a 

The English term incommensurable is somewhat unfortunate What is meant is rather the nonexistence of a ratio 
of natural numbers for example in the case of the diagonal of the unit square what can be proved is that there 
do not exist two natural numbers n and m whose ratio n  m is equal to the diagonal of the unit square 
Incommensurability thus does not mean incomparability by geometrical methods or by measurement but 
incomparability by arithmetical methods of counting or by natural numbers including the characteristic 
Pythagorean method of comparing ratios of natural numbers and including of course the counting of units of length 
or of measures 

Let us look back for a moment at the characteristics of this method of natural numbers and their ratios 
Pythagoras emphasis upon Number was fruitful from the point of view of the development of scientific ideas This is 
often but somewhat loosely expressed by saying that the Pythagoreans initiated numerical scientific measurement 
Now what I want to emphasize is that for the Pythagoreans all this was counting rather than measuring It was 
the counting of numbers of invisible essences or Natures which were Numbers of little dots Admittedly we cannot 
count these little dots directly since they are invisible What we actually do is not to count the Numbers or Natural 
Units but to measure ie to count arbitrary visible units But the significance of measurements was interpreted as 
revealing indirectly the true Ratios of the Natural Units or of the Natural Numbers 

 
 This would be in keeping with the fact mentioned in the note cited from the Open Society that the term 
alogos was it seems only much later used for irrational and that Plato who alludes  Republicd to 
Democritus title uses alogos there in the sense of crazy he never uses it as a synonym for arrhtos as far 
as I know 

 

 

Thus Euclids methods of proving the socalled Theorem of Pythagoras  Euclid  according to which if a is the 
side of a triangle opposite to its right angle between b and c 

 

was foreign to the spirit of Pythagorean mathematics It seems now accepted that the theorem was known to the 
Babylonians and geometrically proved by them Yet neither Pythagoras nor Plato appear to have known Euclids 
geometrical proof which uses different triangles with common base and height for the problem for which they 
offered solutions the arithmetical one of finding the integral solutions for the sides of rectangular triangles can if 
 is known be easily solved by the formula m and n are natural numbers and m  n 

But formula  was apparently unknown to Pythagoras and even to Plato This emerges from the tradition  
according to which Pythagoras proposed the formula obtained from  by putting m  n   

 

 

which can be read off the gnmn of the square numbers but which is less general than  since it fails for 
example for    To Plato who is reported  to have improved Pythagoras formula  is attributed another 
formula which still falls short of the general solution  

In order to show the difference between the Pythagorean or arithmetical method and the geometrical method Platos 
proof that the square over the diagonal of the unit square that is the square with the side  and an area of measure 
 has an area of twice the unit square that is an area of measure  may be mentioned It consists in drawing a 
square with the diagonal 

and then showing that we may extend the drawing thus 

 

 

from which we obtain the result by counting But the transition from the first to the second of these figures cannot 
possibly be shown to be valid by the arithmetic of dots and not even by the methods of ratios 

That this is indeed impossible is established by the famous proof of the 

 
 Procli Diadochi in primum Euclidis Elementorum librum commentarii ed G Friedlein 

Leipzig  p   

 By Proclus op cit pp    

 

 

irrationality of the diagnonal that is of the square root of  assumed as wellknown by Plato and Aristotle It consists 
in showing that the assumption    nm that is that  is equal to a ratio of any two natural numbers n and m 
leads to an absurdity 

We first note that we can assume that  not more than one of the two numbers n and m is even 

For if both were even then we could always cancel out the factor  so as to obtain two other natural numbers n and 
m such that n  m  nm and such that at most one of the two numbers n and m would be even Now by 
squaring  we get    nm and from this  m  n and thus  n is even Thus there must exist a natural 
number a so that  n  a and we get from  and   m  n  a and thus  m  a But this means  
m is even 

It is clear that  and  contradict  Thus the assumption that there are two natural numbers n and m whose 
ratio equals  leads to an absurd conclusion Therefore  is not a ratio it is irrational 

This proof uses only the arithmetic of natural numbers It therefore uses purely Pythagorean methods and the 
tradition that it was discovered within the Pythagorean school need not be questioned But it is improbable that the 
discovery was made by Pythagoras or that it was made very early Zeno does not seem to know it nor does 
Democritus Moreover as it destroys the basis of Pythagoreanism it is reasonable to assume that it was not made 
long before the order reached the height of its influence at least not before it was well established for it seems to 
have contributed to its decline The tradition that it was made within the order but kept secret seems to me very 
plausible It may be supported by considering that the old term for irrationalarrhtos unutterable or 

unmentionablemay well have hinted at an unmentionable secret Tradition has it that the member of the school 
who gave 

 

away the secret was killed for his treachery  However this may be there is little doubt that the realization that 
irrational magnitudes they were of course not recognized as numbers existed and that their existence could be 
proved undermined the faith of the Pythagorean order and destroyed the hope of deriving cosmology or even 
geometry from the arithmetic of natural numbers 
VIII 
It was Plato who realized this fact and who in the Laws stressed its importance in the strongest possible terms 
denouncing his compatriots for their failure to gauge its implications I believe that his whole philosophy and 
especially his theory of Forms or Ideas was influenced by it Plato was very close to the Pythagorean as well as to 
the Eleatic School and although he appears to have felt antipathetic to Democritus he was himself a kind of atomist 
Atomist teaching remained as one of the school traditions of the Academy   This is not surprising in view of the 
close relation between Pythagorean and atomistic ideas But all this was threatened by the discovery of the 
irrationals I suggest that Platos main contribution to science sprang from his realization of the problem of the 
irrational and from the modification of Pythagoreanism and atomism which he undertook in order to rescue science 
from a catastrophic situationHe realized that the purely arithmetical theory of nature was defeated and that a new 
mathematical method for the description and explanation of the world was needed Thus he encouraged the 
development of an autonomous geometrical method It found its fulfilment in the Elements of the Platonist Euclid
What are the facts I shall try briefly to put them all together 
 

Pythagoreanism and atomism in Democritus form were both fundamentally based on arithmetic that is to say 
on counting 
Plato emphasized the catastrophic character of the discovery of the irrationals 
He inscribed over the gates of the Academy Nobody Untrained in Geometry May Enter My House But 
geometry according to Platos immediate pupil Aristotle  as well as Euclid typically treats of 
incommensurables or irrationals in contradistinction to arithmetic which treats of the odd and the even ie 
of integers and their relations 

 
 

  Within a short time after Platos death his school produced in Euclid Elements a work one of whose main 

points was that it freed mathematics from the arithmetical assumption of commensurability or rationality 
Plato himself contributed to this development and especially to the development of solid geometry 

 
 
 The story is told of one Hippasus a somewhat shadowy figure he is said to have died at sea cf Diels  See 

also A Wassersteins article mentioned in note  above 

 See S Luria especially on Plutarch loc cit 
 An Post b Metaph a b See also Epinomis d 

 

 

 

 

  More especially he gave in the Timaeus a specifically geometrical version of the formerly purely arithmetical 

atomic theory a version which constructed the elementary particles the famous Platonic bodies out of 
triangles which incorporated the irrational square roots of two and of three See below In nearly all other 
respects he preserved Pythagorean ideas as well as some of the most important ideas of Democritus  At the 
same time he tried to eliminate Democritus void for he realized  that motion remains possible even in a full 
world provided motion is conceived as of the character of vortices in a liquid Thus he retained some of the 
most fundamental ideas of Parmenides  
Plato encouraged the construction of geometrical models of the world and especially models explaining the 
planetary movements And I believe that Euclids geometry was not intended as an exercise in pure geometry 
as is now usually assumed but as an organon of a theory of the world According to this view the 
Elements is not a textbook of geometry but an attempt to solve systematically the main problems of Platos 
cosmology This was done with such success that the problems having been solved disappeared and were 
almost forgotten though a trace remains in Proclus who writes Some have thought that the subject matter of 
the various books of Euclid  pertains to the cosmos and that they are intended to help us in our contemplation 
of and theorizing about the universe op cit note  above Prologus II p   Yet even Proclus does 
not mention in this context the main problemthat of the irrationals although he mentions it of course 
elsewhere though he points out rightly that the Elements culminate with the construction of the cosmic or 
Platonic regular polyhedra Ever since  Plato 

 
 Plato took over more especially Democritus theory of vortices  Diels fragm   cf Anaxagoras Diels  
and   see also the next two footnotes and his theory of what we nowadays would call gravitational 
phenomena  Diels  Anaxagoras    and a theory which slightly modified by Aristotle was 
ultimately discarded by Galileo 
 The clearest passage is Timaeus c where it is said that neither in the case of rubbed amber nor of the 
Heraclean stone magnet is there any real attraction there is no void and these things push themselves around 
one upon another On the other hand Plato was not too clear on this point since his elementary particles other 
than the cube and the pyramid cannot be packed without leaving some empty space between them as 
Aristotle observed in De Caelo b See also note  above and Timaeuse 
 Platos reconciliation of atomism and the theory of the plenum nature abhors the void became of the greatest 
importance for the history of physics down to our own day For it strongly influenced Descartes became the basis 
of the theory of ether and light and thus ultimately via Huyghens and Maxwell of de Broglies and of 
Schroedingers wave mechanics See my report in Atti d Congr Intern di Filosofia     pp 
 ff 
 The only exception is the partial reappearance of arithmetical methods in the New Quantum Theory eg in the 
electron shell theory of the periodic system based upon Paulis exclusion principle 

Concerning the modern tendency towards what is sometimes called arithmetization of geometry a tendency 
which is by no means characteristic of all modern work on geometry or of analysis it should be noted that it 
shows little similarity to the Pythagorean approach since sets or infinite sequences of natural numbers are 
its main instruments rather than the natural numbers themselves 

Only those who confine themselves to constructive or finitist or intuitionist methods of number theoryas 
opposed to set theoretic methodsmight claim that their attempts to reduce geometry to number theory resemble 
Pythagorean or prePlatonic ideas of arithmetization A great step in this direction has been achieved quite 
recently it seems by the German mathematician E de Wette 

 

 

and Euclid but not before geometry rather than arithmetic appears as the fundamental instrument of all 
physical explanations and descriptions in the theory of matter as well as in cosmology  

These are the historical facts They go a long way I believe towards establishing my contention that what I have 
described as the prima facie method of teaching philosophy cannot lead to an understanding of the problems 
which inspired Plato Nor can it lead to an appreciation of what may be justly claimed to be his greatest philosophical 
achievement the geometrical theory of the world The great physicists of the RenaissanceCopernicus Galileo 
Kepler Gilbertwho turned from Aristotle to Plato intended by this move to replace the Aristotelian qualitative 
substances or potentialities by a geometrical method of cosmology Indeed that is what the Renaissance in science 
largely meant a renaissance of the geometrical method which was the basis of the works of Euclid Aristarchus 
Archimedes Copernicus Kepler Galileo Descartes Newton Maxwell and Einstein 

But is this achievement properly described as philosophical Does it not rather belong to physicsa factual science 
and to pure mathematicsa branch as Wittgensteins school would contend of tautological logic 

I believe that we can at this stage see fairly clearly why Platos achievement although it has no doubt its physical its 
logical its mixed and its nonsensical components was a philosophical achievement why at least part of his 
philosophy of nature and of physics has lasted and I believe will last 

What we find in Plato and his predecessors is the conscious construction and invention of a new approach towards 
the world and towards knowledge of the world This approach transforms an originally theological idea the idea of 
explaining the visible worls by a postulated invisible world  into the fundamental instrument of 
theoretical science The idea was explicitly formulated by Anaxagoras and Democritus  as the principle of 
investigation into the nature of matter or body visible matter was to be explained by hypotheses about invisibles 
about an invisible structure which is too small to be seen With Plato this idea is consciously accepted and 
generalized the visible world of change is ultimately to be explained by an invisible world of unchanging Forms or 
substances or essences or natures that is as I shall try to show in more detail geometrical shapes or figures 

Is this idea about the invisible structure of matter a physical or a philosophical idea If a physicist merely acts upon 
this theory if he accepts it 

 
 For a similar view of Platos and Euclids influence see G F Hemens Proc of the Xth Intern Congress 
of Philosophy  Amsterdam  Fasc   
 Cf Homers explanation of the visible world around Troy with the help of the invisible world of the Olympus The 
idea loses with Democritus some of its theological character which is still strong in Parmenides although less 
so in Anaxagoras but regains it with Plato only to lose it again soon afterwards 

 See the references given above and Anaxagoras Fragments B and  DielsKranz 

 

perhaps unconsciously by accepting the traditional problems of his subject as furnished by the problemsituation with 
which he is confronted and if he so acting produces a new specific theory of the structure of matter then I should 
not call him a philosopher But if he reflects upon it and for example rejects it like Berkeley or Mach preferring a 
phenomenological or positivistic physics to the theoretical and somewhat theological approach then he may be 
called a philosopher Similarly those who consciously sought the theoretical approach who constructed it and who 
explicitly formulated it and thus transferred the hypothetical and deductive method from theology to physics were 
philosophers even though they were physicists in so far as they acted upon their own precepts and tried to produce 
actual theories of the invisible structure of matter 

But I shall not pursue the question of the proper application of the label philosophy any further for this problem 
which is Wittgensteins problem clearly turns out to be one of linguistic usage it is indeed a pseudoproblem and 
one which by now must be rapidly degenerating into a bore to my audience Yet I wish to add a few words on Platos 
theory of Forms or Ideas or to be more precise on point  in the list of historical facts given above 

Platos theory of the structure of matter can be found in the Timaeus It has at least a superficial similarity to the 
modern theory of solids which interprets them as crystals His physical bodies are composed of invisible elementary 
particles of various shapes the shapes being responsible for the macroscopic properties of visible matter The 
shapes of the elementary particles are determined in their turn by the shapes of the plane figures which form their 
sides And these plane figures in their turn are ultimately all composed of two elementary triangles the halfsquare 
or isosceles rectangular triangle which incorporates the square root of two and the halfequilateral 
rectangular triangle which incorporates the square root of three both of them irrationals 

These triangles in their turn are described as the copies  of unchanging Forms or Ideas which means that 
specifically geometrical Forms are admitted into the heaven of the Pythagorean arithmetical FormNumbers 

There is little doubt that the motive of this construction is the attempt to solve the crisis of atomism by incorporating 
irrationals into the last elements of which the world is built Once this has been done the difficulty arising from the 
existence of irrational distances is overcome 

But why did Plato choose just these two triangles I have elsewhere  expressed the view as a conjecture that 
Plato believed that all other irrationals might be obtained by adding to the rationals multiples of the square 

 
 For the process by which the triangles are stamped out of space the mother by the ideas the fathers cf my 
Open Society note  to ch  and the references there given as well as note  to ch  In admitting irrational 
triangles into his heaven of divine Forms Plato admits something indeterminable in the sense of the 
Pythagoreans ie something belonging to the Bad side of the Table of Opposites That bad things may have to 
be admitted seems to be first stated in Plato Parmenides be the admission is put into the mouth of 
Parmenides himself 

 In the last quoted note of my Open Society 

 

 

 

roots of two and three  I now feel more confident that the crucial passage in the Timaeus does imply this doctrine 
which was mistaken as Euclid later showed For in the passage in question Plato says quite clearly All triangles 
are derived from two each having a right angle going on to specify these two as the halfsquare and halfequilateral 
But in the context this can only mean that all triangles can be composed by combining these two a view which is 
equivalent to the mistaken theory of the relative commensurability of all irrationals with sums of rationals and the 
square roots of two and three  

But Plato did not pretend that he had a proof of the theory in question On the contrary he says that he assumes the 
two triangles as principles in accordance with an account which combines likely conjecture with necessity And a 
little later after explaining that he takes the halfequilateral triangle as the second of his principles he says The 
reason is too long a story but if anybody should probe into this matter and prove that it has this property I suppose 
the property that all other triangles can be composed of these two then the prize is his with all our good will  The 
language is somewhat obscure and the likely reason is that Plato was conscious that he lacked a proof of his 
mistaken conjecture concerning these two triangles and felt it should be supplied by somebody 

The obscurity of the passage had it appears the strange effect that Platos quite clearly stated choice of triangles 
which introduce irrationals into his world of Forms escaped the notice of most of his readers and commentators in 
spite of Platos emphasis upon the problem of irrationality in other places And this in turn may perhaps explain why 
Platos Theory of Forms could appear to Aristotle to be fundamentally the same as the Pythagorean theory of form
numbers  and why Platos atomism appeared to Aristotle merely 

 
 This would mean that all geometrical distances magnitudes are commensurable with one of three 
measures or a sum of two or all of them related at     It seems likely that Aristotle even believed that all 
geometrical magnitudes are commensurable with one of two measures viz  and  For he writes 
 Metaphysics a The diagonal and the side of a square and all geometrical magnitudes are 
measured by two measures Cp Ross note on this passage 
 In note  to ch  of my Open Society mentioned above I also conjectured that it was the close approximation 
of the sum of these two square roots to  which encouraged Plato in his mistaken theory 

 The two quotations are from the Timaeus cd and ab 
 I believe that our consideration may throw some light on the problem of Platos famous two principlesThe One 
and The Indeterminate Dyad The following interpretation develops a suggestion made by van der Wielen  De 
Ideegetallen van Plato  p  f and brilliantly defended against van der Wielens own criticism by 
Ross  Platos Theory of Ideas p  We assume that the Indeterminate Dyad is a straight line or 
distance not to be interpreted as a unit distance or as having yet been measured at all We assume that a point 
limit monas One is placed successively in such positions that it divides the Dyad according to the ratio   n 
for any natural number n Then we can describe the generation of the numbers as follows For n   the Dyad is 
divided into two parts whose ratio is    This may be interpreted as the generation of Twoness out of Oneness 
     and the Dyad since we have divided the Dyad into two equal parts Having thus generated the 
number  we can divide the Dyad according to the ratio    and the larger of the ensuing sections as before 
according to the ratio    thus generating three equal parts and the number  generally the generation of a 
number n gives rise to a division of the Dyad in the ratio   n and with this to the generation of the number n  
 And in each stage the One intervenes afresh as the point which introduces a limit or form or measure into the 
otherwise indeterminate Dyad to create the new number this remark is intended to strengthen Ross case 
against van der Wielens 

Now it should be noted that this procedure although it generates in the first instance at least only the series of 
natural numbers nevertheless contains a geometrical elementthe division of a line first into two equal parts 
and then into two parts according to a certain proportion   n Both kinds of division are in need of geometrical 
methods and the second more especially needs a method such as Eudoxus Theory of Proportions Now I 
suggest that Plato began to ask himself why he should not divide the Dyad also in the proportion of    and of 
   This he must have felt was a departure from the method by which the natural numbers are generated it 
is less arithmetical still and it needs more specifically geometrical methods But it would generate in the place 
of natural numbers linear elements in the proportion    and    which may be identical with the atomic 
lines  Metaphysics a from which the atomic triangles are constructed At the same time the 
characterization of the Dyad as indeterminate would become highly appropriate in view of the Pythagorean 
attitude cf Philolaos Diels fragm  and  towards the irrational Perhaps the name The Great and the Small 
began to be replaced by The Indeterminate Dyad when irrational proportions were generated in addition to 
rational ones 

Assuming this view to be correct we might conjecture that Plato slowly approached beginning in the Hippias 
Major and thus long before the Republicas opposed to a remark made by Ross op cit top of page  the 
view that the irrationals are numbers a since they are comparable with some numbers at least and b 
since both the natural numbers and the irrationals are generated by similar and essentially geometric processes 
But once this view is reached and it was first reached it appears in the Epinomis de whether or not this 
work is as I am inclined to believe Platos then even the irrational triangles of the Timaeus become 
numbers ie characterized by numerical if irrational proportions But at this point the peculiar contribution of 
Plato and the difference between his and the Pythagorean theory is liable to become indiscernible and this may 
explain why it has been lost sight of in part even by Aristotle 

 

 

as a comparatively minor variation on that of Democritus  Aristotle in spite of taking for granted both the 
association of arithmetic with the odd and even and of geometry with the irrational does not appear to have taken 
the problem of the irrationals seriously Proceeding as he did from an interpretation of the Timaeus which identified 
Platos Space with matter he seems to have taken Platos reform programme for geometry for granted it had been 
partly carried out by Eudoxus before Aristotle entered the Academy and Aristotle was only superficially interested in 
mathematics He never alludes to the inscription over the Academy gates 

To sum up it seems probable that Platos theory of Forms and also his theory of matter were both restatements of 
the theories of his predecessors the Pythagoreans and Democritus respectively in the light of his realization that the 
irrationals demanded that geometry should come before arithmetic By encouraging this emancipation Plato 
contributed to the development of Euclids system the most important and influential deductive theory ever 
constructed By his adoption of geometry as the theory of the world he provided Aristarchus Newton and Einstein 
with their intellectual toolbox The calamity of Greek atomism was thus transformed into a momentous achievement 
But Platos scientific interests are partly forgotten The problemsituation in science which gave rise to his 
philosophical problems is little understood And his greatest achievement the geometrical theory of the 

 

 That this was Aristotles view has been pointed out by Luria op cit 

 

 

world has influenced our worldpicture to such an extent that we unreflectingly take it for granted 

IX 

One example never suffices As my second example out of a great many interesting possibilities I choose Kant His 
Critique of Pure Reason is one of the most difficult books ever written Kant wrote in great haste  and about a 
problem which I shall try to show was not only insoluble but also misconceived Nevertheless it was not a pseudo
problem but an inescapable problem which arose out of the contemporary situation of physical theory 

His book was written for people who knew something about Newtons stellar dynamics and who had at least some 
idea of his forerunnersof Copernicus Tycho Brahe Kepler and Galileo 

It is perhaps hard for intellectuals of our own day spoilt and blas as we are by the spectacle of scientific success to 
realize what Newtons theory meant not just for Kant but for any eighteenthcentury thinker After the unmatched 
daring with which the Ancients had tackled the riddle of the Universe there had come long periods of decay and 
recovery and then a staggering success Newton had discovered the long sought secret His geometrical theory 
based on and modelled after Euclid had been received at first with great misgivings even by its own originator  
The reason was that the gravitational force of attraction was felt to be occult or at least something which needed an 
explanation But although no plausible explanation was found and Newton scorned recourse to ad hoc hypotheses 
all misgivings had disappeared long before Kant made his own important contribution to Newtonian theory  years 
after the Principia  No qualified judge  of the situation could doubt any longer that Newtons theory was true It 
had been tested by the most precise measurements and it had always been right It had led to the prediction of 
minute deviations from Keplers laws and to new discoveries In a time like ours when theories come and go like the 
buses in Piccadilly and when every schoolboy has heard that Newton has long been superseded by Einstein it is 
hard to recapture the sense of conviction which Newtons theory inspired or the sense of elation and of liberation A 
unique event had happened in the history of thought one which could never be repeated the first and final 
discovery of the absolute truth about the universe An ageold dream had come true Mankind had obtained 
knowledge real certain indubitable and demonstrable knowledgedivine scientia or epistm and not merely 
doxa human opinion 

 
 He was afraid of dying before completing his work 
 See Newtons letters to Bentley  Cf note  to ch  below 
 The socalled KantLaplacean Hypothesis published by Kant in  
 There had been some very pertinent criticism especially by Leibniz and Berkeley but in view of the success of 
the theory it wasI believe rightlyfelt that the critics had somehow missed the point of the theory We must not 
forget that even today the theory still stands with only minor modifications as an excellent first approximation or 
in view of Kepler perhaps as a second approximation 

 

 

Thus for Kant Newtons theory was simply true and the belief in its truth remained unshaken for a century after Kants 
death Kant to the end accepted what he and everybody else took for a fact the attainment of scientia or 
epistm At first he accepted it without question This state he called his dogmatic slumber He was roused from it 
by Hume 

Hume had taught that there could be no such thing as certain knowledge of universal laws or epistm that all we 
knew was obtained with the help of observation which could be only of singular or particular instances so that all 
theoretical knowledge was uncertain His arguments were convincing and he was of course right Yet there was a 
fact or what appeared as a factNewtons attainment of epistm 

Hume roused Kant to the realization of the near absurdity of what he never doubted to be a fact Here was a problem 
which could not be dismissed How could a man have got hold of such knowledge Knowledge which was general 
precise mathematical demonstrable and indubitable like Euclidean geometry and yet capable of giving a causal 
explanation of observed facts 

Thus arose the central problem of the Critique How is pure natural science possible By pure natural science
scientia epistmKant simply meant Newtons theory This he does not say unfortunately and I do not see 
how a student reading the first Critique  and  could possibly find out But that Kant has Newtons theory 
in mind is clear from the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science  where he gives an a priori 
deduction of Newtons theory see especially the eight theorems of the Second Main Part with its Additions 
especially Addition  Note  paragraph  Kant relates Newtons theory in the fifth paragraph of the final General 
Note on Phenomenology to the starry heavens It is also clear from the Conclusion of the Critique of Practical 
Reason  where the appeal to the starry heavens is explained at the end of the second paragraph by the a 
priori character of the new astronomy   

Although the Critique is badly written and although bad grammar abounds in it this problem was not a linguistic 
puzzle Here was knowledge How could Newtonever attain it The question was inescapable  But it 
was also insoluble For the apparent fact of the attainment of epistm was no fact As we now know or believe we 
know Newtons theory is no more than a marvellous conjecture an astonishingly good approximation unique 
indeed but not as divine truth only as a unique invention of a human genius not epistm but belonging to the 
realm of doxa With this Kants problem How is pure natural science possible collapses and the most disturbing of 
his perplexities disappears 

Kants proposed solution of his insoluble problem consisted of what he proudly called his Copernican Revolution of 
the problem of knowledge 

 
 In these lines Kant says of Newtons achievement that it is an insight into the structure of the universe never to be 
changed in all time and one which can look forward to its growth through the accumulation of observations but 
need never fear a setback 

 It still troubled Poincar in  

 

Knowledgeepistmwas possible because we are not passive receptors of sense data but their active 
digestors By digesting and assimilating them we form and organize them into a Cosmos the Universe of Nature In 
this process we impose upon the material presented to our senses the mathematical laws which are part of our 
digestive and organizing mechanism Thus our intellect does not discover universal laws in nature but it prescribes 
its own laws and imposes them upon nature 

This theory is a strange mixture of absurdity and truth It is as absurd as the mistaken problem it attempts to solve for 
it proves too much being designed to prove too much According to Kants theory pure natural science is not only 
possible although he does not always realize this it becomes contrary to his intention the necessary result of 
our mental outfit For if the fact of our attainment of epistm can be explained at all by the fact that our intellect 
legislates for and imposes its own laws upon nature then the first of these two facts cannot be contingent any more 
than the second  Thus the problem is no longer how Newton could make his discovery but how everybody else 
could have failed to make it How is it that our digestive mechanism did not work much earlier 

This is a patently absurd consequence of Kants idea But to dismiss it offhand and to dismiss his problem as a 
pseudoproblem is not good enough For we can find an element of truth in his idea and a much needed correction 
of some Humean views after reducing his problem to its proper dimensions His question we now know or believe 
we know should have been How are successful conjectures possible And our answer in the spirit of his 
Copernican Revolution might I suggest be something like this Because as you said we are not passive receptors 
of sense data but active organisms Because we react to our environment not always merely instinctively but 
sometimes consciously and freely Because we can invent myths stories theories because we have a thirst for 
explanation an insatiable curiosity a wish to know Because we not only invent stories and theories but try them out 
and see whether they work and how they work Because by a great effort by trying hard and making many mistakes 
we may sometimes if we are lucky succeed in hitting upon a story an explanation which saves the phenomena 
perhaps by making up a myth about invisibles such as atoms or gravitational forces which explain the visible 
Because knowledge is an adventure of ideas These ideas it is true are produced by us and not by the world around 
us they are not merely the traces of repeated sensations or stimuli or what not here you were right But we are more 
active and free than even you believed for similar observations or similar environmental situations do not as your 
theory implied produce similar explanations in different men Nor is the fact that we create our theories and that we 
attempt to impose them upon the 

 
 A crucial requirement which any adequate theory of knowledge must satisfy is that it must not explain too much 
Any nonhistorical theory explaining why a certain discovery had to be made must fail because it could not 
possibly explain why it was not made somewhat earlier 

 

 

 

world an explanation of their success  as you believed For the overwhelming majority of our theories of our freely 
invented ideas are unsuccessful they do not stand up to searching tests and are discarded as falsified by 
experience Only a very few of them succeed for a time in the competitive struggle for survival  

X 

Few of Kants successors appear ever to have understood clearly the precise problemsituation which gave rise to his 
work There were two such problems for him Newtons dynamics of the heavens and the absolute standards of 
human brotherhood and justice to which the French revolutionaries appealed or as Kant puts it the starry heavens 
above me and the moral law within me But Kants starry heavens are seldom recognized for what they were an 
allusion to Newton  From Fichte onward  many have copied Kants method and the difficult style of parts of his 
Critique But most of these imitators unaware of Kants original interests and problems busily tried either to tighten 
or else to explain away the Gordian knot in which Kant through no fault of his own had tied himself up 

We must beware of mistaking the wellnigh senseless and pointless subtleties of the imitators for the pressing and 
genuine problems of the pioneer We should remember that his problem although not an empirical one in the 
ordinary sense nevertheless turned out unexpectedly to be in some sense factual  Kant called such facts 
transcendental since it arose from an apparent but nonexistent instance of scientia or epistm And we 
should I submit seriously consider the suggestion that Kants answer in spite of its partial absurdity contained the 
nucleus of a true philosophy of science 

 
 Applying note  no theory can explain why our search for explanatory theories is successful Successful 
explanation must retain on any valid theory the probability zero assuming that we measure this probability 
approximately by the ratio of the successful explanatory hypotheses to all hypotheses which might be designed 
by man

THREE VIEWS CONCERNING HUMAN KNOWLEDGE 
 THE SCIENCE OF GALILEO AND ITS NEW BETRAYAL 

ONCE upon a time there was a famous scientist whose name was Galileo Galilei He was tried by the Inquisition and 
forced to recant his teaching This caused a great stir and for well over two hundred and fifty years the case 
continued to arouse indignation and excitementlong after public opinion had won its victory and the Church had 
become tolerant of science 

But this is by now a very old story and I fear it has lost its interest For Galilean science has no enemies left it 

seems its life hereafter is secure The victory won long ago was final and all is quiet on this front So we take a 
detached view of the affair nowadays having learned at last to think historically and to understand both sides of a 
dispute And nobody cares to listen to the bore who cant forget an old grievance 

What after all was this old case about It was about the status of the Copernican System of the World which 
besides other things explained the diurnal motion of the sun as only apparent and as due to the rotation of our own 
earth  The Church was very ready to admit that the new system was simpler than the old one that it was a more 
convenient instrument for astronomical calculations and for predictions And Pope Gregorys reform of the 
calendar made full practical use of it There was no objection to Galileos teaching the mathematical theory so long 
as he made it clear that its value was instrumental only that it was nothing but a supposition as Cardinal 

 

 I emphasize here the diurnal as opposed to the annual motion of the sun because it was the theory of the diurnal 
motion which clashed with Joshua f and because the explanation of the diurnal motion of the sun by the 
motion of the earth will be one of my main examples in what follows This explanation is of course much older 
than Copernicusolder even than Aristarchusand it has been repeatedly rediscovered for example by Oresme 

 

 

Bellarmino put it  or a mathematical hypothesisa kind of mathematical trick invented and assumed in order to 
abbreviate and ease the calculations  In other words there were no objections so long as Galileo was ready to fall 
into line with Andreas Osiander who had said in his preface to Copernicus De revolutionibus There is no need 
for these hypotheses to be true or even to be at all like the truth rather one thing is sufficient for themthat they 
should yield calculations which agree with the observations 

Galileo himself of course was very ready to stress the superiority of the Copernican system as an instrument of 
calculation But at the same time he conjectured and even believed that it was a true description of the 
world and for him as for the Church this was by far the most important aspect of the matter He had indeed some 
good reasons for believing in the truth of the theory He had seen in his telescope that Jupiter and his moons formed 
a miniature model of the Copernican solar system according to which the planets were moons of the sun Moreover 
if Copernicus was right the inner planets and they alone should when observed from the earth show phases like 
the moon and Galileo had seen in his telescope the phases of Venus 

The Church was unwilling to contemplate the truth of a New System of the World which seemed to contradict a 
passage in the Old Testament But this was hardly its main reason A deeper reason was clearly stated by Bishop 
Berkeley about a hundred years later in his criticism of Newton 

In Berkeleys time the Copernican System of the World had developed into Newtons Theory of gravity and Berkeley 
saw in it a serious competitor to religion He was convinced that a decline of religious faith and religious authority 
would result from the new science if its interpretation by the freethinkers was correct for they saw in its success a 
proof of the power of the human intellect unaided by divine revelation to uncover the secrets of our 
worldthe reality hidden behind its appearance 

This Berkeley felt was to misinterpret the new science He analysed Newtons theory with complete candour and 

great philosophical acumen and a critical survey of Newtons concepts convinced him that this theory could not 

 

    Galileo will act prudently wrote Cardinal Bellarmino who had been one of the inquisitors in the case against 
Giordano Bruno    if he will speak hypothetically ex suppositione   to say that we give a better account of 
the appearances by supposing the earth to be moving and the sun at rest than we could if we used eccentrics 
and epicycles is to speak properly there is no danger in that and it is all that the mathematician requires Cf H 
Grisar Galileistudien  Appendix ix Although this passage makes Bellarmino one of the 
founding fathers of the epistemology which Osiander had suggested some time before and 
which I am going to call instrumentalism Bellarminounlike Berkeleywas by no means a 
convinced instrumentalist himself as other passages in this letter show He merely saw in 
instrumentalism one of the possible ways dealing with inconvenient scientific hypotheses 
The same remarks might well be true of Osiander See also note  in section  below 
 The quotation is from Bacons criticism of Copernicus in the Novum Organum II  In the next quotation 
from De revolutionibus I have translated the term verisimilis by like the truth It should certainly not be 
translated here by probable for the whole point here is the question whether Copernicus system is or is not 
similar in structure to the world that is whether it is truthlike The questions of degree of certainty or probability

possibly be anything but a mathematical hypothesis that is a convenient instrument for the calculation and 
prediction of phenomena or appearances that it could not possibly be taken as a true description of anything real  

Berkeleys criticism was hardly noticed by the physicists but it was taken up by philosophers sceptical as well as 
religious As a weapon it turned out to be a boomerang In Humes hands it became a threat to all beliefto all 
knowledge whether human or revealed In the hands of Kant who firmly believed both in God and in the truth of 
Newtonian science it developed into the doctrine that theoretical knowledge of God is impossible and that 
Newtonian science must pay for the admission of its claim to truth by the renunciation of its claim to have discovered 
the real world behind the world of appearance it was a true science of nature but nature was precisely the world of 
mere phenomena the world as it appeared to our assimilating minds Later certain Pragmatists based their whole 
philosophy upon the view that the idea of pure knowledge was a mistake that there could be no knowledge in any 
other sense but in the sense of instrumental knowledge that knowledge was power and that truth was usefulness 

Physicists with a few brilliant exceptions   kept aloof from all these philosophical debates which remained 
completely inconclusive Faithful to the tradition created by Galileo they devoted themselves to the search for truth 
as he had understood it 

Or so they did until very recently For all this is now past history Today the view of physical science founded by 
Osiander Cardinal Bellarmino and Bishop Berkeley  has won the battle without another shot being fired Without 
any further debate over the philosophical issue without producing any

well accept Simplicius report that Eudoxus under Platos influence in order to account for 
the observable phenomena of planetary motion set himself the task of evolving an abstract 
geometrical system of rotating spheres to which he did not attribute any physical reality 
There seems to be some resemblance between this programme and that of the Epinomis 
 where the study of abstract geometryof the theory of the irrationals dbis 
described as a necessary preliminary to planetary theory in addition to that of numberie

new argument the instrumentalist view as I shall call it has become an accepted dogma It may well now be 
called the official view of physical theory since it is accepted by most of our leading theorists of physics although 
neither by Einstein nor by Schrdinger And it has become part of the current teaching of physics 

 THE ISSUE AT STAKE 

All this looks like a great victory of philosophical critical thought over the nave realism of the physicists But I doubt 
whether this interpretation is right 

Few if any of the physicists who have now accepted the instrumentalist view of Cardinal Bellarmino and Bishop 
Berkeley realize that they have accepted a philosophical theory Nor do they realize that they have broken with the 
Galilean tradition On the contrary most of them think that they have kept clear of philosophy and most of them no 
longer care anyway What they now care about as physicists is a mastery of the mathematical formalism i
e of the instrument and b its applications and they care for nothing else And they think that by thus excluding 
everything else they have finally got rid of all philosophical nonsense This very attitude of being tough and not 
standing any nonsense prevents them from considering seriously the philosophical arguments for and against the 

Galilean view of science though they will no doubt have heard of Mach   Thus the victory of the instrumentalist 
philosophy is hardly due to the soundness of its arguments 

How then did it come about As far as I can see through the coincidence of two factors a difficulties in the 
interpretation of the formalism of the Quantum Theory and b the spectacular practical success of its applications 

a In  Niels Bohr one of the greatest thinkers in the field of atomic physics introduced the socalled principle 
of complementarity into atomic physics which amounted to a renunciation of the attempt to interpret atomic 
theory as a description of anything Bohr pointed out that we could avoid certain contradictions which threatened to 
arise between the formalism and its various interpretations only by reminding ourselves that the formalism as such 
was selfconsistent and that each single case of its application or each kind of case remained consistent with it 
The contradictions only arose through the attempt to comprise within one interpretation the formalism together with 
more than one case or kind of case of its experimental application But as Bohr pointed out any two of these 
conflicting applications were physically incapable of ever being combined in one experiment Thus the result of 
every single experiment was consistent with the theory and unambiguously laid down by it This he said was all 
we could get The claim to get more and even the hope of ever getting more we must renounce 

 

 But they seem to have forgotten that Mach was led by his instrumentalism to fight against atomic theorya typical 
example of the obscurantism of instrumentalism which is the topic of section  below 

 

 

physics remains consistent only if we do not try to interpret or to understand its theories beyond a mastering the 
formalism and b relating them to each of their actually realizable cases of application separately  

Thus the instrumentalist philosophy was used here ad hoc in order to provide an escape for the theory from certain 
contradictions by which it was threatened It was used in a defensive moodto rescue the existing theory and the 
principle of complementarity has I believe for this reason remained completely sterile within physics In twenty
seven years it has produced nothing except some philosophical discussions and some arguments for the 
confounding of critics especially Einstein 

I do not believe that physicists would have accepted such an ad hoc principle had they understood that it was ad 
hoc or that it was a philosophical principlepart of Bellarminos and Berkeleys instrumentalist philosophy of physics 
But they remembered Bohrs earlier and extremely fruitful principle of correspondence and hoped in vain for similar 
results 

b Instead of results due to the principle of complementarity other and more practical results of atomic theory were 
obtained some of them with a big bang No doubt physicists were perfectly right in interpreting these successful 
applications as corroborating their theories But strangely enough they took them as confirming the instrumentalist 
creed 

Now this was an obvious mistake The instrumentalist view asserts that theories are nothing but instruments while 
the Galilean view was that they are not only instruments but alsoand mainlydescriptions of the world or of certain 

aspects of the world It is clear that in this disagreement even a proof showing that theories are instruments 
assuming it possible to prove such a thing could not seriously be claimed to support either of the two parties to the 
debate since both were agreed on this point 

If I am right or even roughly right in my account of the situation then philosophers even instrumentalist 
philosophers have no reason to take pride in their victory On the contrary they should examine their arguments 
again For at least in the eyes of those who like myself do not accept the instrumentalist view there is much at stake 
in this issue 

The issue as I see it is this 

One of the most important ingredients of our western civilization is what I may call the rationalist tradition which we 
have inherited from the Greeks It is the tradition of critical discussionnot for its own sake but in the interests of the 
search for truth Greek science like Greek philosophy was one of the products of this tradition  and of the urge to 
understand the world in which we live and the tradition founded by Galileo was its renaissance 

 

 I have explained Bohr Principle of Complementarity as I understand it after many years of effort No doubt 
I shall be told that my formulation of it is unsatisfactory But if so I am in good company for Einstein refers to it as  
Bohrs principle of complementarity a sharp formulation of which    I have been unable to attain despite much 
effort which I have expended on it Cf Albert Einstein PhilosopherScientist ed by P A Schilpp  
p  
 See ch  below 

 

 

Within this rationalist tradition science is valued admittedly for its practical achievements but it is even more highly 
valued for its informative content and for its ability to free our minds from old beliefs old prejudices and old 
certainties and to offer us in their stead new conjectures and daring hypotheses Science is valued for its liberalizing 
influenceas one of the greatest of the forces that make for human freedom 

According to the view of science which I am trying to defend here this is due to the fact that scientists have dared 
since Thales Democritus Plato Timaeus and Aristarchus to create myths or conjectures or theories which are 
in striking contrast to the everyday world of common experience yet able to explain some aspects of this world of 
common experience Galileo pays homage to Aristarchus and Copernicus precisely because they dared to go beyond 
this known world of our senses I cannot he writes  express strongly enough my unbounded admiration for the 
greatness of mind of these men who conceived the heliocentric system and held it to be true    in violent 
opposition to the evidence of their own senses    This is Galileos testimony to the liberalizing force of science 
Such theories would be important even if they were no more than exercises for our imagination But they are more 
than this as can be seen from the fact that we submit them to severe tests by trying to deduce from them some of the 
regularities of the known world of common experienceie by trying to explain these regularities And these 
attempts to explain the known by the unknown as I have described them elsewhere   have immeasurably 
extended the realm of the known They have added to the facts of our everyday world the invisible air the antipodes 
the circulation of the blood the worlds of the telescope and the microscope of electricity and of tracer atoms 

showing us in detail the movements of matter within living bodies All these things are far from being mere 
instruments they are witness to the intellectual conquest of our world by our minds 

But there is another way of looking at these matters For some science is still nothing but glorified plumbing glorified 
gadgetmakingmechanics very useful but a danger to true culture threatening us with the domination of the near
illiterate of Shakespeares mechanicals It should never be mentioned in the same breath as literature or the arts or 
philosophy Its professed discoveries are mere mechanical inventions its theories are instrumentsgadgets again or 
perhaps supergadgets It cannot and does not reveal to us new worlds behind our everyday world of appearance for 
the physical world is just surface it has no depth The world is just what it appears to be Only the 
scientific theories are not what they appear to be A scientific theory neither explains nor describes the 
world it is nothing but an instrument 

 
 Salviati says so several times with hardly a verbal variation on the Third Day of The Two Principal 
Systems 

 See the Appendix point  to ch  above and the penultimate paragraph of ch  below 

 

 

I do not present this as a complete picture of modern instrumentalism although it is a fair sketch I think of part of its 
original philosophical background Today a much more important part of it is I am well aware the rise and self
assertion of the modern mechanic or engineer  Still I believe that the issue should be seen to lie between a 
critical and adventurous rationalismthe spirit of discoveryand a narrow and defensive creed according to which we 
cannot and need not learn or understand more about our world than we know already A creed moreover which is 
incompatible with the appreciation of science as one of the greatest achievements of the human spiritSuch are the 
reasons why I shall try in this paper to uphold at least part of the Galilean view of science against the instrumentalist 
view But I cannot uphold all of it There is a part of it which I believe the instrumentalists were right to attack I mean 
the view that in science we can aim at and obtain an ultimate explanation by essences It is in its opposition 
to this Aristotelian view which I have called  essentialism that the strength and the philosophical interest of 
instrumentalism lies Thus I shall have to discuss and criticize two views of human knowledgeessentialism and 
instrumentalism And I shall oppose to them what I shall call the third viewwhat remains of Galileos view after 
the elimination of essentialism or more precisely after allowance has been made for what was justified in the 
instrumentalist attack 
 THE FIRST VIEW ULTIMATE EXPLANATION BY 
ESSENCES 
Essentialism the first of the three views of scientific theory to be discussed is part of the Galilean philosophy of 
science Within this philosophy three elements or doctrines which concern us here may be distinguished 
Essentialism our first view is that part of the Galilean philosophy which I do not wish to uphold It consists of a 
combination of the doctrines  and  These are the three doctrines 

 

The scientist aims at finding a true theory or description of the world and especially of its 
regularities or laws which shall also be an explanation of the observable facts This means that 
a description of these facts must be deducible from the theory in conjunction with certain statements the 
socalled initial conditions 

This is a doctrine I wish to uphold It is to form part of our third view 

 

The scientist can succeed in finally establishing the truth of such theories beyond all 
reasonable doubt 

This second doctrine I think needs correction All the scientist can do in my opinion is to test his theories and 
to eliminate all those that do not stand 

 
 The realization that natural science is not indubitable epistm scientia has led to the view that it is techn 
technique art technology but the proper view I believe is that it consists of doxai opinions conjectures 
controlled by critical discussion as well as by experimental techn Cf ch  below 
 See section  of my Poverty of Historicism and my Open Society and its Enemies vol I ch  
section vi and vol ii ch  sections i and ii 

 

 

 

up to the most severe tests he can design But he can never be quite sure whether new tests or even a new 
theoretical discussion may not lead him to modify or to discard his theory In this sense all theories are and 
remain hypotheses they are conjecture doxa as opposed to indubitable knowledge epistm 
The best the truly scientific theories describe the essences or the essential natures of 
thingsthe realities which lie behind the appearances Such theories are neither in need nor 
susceptible of further explanation they are ultimate explanations and to find them is the ultimate aim of 
the scientist 

This third doctrine in connection with the second is the one I have called essentialism I believe that like the second 
doctrine it is mistaken 

Now what the instrumentalist philosophers of science from Berkeley to Mach Duhem and Poincar have in 
common is this They all assert that explanation is not an aim of physical science since physical science cannot 
discover the hidden essences of things The argument shows that what they have in mind is what I call ultimate 
explanation  Some of them such as Mach and Berkeley hold this view because they do not believe that there is 
such a thing as an essence of anything physical Mach because he does not bglieve in essences at all Berkeley 
because he believes only in spiritual essences and thinks that the only essential explanation of the world is God 
Duhem seems to think on lines reminiscent of Kant   that there are essences but that they are undiscoverable by 
human science though we may somehow move towards them like Berkeley he thinks that they can be revealed by 
religion But all these philosophers agree that ultimate scientific explanation is impossible And from the absence of 
a hidden essence which scientific theories could describe they conclude that these theories which clearly do not 
describe our ordinary world of common experience describe nothing at all Thus they are mere instruments  And 

what may appear as the growth of theoretical knowledge is merely the improvement of instruments 

The instrumentalist philosophers therefore reject the third doctrine ie the doctrine of essences I reject it too but for 
somewhat different reasons At the same time they reject and are bound to reject the second doctrine for if a 
theory is an instrument then it cannot be true but only convenient simple economical powerful etc They even 
frequently call the theories hypotheses but they do not of course mean by this what I mean that a theory is 
conjectured to be true that it is a descriptive though possibly a false state 

 
 The issue has been confused at times by the fact that the instrumentalist criticism of ultimate explanation was 
expressed by some with the help of the formula the aim of science is description rather than explanation 
But what was here meant by description was the description of the ordinary empirical world and what the 
formula expressed indirectly was that those theories which do not describe in this sense do not explain either 
but are nothing but convenient instruments to help us in the description of ordinary phenomena 
 Cf Kants letter to Reinhold  in which the real essence or nature of a thing eg of matter is said to 
be inaccessible to human knowledge

ment although they do mean to say that theories are uncertain And as to the usefulness of hypotheses Osiander 
writes at the end of his preface nobody should expect anything certain to emerge from astronomy for nothing of 
the kind can ever come out of it Now I fully agree that there is no certainty about theories which may always be 
refuted and I even agree that they are instruments although I do not agree that this is the reason why there can be 
no certainty about theories The correct reason I believe is simply that our tests can never be exhaustive There is 
thus a considerable amount of agreement between my instrumentalist opponents and myself over the second and 
third doctrines But over the first doctrine there is complete disagreement 

To this disagreement I shall return later In the present section I shall try to criticize  the essentialist doctrine of 
science on lines somewhat different from the arguments of the instrumentalism which I cannot accept For its 
argument that there can be no hidden essences is based upon its conviction that there can be nothing hidden 
or that if anything is hidden it can be only known by divine revelation From what I said in the last section it will be 
clear that I cannot accept an argument that leads to the rejection of the claim of science to have discovered the 
rotation of the earth or atomic nuclei or cosmic radiation or the radio stars 

I therefore readily concede to essentialism that much is hidden from us and that much of what is hidden may be 
discovered I disagree profoundly with the spirit of Wittgensteins dictum The riddle does not exist And I do not 
even intend to criticize those who try to understand the essence of the world The essentialist doctrine I am 
contesting is solely the doctrine that science aims at ultimate explanation that is to say an explanation 
which essentially or by its very nature cannot be further explained and which is in no need of any further 
explanation 

Thus my criticism of essentialism does not aim at establishing the nonexistence of essences it merely aims at 
showing the obscurantist character of the role played by the idea of essences in the Galilean philosophy of science 
down to Maxwell who was inclined to believe in them but whose work destroyed this belief In other words my 

criticism tries to show that whether essences exist or not the belief in them does not help us in any way and indeed is 
likely to hamper us so that there is no reason why the scientist should assume their existence  

 
 This criticism of mine is thus frankly utilitarian and it might be described as instrumentalist but I am concerned 
here with a problem of method which is always a problem of the fitness of means to ends 

My attacks upon essentialismie upon the doctrine of ultimate explanationhave sometimes been 
countered by the remark that I myself operate perhaps unconsciously with the idea of an essence of science 
or an essence of human knowledge so that my argument if made explicit would run It is of the essence 
or of the nature of human science or human knowledge that we cannot know or search for such things as 
essences or natures I have however answered by implication this particular objection at some length in LSc
D sections  and  The Naturalist View of Method and I did so before it was ever raisedin fact before 
I ever came to describe and to attack essentialism Moreover one might adopt the view that certain things of 
our own makingsuch as clocksmay well be said to have essences viz their purposes and what makes 
them serve these purposes And science as a human purposeful activity or a method might therefore be 
claimed by some to have an essence even if they deny that natural objects have essences This denial is not 
however implied in my criticism of essentialism 

 

 

This I think can be best shown with the help of a simple examplethe Newtonian theory of gravity 

The essentialist interpretation of Newtonian theory is due to Roger Cotes  According to him Newton discovered 
that every particle of matter was endowed with gravity ie with an inherent power or force to attract other matter It 
was also endowed with inertiaan inherent power to resist a change in its state of motion or to retain the direction 
and velocity of its motion Since both gravity and inertia inhere in each particle of matter it follows that both must be 
strictly proportional to the amount of matter in a body and therefore to each other hence the law of proportionality of 
inert and gravitating mass Since gravity radiates from each particle we obtain the square law of attraction In other 
words Newtons laws of motion simply describe in mathematical language the state of affairs due to the inherent 
properties of matter they describe the essential nature of matter 

Since Newtons theory described in this way the essential nature of matter he could explain the behaviour of matter 
with its help by mathematical deduction But Newtons theory in its turn is neither capable of nor in need of further 
explanation according to Cotesat least not within physics The only possible further explanation was that God has 
endowed matter with these essential properties   

This essentialist view of Newtons theory was on the whole the accepted view until the last decades of the nineteenth 
century That it was obscurantist is clear it prevented fruitful questions from being raised such as What is 
the cause of gravity or more fully Can we perhaps explain gravity by deducing Newtons theory or a good 
approximation of it from a more general theory which should be independently testable 

Now it is illuminating to see that Newton himself had not considered gravity as an essential property of matter 

although he considered inertia to be essential and also with Descartes extension It appears that he had taken 
over from Descartes the view that the essence of a thing must be a true or absolute property of the thing ie a 
property which does not depend on the existence of other things such as extension or the power to resist a change 
in its state of motion and not a relational property ie a property which like gravity determines the relations 
interactions in space between one body and other bodies Accordingly he strongly felt the incompleteness of this 
theory and the need to explain gravity That gravity he wrote  should be innate

 There is an essentialist theory of Time and Space similar to this theory of matter which is due to Newton himself 
 Letter to Richard Bentley th February  ie  cf also the letter of th January 

 

 

inherent and essential to matter so that one body may act upon another at a distance    is to me so great an 
absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it 

It is interesting to see that Newton condemned here in anticipation the bulk of his followers To them one is tempted 
to remark the properties of which they had learned in school appeared to be essential and even selfevident 
although to Newton with his Cartesian background the same properties had appeared to be in need of explanation 
and indeed to be almost paradoxical 

Yet Newton himself was an essentialist He had tried hard to find an acceptable ultimate explanation of gravity by 
trying to deduce the square law from the assumption of a mechanical pushthe only kind of causal action which 
Descartes had permitted since only push could be explained by the essential property of all bodies extension  But 
he failed Had he succeeded we can be certain that he would have thought that his problem was finally solvedthat 
he had found the ultimate explanation of gravity  But here he would have been wrong The question Why can 
bodies push one another can be asked as Leibniz first saw and it is even an extremely fruitful question We now 
believe that they push one another because of certain repulsive electric forces But Cartesian and Newtonian 
essentialism especially if Newton had been successful in his attempted explanation of gravity might have prevented 
this question from ever being raised 

These examples I think make it clear that the belief in essences whether true or false is liable to create obstacles 
to thoughtto the posing of new and fruitful problems Moreover it cannot be part of science for even if we should 
by a lucky chance hit upon a theory describing essences we could never be sure of it But a creed which is likely to 
lead to obscurantism is certainly not one of those extrascientific beliefs such as a faith in the power of critical 
discussion which a scientist need accept 

This concludes my criticism of essentialism 

 THE SECOND VIEW THEORIES AS INSTRUMENTS 

The instrumentalist view has great attractions It is modest and it is very simple especially if compared with 

essentialism 

 
 This Cartesian theory of causality is of decisive importance for the whole history of physics It led to the principle 
of action by contact and later to the more abstract principle of actionat vanishing distances as I may call 
it of an action propagated from each point to its immediate vicinity ie to the principle of differential equations 
 Newton was an essentialist for whom gravity was not acceptable as an ultimate explanation but he was 
unsuccessful in his attempts to explain it further mathematically Descartes in such a situation would have 
postulated the existence of some pushmechanism he would have proposed what he called a hypothesis But 
Newton with a critical allusion to Descartes said that in this situation he was not going to invent arbitrary ad 
hoc hypotheses hypotheses non fingo Of course he could not but operate constantly with hypotheses e
g with an atomistic theory of light rays but this saying of his has been interpreted as an authoritative criticism of 
the method of hypotheses or by Duhem as a declaration of his instrumentalism 

 

 

According to essentialism we must distinguish between i the universe of essential reality ii the universe of 
observable phenomena and iii the universe of descriptive language or of symbolic representation I will take each of 
these to be represented by a square 

 

The function of a theory may here be described as follows 

a b are phenomena A B are the corresponding realities behind these appearances and   the descriptions or 
symbolic representations of these realities E are the essential properties of A B and e is the theory describing E 
Now from  and  we can deduce  this means that we can explain with the help of our theory why a leads to or is 
the cause of b 

A representation of instrumentalism can be obtained from this schema simply by omitting i ie the universe of the 
realities behind the various appearances  then directly describes a and  directly describes b and  describes 
nothingit is merely an instrument which helps us to deduce  from  This may be expressed by sayingas Schlick 
did following Wittgensteinthat a universal law or a theory is not a proper statement but rather a rule or a set of 
instructions for the derivation of singular statements from other singular statements   

This is the instrumentalist view In order to understand it better we may again take Newtonian dynamics as an 

example a and b may be taken to be two positions of two spots of light or two positions of the planet Mars  and  
are the corresponding formulae of the formalism and  is the theory strengthened by a general description of the 
solar system or by a model of the solar system Nothing corresponds to e in the world in the universe ii there 
simply are no such things as attractive forces for example Newtonian forces are not entities which determine the 
acceleration of bodies they are nothing but mathematical tools whose function is to allow us to deduce  from  

No doubt we have here an attractive simplification a radical application of Ockhams razor But although this 
simplicity has converted many to instru 

 
 For an analysis and criticism of this view see my LScD especially note  to section  and my Open 
Society note  to ch  The idea that universal statements may function in this way can be found in Mill 
Logic Book II ch III  All inference is from particulars to particulars See also G Ryle The Concept of 
Mind   ch v pp  ff for a more careful and critical formulation of the same view 

 

 

mentalism for example Mach it is by no means the strongest argument in its favour 

Berkeleys strongest argument for instrumentalism was based upon his nominalistic philosophy of language 
According to this philosophy the expression force of attraction must be a meaningless expression since forces of 
attraction can never be observed What can be observed are movements not their hidden alleged causes This is 
sufficient on Berkeleys view of language to show that Newtons theory cannot have any informative or descriptive 
content 

Now this argument of Berkeleys may perhaps be criticized because of the intolerably narrow theory of meaning 
which it implies For if consistently applied it amounts to the thesis that all dispositional words are without meaning 
Not only would Newtonian attractive forces be without meaning but also such ordinary dispositional words and 
expressions as breakable as opposed to broken or capable of conducting electricity as opposed to conducting 
electricity These are not names of anything observable and they would therefore have to be treated on a par with 
Newtonian forces But it would be awkward to classify all these expressions as meaningless and from the point of 
view of instrumentalism it is quite unnecessary to do so all that is needed is an analysis of the meaning of 
dispositional terms and dispositional statements This will reveal that they have meaning But from the point of view of 
instrumentalism they do not have a descriptive meaning like nondispositional terms and statements Their function 
is not to report events or occurrences or incidents in the world or to describe facts Rather their meaning exhausts 
itself in the permission or licence which they give us to draw inferences or to argue from some matters of fact to other 
matters of fact Nondispositional statements which describe observable matters of fact this leg is broken have 
cash value as it were dispositional statements to which belong the laws of science are not like cash but rather like 
legal instruments creating rights to cash 

One need only proceed one step further in the same direction it appears in order to arrive at an instrumentalist 
argument which it is extremely difficult if not impossible to criticize for our whole questionwhether science is 
descriptive or instrumentalis here exposed as a pseudoproblem  

The step in question consists simply in not only allowing meaningan instrumental meaningto dispositional terms 
but also a kind of descriptive meaning Dispositional words such as breakable it may be said certainly describe 
something for to say of a thing that it is breakable is to describe it as a thing that can be broken But to say of a thing 
that it is breakable or soluble is to describe it in a different way and by a different method from 

 
 I have not so far encountered in the literature this particular form of the instrumentalist argument but if we 
remember the parallelism between problems concerning the meaning of an expression and problems 
concerning the truth of a statement see for example the table in the Introduction above section xii we see that 
this argument closely corresponds to William James definition of truth as usefulness 

 

 

saying that it is broken or dissolved otherwise we should not use the suffix able The difference is just thisthat we 
describe by using dispositional words what may happen to a thing in certain circumstances Accordingly 
dispositional descriptions are descriptions but they have nevertheless a purely instrumental function In their case 
knowledge is power the power to foresee When Galileo said of the earth and yet it moves then he uttered no 
doubt a descriptive statement But the function or meaning of this statement turns out nevertheless to be purely 
instrumental it exhausts itself in the help it renders in deducing certain nondispositional statements 

Thus the attempt to show that theories have a descriptive meaning besides their instrumental meaning is 
misconceived according to this argument and the whole problemthe issue between Galileo and the Churchturns 
out to be a pseudoproblem 

In support of the view that Galileo suffered for the sake of a pseudoproblem it has been asserted that in the light of a 
logically more advanced system of physics Galileos problem has in fact dissolved into nothing Einsteins general 
principle one often hears makes it quite clear that it is meaningless to speak of absolute motion even in the case of 
rotation for we can freely choose whatever system we wish to be relatively at rest Thus Galileos problem 
vanishes Moreover it vanishes precisely for the reasons given above Astronomical knowledge can be nothing but 
knowledge of how the stars behave thus it cannot be anything but the power to describe and predict our 
observations and since these must be independent of our free choice of a coordinate system we now see more 
clearly why Galileos problem could not possibly be real 

I shall not criticize instrumentalism in this section or reply to its arguments except the very last onethe argument 
from general relativity This argument is based on a mistake From the point of view of general relativity there is very 
good senseeven an absolute sensein saying that the earth rotates it rotates in precisely that sense in 
which a bicycle wheel rotates It rotates that is to say with respect to any chosen local inertial system Indeed 
relativity describes the solar system in such a way that from this description we can deduce that any observer 
situated on any sufficiently distant freely moving physical body such as our moon or another planet or a star 
outside the system would see the earth rotating and could deduce from this observation that for its inhabitants 
there would be an apparent diurnal motion of the sun But it is clear that this is precisely the sense of the words it 
moves which was at issue for part of the issue was whether the solar system was a system like that of Jupiter and 
his moons only bigger and whether it would look like this system if seen from outside On all these questions 
Einstein unambiguously supports Galileo 

My argument should not be interpreted as an admission that the whole question can be reduced to one of 
observations or of possible observations Admittedly both Galileo and Einstein intend among other things to deduce 
what an observer or a possible observer would see But this is not their 

 

 

main problem Both investigate physical systems and their movements It is only the instrumentalist philosopher who 
asserts that what they discussed or really meant to discuss were not physical systems but ONLY the results of 
possible observations and that their socalled physical systems which appeared to be their objects of study were 
in reality only instruments for predicting observations 

 CRITICISM OF THE INSTRUMENTALIST VIEW 

Berkeleys argument we have seen depends upon the adoption of a certain philosophy of language convincing 
perhaps at first but not necessarily true Moreover it hinges on the problem of meaning  notorious for its 
vagueness and hardly offering hope of a solution The position becomes even more hopeless if we consider some 
more recent development of Berkeleys arguments as sketched in the preceding section I shall try therefore to 
force a clear decision on our problem by a different approachby way of an analysis of science rather than an 
analysis of language 

My proposed criticism of the instrumentalist view of scientific theories can be summarized as follows 

Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theoriesthe theories of the socalled pure sciences
are nothing but computation rules or inference rules of the same character fundamentally as the computation rules 
of the socalled applied sciences One might even formulate it as the thesis that pure science is a misnomer and 
that all science is applied 

Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between pure theories and 
technological computation rules and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite 
unable to account for the difference between them and the theories Thus instrumentalism collapses 

The analysis of the many functional differences between computation rules for navigation say and scientific 
theories such as Newtons is a very interesting task but a short list of results must suffice here The logical relations 
which may hold between theories and computation rules are not symmetrical and they are different from those which 
may hold between various theories and also from those which may hold between various computation rules The 
way in which computation rules are tried out is different from the way in which theories are tested and the skill 
which the application of computation rules demands is quite different from that needed for their theoretical 
discussion and for the theoretical determination of the limits of their applicability These are only a few hints but 
they may be enough to indicate the direction and the force of the argument 

I am now going to explain one of these points a little more fully because it 

 
 For this problem see my two books mentioned here in footnote  and chs   and  of the present volume 

 

 

gives rise to an argument somewhat similar to the one I have used against essentialism What I wish to discuss is the 
fact that theories are tested by attempts to refute them attempts from which we learn a great deal while there 
is nothing strictly corresponding to this in the case of technological rules of computation or calculation 

A theory is tested not merely by applying it or by trying it out but by applying it to very special casescases for which 
it yields results different from those we should have expected without that theory or in the light of other theories In 
other words we try to select for our tests those crucial cases in which we should expect the theory to fail if it is not 
true Such cases are crucial in Bacons sense they indicate the crossroads between two or more theories For to 
say that without the theory in question we should have expected a different result implies that our expectation was the 
result of some other perhaps an older theory however dimly we may have been aware of this fact But while Bacon 
believed that a crucial experiment may establish or verify a theory we shall have to say that it can at most refute or 
falsify a theory  It is an attempt to refute it and if it does not succeed in refuting the theory in questionif rather 
the theory is successful with its unexpected predictionthen we say that it is corroborated by the experiment It is the 
better corroborated  the less expected or the less probable the result of the experiment has been 

Against the view here developed one might be tempted to object following Duhem   that in every test it is not only 
the theory under investigation which is involved but also the whole system of our theories and assumptionsin fact 
more or less the whole of our knowledgeso that we can never be certain which of all these assumptions is refuted 
But this criticism overlooks the fact that if we take each of the two theories between which the crucial experiment is 
to decide together with all this background knowledge as indeed we must then we decide between two systems 
which differ only over the two theories which are at stake It further overlooks the fact that we do not assert the 
refutation of the theory as such but of the theory together with that background knowledge parts of which if other 
crucial experiments can be designed may indeed one day be rejected as responsible for the failure Thus we may 
even characterize a theory under investigation as that part of a vast system for which we have if vaguely an 
alternative in mind and for which we try to design crucial tests 

Now nothing sufficiently similar to such tests exists in the case of instruments or rules of computation An instrument 
may break down to be sure 

 
 Duhem in his famous criticism of crucial experiments in his Aim and Structure of Physical Theory 
succeeds in showing that crucial experiments can never establish a theory He fails to show that they cannot 
refute it 
 The degree of corroboration will therefore increase with the improbability or the content of the corroborating 
cases See my Degree of Confirmation Brit Jour Phil Sci  pp  ff now among the new appendices 
of my LScD and ch  of the present volume including the Addenda 

 See n  

 

or it may become outmoded But it hardly makes sense to say that we submit an instrument to the severest tests we 
can design in order to reject it if it does not stand up to them every air frame for example can be tested to 
destruction but this severe test is undertaken not in order to reject every frame when it is destroyed but to obtain 
information about the frame ie to test a theory about it so that it may be used within the limits of its 
applicability or safety 

For instrumental purposes of practical application a theory may continue to be used even after its refutation 
within the limits of its applicability an astronomer who believes that Newtons theory has turned out to be false will not 
hesitate to apply its formalism within the limits of its applicability 

We may sometimes be disappointed to find that the range of applicability of an instrument is smaller than we 
expected at first but this does not make us discard the instrument qua instrumentwhether it is a theory or anything 
else On the other hand a disappointment of this kind means that we have obtained new information through 
refuting a theorythat theory which implied that the instrument was applicable over a wider range 

Instruments even theories in so far as they are instruments cannot be refuted as we have seen The 
instrumentalist interpretation will therefore be unable to account for real tests which are attempted refutations and 
will not get beyond the assertion that different theories have different ranges of application But then it 
cannot possibly account for scientific progress Instead of saying as I should that Newtons theory was falsified by 
crucial experiments which failed to falsify Einsteins and that Einsteins theory is therefore better than Newtons the 
consistent instrumentalist will have to say with reference to his new point of view like Heisenberg It follows that we 
do not say any longer Newtons mechanics is false    Rather we now use the following formulation Classical 
mechanics    is everywhere exactly right where its concepts can be applied  

Since right here means applicable this assertion merely amounts to saying Classical mechanics is applicable 
where its concepts can be appliedwhich is not saying much But be this as it may the point is that by neglecting 
falsification and stressing application instrumentalism proves to be as obscurantist a 
philosophy as essentialism For it is only in searching for refutations that science can hope to learn and to 
advance It is only in considering how its various theories stand up to tests that it can distinguish between better and 
worse theories and so find a criterion of progress See chapter  below 

Thus a mere instrument for prediction cannot be falsified What may appear to us at first as its falsification turns out to 
be no more than a rider cautioning us about its limited applicability This is why the instrumentalist view may be used 
ad hoc for rescuing a physical theory which is threatened by 

 
 See W Heisenberg in Dialectica   p  f Heisenbergs own instrumentalism is far from consistent 
and he has many antiinstrumentalist remarks to his credit But this article here quoted may be described as an 
outandout attempt to prove that his quantum theory leads of necessity to an instrumentalist philosophy and 
thereby to the result that physical theory can never be unified or even made consistent 

 

 

 

contradictions as was done by Bohr if I am right in my interpretation given in section ii of his principle of 
complementarity If theories are mere instruments of prediction we need not discard any particular theory even 
though we believe that no consistent physical interpretation of its formalism exists 

Summing up we may say that instrumentalism is unable to account for the importance to pure science of testing 
severely even the most remote implications of its theories since it is unable to account for the pure scientists interest 
in truth and falsity In contrast to the highly critical attitude requisite in the pure scientist the attitude of 
instrumentalism like that of applied science is one of complacency at the success of applications Thus it may well 
be responsible for the recent stagnation in theoretical physics This was written before the refutation of parity 

 THE THIRD VIEW CONJECTURES TRUTH AND 
REALITY 

Neither Bacon nor Berkeley believed that the earth rotates but nowadays everybody believes it including the 
physicists Instrumentalism is embraced by Bohr and Heisenberg only as a way out of the special difficulties which 
have arisen in quantum theory 

The motive is hardly sufficient It is always difficult to interpret the latest theories and they sometimes perplex even 
their own creators as happened with Newton Maxwell at first inclined towards an essentialist interpretation of his 
theory a theory which ultimately contributed more than any other to the decline of essentialism And Einstein inclined 
at first to an instrumentalist interpretation of relativity giving a kind of operational analysis of the concept of 
simultaneity which contributed more to the present vogue for instrumentalism than anything else but he later 
repented  

I trust that physicists will soon come to realize that the principle of complementarity is ad hoc and what is more 
important that its only function is to avoid criticism and to prevent the discussion of physical interpretations though 
criticism and discussion are urgently needed for reforming any theory They will then no longer believe that 
instrumentalism is forced upon them by the structure of contemporary physical theory 

Anyway instrumentalism is as I have tried to show no more acceptable than essentialism Nor is there any need to 
accept either of them for there is a third view  

This third view is not very startling or even surprising I think It preserves the Galilean doctrine that the scientist aims 
at a true description of the world or of some of its aspects and at a true explanation of observable facts and it 
combines this doctrine with the nonGalilean view that though this remains the aim of the scientist he can never 
know for certain whether his findings are 

 
 Note added to the proofs When this paper went to press Albert Einstein was still alive and I intended to 
send him a copy as soon as it was printed My remark referred to a conversation we had on the subject in  

 Cf section v of ch  below 

 

true although he may sometimes establish with reasonable certainty that a theory is false  

One may formulate this third view of scientific theories briefly by saying that they are genuine conjectures
highly informative guesses about the world which although not verifiable ie capable of being shown to be true can 
be submitted to severe critical tests They are serious attempts to discover the truth In this respect scientific 
hypotheses are exactly like Goldbachs famous conjecture in the theory of numbers Goldbach thought that it might 
possibly be true and it may well be true in fact even though we do not know and may perhaps never 
know whether it is true or not 

I shall confine myself to mentioning only a few aspects of my third view and only such aspects as distinguish it from 
essentialism and instrumentalism and I shall take essentialism first 

Essentialism looks upon our ordinary world as mere appearance behind which it discovers the real world This view 
has to be discarded once we become conscious of the fact that the world of each of our theories may be explained in 
its turn by further worlds which are described by further theoriestheories of a higher level of abstraction of 
universality and of testability The doctrine of an essential or ultimate reality collapses together with that of 
ultimate explanation 

Since according to our third view the new scientific theories are like the old ones genuine conjectures they are 
genuine attempts to describe these further worlds Thus we are led to take all these worlds including our ordinary 
world as equally real or better perhaps as equally real aspects or layers of the real world If looking through a 
microscope we change its magnification then we may see various completely different aspects or layers of the same 
thing all equally real It is thus mistaken to say that my piano as I know it is real while its alleged molecules and 
atoms are mere logical constructions or whatever else may be indicative of their unreality just as it is mistaken to 
say that atomic theory shows that the piano of my everyday world is an appearance onlya doctrine which is clearly 
unsatisfactory once we see that the atoms in their turn may perhaps be explained as disturbances or structures of 
disturbances in a quantised field of forces or perhaps of probabilities All these conjectures are equal in their claims 
to describe reality although some of them are more conjectural than others 

Thus we shall not for example describe only the socalled primary qualities of a body such as its geometrical 
shape as real and contrast them as the essentialists once did with its unreal and merely apparent secondary 
qualities such as colour For the extension and even the shape of a body have since become objects of 
explanation in terms of theories of a higher level of theories describing a further and deeper layer of realityforces 
and fields of forceswhich are related to the primary qualities in the same way as these were believed by the 
essentialists to be related to the secondary ones and the 

 
 Cf the discussion of this point in section v above and LScD passim also ch  above and Xenophanes 
fragments quoted towards the end of ch  below 

 

 

 

secondary qualities such as colours are just as real as the primary onesthough our colour experiences have to be 
distinguished from the colourproperties of the physical things exactly as our geometricalshapeexperiences have to 
be distinguished from the geometricalshapeproperties of the physical things From our point of view both kinds of 
qualities are equally real and so are forces and fields of forcesin spite of their undoubted hypothetical or 
conjectural character 

Although in one sense of the word real all these various levels are equally real there is another yet closely related 
sense in which we might say that the higher and more conjectural levels are the more real onesin spite of the fact 
that they are more conjectural They are according to our theories more real more stable in intention more 
permanent in the sense in which a table or a tree or a star is more real than any of its aspects 

But is not just this conjectural or hypothetical character of our theories the reason why we should not ascribe reality to 
the worlds described by them Should we not even if we find Berkeleys to be is to be perceived too narrow call 
only those states of affairs real which are described by true statements rather than by conjectures 
which may turn out to be false With these questions we turn to the discussion of the instrumentalist doctrine which 
with its assertion that theories are mere instruments intends to deny the claim that anything like a real world is 
described by them 

I accept the view implicit in the classical or correspondence theory of truth   that we should call a state of affairs 
real if and only if the statement describing it is true But it would be a grave mistake to conclude from this that the 
uncertainty of a theory ie its hypothetical or conjectural character diminishes in any way its implicit claim to 
describe something real For every statement s is equivalent to a statement claiming that s is true And as to s being 
a conjecture we must remember that first of all a conjecture may be true and thus describe a real state of affairs 
Secondly if it is false then it contradicts some real state of affairs described by its true negation Moreover if we 
test our conjecture and succeed in falsifying it we see very clearly that there was a realitysomething with which it 
could clash 

Our falsifications thus indicate the points where we have touched reality as it were And our latest and best theory is 
always an attempt to incorporate 

 
 See A Tarski work on the Concept of Truth  Der Wahrheitsbegriff etc Studia Philosophica 
 text to note  truein agreement with reality See the English translation in A 
Tarski Logic Semantics Metamathematics  p  the translation says 
corresponding where I translated in agreement The following remarks and also the 
penultimate paragraph before the one to which this footnote is appended have been added 
in an attempt to answer a friendly criticism privately communicated to me by Professor 
Alexander Koyr to whom I feel greatly indebted 

I do not think that if we accept the suggestion that in agreement with reality and true are 
equivalent we are seriously in danger of being led up the path to idealism I do not propose 
to define real with the help of this equivalence And even if I did there is no reason to 
believe that a definition necessarily determines the ontological status of the term defined 
What the equivalence should help us to see is that the hypothetical character of a statement 
ie our uncertainty as to its truthimplies that we are making guesses concerning reality 

 

all the falsifications ever found in the field by explaining them in the simplest way and this means as I have tried to 
show in The Logic of Scientific Discovery sections  to  in the most testable way 

Admittedly if we do not know how to test a theory we may be doubtful whether there is anything at all of the kind or 
level described by it and if we positively know that it cannot be tested then our doubts will grow we may suspect 
that it is a mere myth or a fairytale But if a theory is testable then it implies that events of a certain 
kind cannot happen and so it asserts something about reality This is why we demand that the more 
conjectural a theory is the higher should be its degree of testability Testable conjectures or guesses at any rate 
are thus conjectures or guesses about reality from their uncertain or conjectural character it only follows that our 
knowledge concerning the reality they describe is uncertain or conjectural And although only that is certainly real 
which can be known with certainty it is a mistake to think that only that is real which is known to be certainly real We 
are not omniscient and no doubt much is real that is unknown to us all It is thus indeed the old Berkeleian mistake 
in the form to be is to be known which still underlies instrumentalism 

Theories are our own inventions our own ideas they are not forced upon us but are our selfmade instruments of 
thought this has been clearly seen by the idealist But some of these theories of ours can clash with reality and 
when they do we know that there is a reality that there is something to remind us of the fact that our ideas may be 
mistaken And this is why the realist is right 

Thus I agree with essentialism in its view that science is capable of real discoveries and even in its view that 
in discovering new worlds our intellect triumphs over our sense experience But I do not fall into the mistake of 
Parmenidesof denying reality to all that is colourful varied individual indeterminate and indescribable in our world 

Since I believe that science can make real discoveries I take my stand with Galileo against instrumentalism I admit 
that our discoveries are conjectural But this is even true of geographical explorations Columbus conjectures as to 
what he had discovered were in fact mistaken and Peary could only conjectureon the basis of theoriesthat he had 
reached the Pole But these elements of conjecture do not make their discoveries less real or less significant 

There is an important distinction which we can make between two kinds of scientific prediction and which 
instrumentalism cannot make a distinction which is connected with the problem of scientific discovery I have in mind 
the distinction between the prediction of events of a kind which is known such as eclipses or thunderstorms 
on the one hand and on the other hand the prediction of new kinds of events which the physicist calls new 
effects such as the prediction which led to the discovery of wireless waves or of zeropoint energy or to the artificial 
building up of new elements not previously found in nature 

 

 

 

It seems to me clear that instrumentalism can account only for the first kind of prediction if theories are instruments 
for prediction then we must assume that their purpose must be determined in advance as with other instruments 
Predictions of the second kind can be fully understood only as discoveries 

It is my belief that our discoveries are guided by theory in these as in most other cases rather than that theories are 
the result of discoveries due to observation for observation itself tends to be guided by theory Even geographical 
discoveries  Columbus Franklin the two Nordenskjlds Nansen Wegener and Heyerdahls KonTiki expedition 
are often undertaken with the aim of testing a theory Not to be content with offering predictions but to create new 
situations for new kinds of tests this is a function of theories which instrumentalism can hardly explain without 
surrendering its main tenets 

But perhaps the most interesting contrast between the third view and instrumentalism arises in connection with the 
latters denial of the descriptive function of abstract words and of dispositionwords This doctrine by the way 
exhibits an essentialist strain within instrumentalismthe belief that events or occurrences or incidents which are 
directly observable must be in a sense more real than dispositions which are not 

The third view of this matter is different I hold that most observations are more or less indirect and that it is doubtful 
whether the distinction between directly observable incidents and whatever is only indirectly observable leads us 
anywhere I cannot but think that it is a mistake to denounce Newtonian forces the causes of acceleration as 
occult and to try to discard them as has been suggested in favour of accelerations For accelerations cannot be 
observed any more directly than forces and they are just as dispositional the statement that a bodys velocity is 
accelerated tells us that the bodys velocity in the next second from now will exceed its present velocity 

In my opinion all universals are dispositional If breakable is dispositional so is broken considering for 
example how a doctor decides whether a bone is broken or not Nor should we call a glass broken if the pieces 
would fuse the moment they were put together the criterion of being broken is behaviour under certain 
conditions Similarly red is dispositional a thing is red if it is able to reflect a certain kind of lightif it looks red in 
certain situations But even looking red is dispositional It describes the disposition of a thing to make onlookers 
agree that it looks red 

No doubt there are degrees of dispositional character able to conduct electricity is dispositional in a higher degree 
than conducting electricity now which is still very highly dispositional These degrees correspond fairly closely to 
those of the conjectural or hypothetical character of theories But there is no point in denying reality to dispositions 
not even if we deny reality to all universals and to all states of affairs including incidents and confine ourselves to 
using that sense of the word real which from the point of view of ordinary usage is the narrowest and safest to call 
only physical bodies 

 

 

real and only those which are neither too small nor too big nor too distant to be easily seen and handled 

For even then we should realize as I wrote twenty years ago   that 

every description uses    universals every statement has the character of a theory a hypothesis 
The statement Here is a glass of water cannot be completely verified by any senseexperience 
because the universals which appear in it cannot be correlated with any particular senseexperience 
An immediate experience is only once immediately given it is unique By the word glass for 
example we denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain lawlike behaviour and the same 
holds of the word water 

I do not think that a language without universals could ever work and the use of universals commits us to asserting 
and thus at least to conjecturing the reality of dispositionsthough not of ultimate and inexplicable ones that is of 
essences We may express all this by saying that the customary distinction between observational terms or 
nontheoretical terms and theoretical terms is mistaken since all terms are theoretical to some degree though 
some are more theoretical than others just as we said that all theories are conjectural though some are more 
conjectural than others 

But if we are committed or at least prepared to conjecture the reality of forces and of fields of forces then there is 
no reason why we should not conjecture that a die has a definite propensity or disposition to fall on one or 
another of its sides that this propensity can be changed by loading it that propensities of this kind may change 
continuously and that we may operate with fields of propensities or of entities which determine propensities An 
interpretation of probability on these lines might allow us to give a new physical interpretation to quantum theoryone 
which differs from the purely statistical interpretation due to Born while agreeing with him that probability statements 
can be tested only statistically  And this interpretation may perhaps be of some little help in our efforts to resolve 
those grave and challenging difficulties in quantum theory which today seem to imperil the Galilean tradition

TOWARDS A RATIONAL THEORY OF TRADITION 

IN THE title of this talk the emphasis should be put on the word towards I do not intend to put forward anything like 
a full theory I want to explain to you and to illustrate the kind of question which a theory of tradition would have to 
answer and to give in outline some ideas which may be useful for constructing it By way of introduction I intend to 
say how I came to be interested in the subject and why I think it is important and I also intend to refer to some 
possible attitudes towards it 

I am a rationalist of sorts I am not quite certain whether or not my rationalism will be acceptable to you but that will 
be seen later I am very interested in scientific method Having studied for some time the methods of the natural 
sciences I felt that it might be interesting to study also the methods of the social sciences It was then that I first met 
with the problem of tradition The antirationalists in the field of politics social theory and so on usually suggest that 
this problem cannot be tackled by any kind of rational theory Their attitude is to accept tradition as something just 
given You have to take it you cannot rationalize it it plays an important role in society and you can only understand 
its significance and accept it The most important name associated with this antirationalist view is that of Edmund 
Burke He fought as you know against the ideas of the French Revolution and his most effective weapon was his 
analysis of the importance of that irrational power which we call tradition I mention Burke because I think he has 
never been properly answered by rationalists Instead rationalists tended to ignore his criticism and to persevere in 
their antitraditionalist attitude without taking up the challenge Undoubtedly there is a traditional hostility between 
rationalism and traditionalism Rationalists are inclined to adopt the attitude I am not interested in tradition I want to 
judge everything on its own merits I want to find out its merits and demerits and I want to do this quite in 

 

Transcript of lecture given at the Third Annual Conference of the Rationalist Press Association on 
th July  at Magdalen College Oxford first published in The Rationalist Annual  

 

 

dependently of any tradition I want to judge it with my own brain and not with the brains of other people who lived 
long ago 

That the matter is not quite so simple as this attitude assumes emerges from the fact that the rationalist who says 
such things is himself very much bound by a rationalist tradition which traditionally says them This shows the 
weakness of certain traditional attitudes towards the problem of tradition 

Our Chairman  has told us today that we need not bother about the antirationalist reaction that it is very weak if not 
negligible But I feel that there does exist an antirationalist reaction of a serious kind and among very clever men 
and that it is connected with this particular problem Quite a number of outstanding thinkers have developed the 
problem of tradition into a big stick with which to beat rationalism I may instance Michael Oakeshott a Cambridge 
historian a really original thinker who recently in the Cambridge Journal launched an attack on rationalism I 
largely disagree with his strictures but I have to admit that the attack is a powerful one When he launched it there 

was not much in the rationalist literature which could be considered an adequate answer to his arguments Some 
answers may exist but I very much doubt their adequacy This is one of the reasons why I feel that this subject is 
important 

Another thing which induced me to take up this question was simply my own experiencemy own change of social 
environment I came to England from Vienna and I found that the atmosphere here in England was very different 
from that in which I had been brought up We heard this morning from Dr J A C Brown  some interesting remarks 
about the great importance of what he calls the atmosphere of a factory I am sure that he would agree that this 
atmosphere has something to do with tradition I moved from a Continental tradition or atmosphere to an English one 
and later for a time to that of New Zealand These changes have no doubt stimulated me to think about these 
matters and try to look further into them 

Certain types of tradition of great importance are local and cannot easily be transplanted These traditions are 
precious things and it is very difficult to restore them once they are lost I have in mind the scientific tradition in 
which I am particularly interested I have seen that it is very difficult to transplant it from the few places where it has 
really taken root Two thousand years ago this tradition was destroyed in Greece and it did not take root again for a 
very long time Similarly recent attempts to transplant it from England overseas have not been too successful 
Nothing is more striking than the lack of a research tradition in some of the countries overseas One has a real 
struggle if one wants it to take root where it is missing I may perhaps mention that at the time when I left New 
Zealand the Chancellor of the University undertook a thorough inquiry into the question of research As a result of it 
he made an excellent critical speech in which he denounced the 

 

 The Chairman of the meeting was Professor A E Heath 
 The allusion is to the lecture Rational and Irrational Behaviour in Industrial Groups summarized in The 
Literary Guide October  

 

 

University for its neglect of research But few will think that this speech means that a scientific research tradition will 
now be established for this is a very hard thing to bring about One can convince people of the need for such a 
tradition but that does not mean that the tradition will take root and flourish 

I could of course take examples from fields other than science To remind you that it is not only the scientific field in 
which tradition is importantalthough it is the field about which I shall mainly speakI need only mention music When 
I was in New Zealand I got hold of a set of American records of Mozart Requiem When I had played these 
records I knew what the lack of musical tradition meant They had been made under the directorship of a musician 
who was obviously untouched by the tradition which has come down from Mozart The result was devastating I shall 
not dwell on this matter I mention it only to make it clear that when I select for my main illustration the question of the 
scientific or rational tradition I do not mean to convey the impression that it is either the most important or the only 
one 

It should be clearly understood that there are only two main attitudes possible towards tradition One is to accept a 
tradition uncritically often without even being aware of it In many cases we cannot escape this for we often just 
do not realize that we are faced with a tradition If I wear my watch on my left wrist I need not be conscious that I am 

accepting a tradition Every day we do hundreds of things under the influence of traditions of which we are unaware 
But if we do not know that we are acting under the influence of a tradition then we cannot help accepting the tradition 
uncritically 

The other possibility is a critical attitude which may result either in acceptance or in rejection or perhaps in a 
compromise Yet we have to know of and to understand a tradition before we can criticize it before we can say We 
reject this tradition on rational grounds Now I do not think that we could ever free ourselves entirely from the bonds 
of tradition The socalled freeing is really only a change from one tradition to another But we can free ourselves from 
the taboos of a tradition and we can do that not only by rejecting it but also by critically accepting it We free 
ourselves from the taboo if we think about it and if we ask ourselves whether we should accept it or reject it In 
order to do that we have first to have the tradition clearly before us and we have to understand in a general way what 
may be the function and significance of a tradition That is why it is so important for rationalists to deal with this 
problem for rationalists are those people who are ready to challenge and to criticize everything including I hope 
their own tradition They are ready to put questionmarks to anything at least in their minds They will not submit 
blindly to any tradition 

I should say that in our invaluable rationalist tradition which rationalists so often accept too uncritically there are 
quite a few points which we ought to challenge A part of the rationalist tradition is for example the meta 

 

 

physical idea of determinism People who do not agree with determinism are usually viewed with suspicion by 
rationalists who are afraid that if we accept indeterminism we may be committed to accepting the doctrine of Free 
Will and may thus become involved in theological arguments about the Soul and Divine Grace I usually avoid talking 
about free will because I am not clear enough about what it means and I even suspect that our intuition of a free will 
may mislead us Nevertheless I think that determinism is a theory which is untenable on many grounds and that we 
have no reason whatever to accept it Indeed I think that it is important for us to get rid of the determinist element in 
the rationalist tradition It is not only untenable but it creates endless trouble for us It is for this reason important to 
realize that indeterminismthat is the denial of determinismdoes not necessarily involve us in any doctrine about 
our will or about responsibility 

Another element in the rationalist tradition which we should question is the idea of observationalismthe idea that we 
know about the world because we look around open our eyes and ears and take down what we see hear and so 
on and that this is what constitutes the material of our knowledge This is an extremely deeprooted prejudice and is 
I think an idea which impedes the understanding of scientific method I shall return to this point later So much by 
way of introduction 

Now I come to a brief outline of the task of a theory of tradition A theory of tradition must be a sociological theory 
because tradition is obviously a social phenomenon I mention this because I wish briefly to discuss with you the 
task of the theoretical social sciences This has often been misunderstood In order to explain what is I think 
the central task of social science I should like to begin by describing a theory which is held by very many rationalists
a theory which I think implies exactly the opposite of the true aim of the social sciences I shall call this theory the 
conspiracy theory of society This theory which is more primitive than most forms of theism is akin to Homers 
theory of society Homer conceived the power of the gods in such a way that whatever happened on the plain before 
Troy was only a reflection of the various conspiracies on Olympus The conspiracy theory of society is just a version 

of this theism of a belief in gods whose whims and wills rule everything It comes from abandoning God and then 
asking Who is in his place His place is then filled by various powerful men and groupssinister pressure groups 
who are to be blamed for having planned the great depression and all the evils from which we suffer 

The conspiracy theory of society is very widespread and has very little truth in it Only when conspiracy theoreticians 
come into power does it become something like a theory which accounts for things which actually happen a case of 
what I have called the Oedipus Effect For example when Hitler came into power believing in the conspiracy myth 
of the Learned Elders of Zion he tried to outdo their conspiracy with his own counterconspiracy But the interesting 
thing is that such a conspiracy neveror hardly everturns out in the way that is intended 

 

 

This remark can be taken as a clue to what is the true task of a social theory Hitler I said made a conspiracy that 
failed Why did it fail Not just because other people conspired against Hitler It failed simply because it is one of the 
striking things about social life that nothing ever comes off exactly as intended Things always turn out a 
little bit differently We hardly ever produce in social life precisely the effect that we wish to produce and we usually 
get things that we do not want into the bargain Of course we act with certain aims in mind but apart from the 
question of these aims which we may or may not really achieve there are always certain unwanted consequences of 
our actions and usually these unwanted consequences cannot be eliminated 

I will give you a very simple example Let us say that a man in a small village must sell his house Not long before 
there was a man who bought a house in that village because he needed one urgently Now there is a seller He will 
find that under normal conditions he will not get nearly as much for his house as the buyer had to pay when he 
wanted to buy a similar one That is to say the very fact that somebody wants to sell his house lowers the market 
price And this is generally so Whoever wants to sell something always depresses the market value of what he wants 
to sell whoever wants to buy something raises the market value of what he wants to buy This is true of course only 
for small free markets I do not say that the economic system of free markets cannot be replaced by another one But 
in a market economy this is what happens You will agree with me that there is no need to prove that the man who 
wants to sell something has usually no intention of lowering the market price and that the man who wants to buy 
something has no intention of raising it We have here a typical instance of unwanted consequences 

The situation described is typical of the social situation In all social situations we have individuals who do things 
who want things who have certain aims In so far as they act in the way in which they want to act and realize the 
aims which they intend to realize no problem arises for the social sciences except the problem whether their wants 
and aims can perhaps be socially explained for example by certain traditions The characteristic problems of the 
social sciences arise only out of our wish to know the unintended consequences and more especially the 
unwanted consequences which may arise if we do certain things We wish to foresee not only the direct 
consequences but also these unwanted indirect consequences Why should we wish to foresee them Either 
because of our scientific curiosity or because we want to be prepared for them we may wish if possible to meet 
them and prevent them from becoming too important This means again action and with it the creation of further 
unwanted consequences 

I think that the people who approach the social sciences with a readymade conspiracy theory thereby deny 
themselves the possibility of ever understanding what the task of the social sciences is for they assume that we can 
explain practically everything in society by asking who wanted it whereas 

 

 

the real task of the social sciences  is to explain those things which nobody wantssuch as for example a war or a 
depression  Lenins revolution and especially Hitlers revolution and Hitlers war are I think exceptions These were 
indeed conspiracies But they were consequences of the fact that conspiracy theoreticians came into powerwho 
most significantly failed to consummate their conspiracies 

It is the task of social theory to explain how the unintended consequences of our intentions and actions arise and 
what kind of consequences arise if people do this that or the other in a certain social situation And it is especially 
the task of the social sciences to analyse in this way the existence and the functioning of institutions such as 
police forces or insurance companies or schools or governments and of social collectives such as states or 
nations or classes or other social groups The conspiracy theorist will believe that institutions can be understood 
completely as the result of conscious design and as to collectives he usually ascribes to them a kind of group
personality treating them as conspiring agents just as if they were individual men As opposed to this view the 
social theorist should recognize that the persistence of institutions and collectives creates a problem to be solved in 
terms of an analysis of individual social actions and their unintended and often unwanted social consequences as 
well as their intended ones The task of a theory of tradition must be viewed in a similar light It is only very rarely that 
people consciously wish to create a tradition and even in these cases they are not likely to succeed On the other 
hand people who never dreamt of creating a tradition may nevertheless do so without having any such intention 
Thus we arrive at one of the problems of the theory of tradition how do traditions ariseand more important how do 
they persistas the possibly unintended consequences of peoples actions 

A second and more important problem is this what is the function of tradition in social life Has it any function which 
is rationally understandable in the way in which we can give an account of the function of schools or of the police 
force or of a grocers shop the Stock Exchange or other such social institutions Can we analyse the functions 
of traditions That is perhaps the main task of a theory of tradition My way of approaching this task will be to analyse 
a particular traditionthe rational or scientific traditionas an example and I intend later to make use of this analysis 
for various purposes 

 

 In the discussion which followed the lecture I was criticized for rejecting the conspiracy theory and it was 
asserted that Karl Marx had revealed the tremendous importance of the capitalist conspiracy for the 
understanding of society In my reply I said that I should have mentioned my indebtedness to Marx who was 
one of the first critics of the conspiracy theory and one of the first to analyse the unintended 
consequences of the voluntary actions of people acting in certain social situations Marx said quite definitely and 
clearly that the capitalist is as much caught in the network of the social situation or the social system as is the 
worker that the capitalist cannot help acting in the way he does he is as unfree as the worker and the results of 
his actions are largely unintended But the truly scientific approach of Marx has been forgotten by his latterday 
followers the Vulgar Marxists who have put forward a popular conspiracy theory of society which is no better 
than Goebbels myth of the Learned Elders of Zion 

 

My main purpose will be to draw a parallel between on the one side the theories which after submitting them to 
scientific tests we hold as a result of the rational or critical attitudein the main that is scientific hypothesesand the 
way they help us to orientate ourselves in this world and on the other side beliefs attitudes and traditions in 
general and the way they may help us to orientate ourselves especially in the social world 

The peculiar thing which we call scientific tradition has often been discussed People have often wondered about this 
queer thing that happened somehow somewhere in Greece in the sixth and fifth centuries before Christ the 
invention of a rational philosophy What did actually happen why did it happen and how Some modern thinkers 
assert that the Greek philosophers were the first to try to understand what happens in nature I shall show you why 
this is an unsatisfactory account 

The early Greek philosophers did indeed try to understand what happened in nature But so did the more primitive 
mythmakers before them How can we characterize that primitive type of explanation which was superseded by the 
standards of the early Greek philosophersthe founders of our scientific tradition To put it crudely the prescientific 
mythmakers said when they saw a thunderstorm approaching Oh yes Zeus is angry And when they saw that the 
sea was rough they said  Poseidon is angry That was the type of explanation which was found satisfactory before 
the rationalist tradition introduced new standards of explanation What was really the decisive difference One can 
hardly say that the new theories introduced by the Greek philosophers were more easily understood than the old 
ones It is I think much easier to understand the statement that Zeus is angry than to understand a scientific account 
of a thunderstorm And the statement that Poseidon is angry is for me a much simpler and more easily 
understandable explanation of the high waves of the sea than one in terms of friction between the air and the surface 
of the water 

I think that the innovation which the early Greek philosophers introduced was roughly this they began to discuss 
these matters Instead of accepting the religious tradition uncritically and as unalterable like children who protest if 
aunty alters one word of their favourite fairytale instead of merely handing on a tradition they challenged it and 
sometimes even invented a new myth in place of the old one We have I think to admit that the new stories which 
they put in the place of the old were fundamentally mythsjust as the old stories were but there are two things about 
them to be noticed 

First they were not just repetitions or rearrangements of the old stories but contained new elements Not that this in 
itself is a very great virtue But the second and main thing is this the Greek philosophers invented a new tradition
the tradition of adopting a critical attitude towards the myths the tradition of discussing them the tradition of not only 
telling a myth but also of being challenged by the man to whom it is told Telling their myth they were ready in their 
turn to listen to what their listener thought about itadmitting thereby the possibility that he might perhaps have a 
better explana 

 

 

 

tion than they This was a thing that had not happened before A new way of asking questions arose Together with 
the explanationthe myththe question would arise Can you give me a better account and another philosopher 
might answer Yes I can Or he might say I do not know whether I can give you a better but I can give you a very 
different account which does just as well These two accounts cannot both be true so there must be something 
wrong here We cannot simply accept these two accounts Nor have we any reason to accept just one of them We 
really want to know more about the matter We have to discuss it further We have to see whether our explanations 
really do account for the things about which we already know and perhaps even for something we have so far 
overlooked 

My thesis is that what we call science is differentiated from the older myths not by being something distinct from a 
myth but by being accompanied by a secondorder traditionthat of critically discussing the myth Before there was 
only the firstorder tradition A definite story was handed on Now there was still of course a story to be handed on 
but with it went something like a silent accompanying text of a secondorder character I hand it on to you but tell me 
what you think of it Think it over Perhaps you can give us a different story This secondorder tradition was the 
critical or argumentative attitude It was I believe a new thing and it is still the fundamentally important thing about 
scientific tradition If we understand that then we shall have an altogether different attitude towards quite a number of 
problems of scientific method We shall understand that in a certain sense science is mythmaking just as religion is 
You will say But the scientific myths are so very different from the religious myths Certainly they are different But 
why are they different Because if one adopts this critical attitude then ones myths do become different They 
change and they change in the direction of giving a better and better account of the worldof the various things 
which we can observe And they also challenge us to observe things which we would never have observed without 
these theories or myths 

In the critical discussions which now arose there also arose for the first time something like systematic 
observation The man to whom a myth was handed on together with the silent but traditional request What have you 
to say about it Can you criticize itthis man would take the myth and would apply it to the various things which it 
was supposed to explain such as the movement of the planets Then he would say I do not think that this myth is 
very good because it does not explain the actual observable movement of the planets or whatever it might be Thus 
it is the myth or the theory which leads to and guides our systematic observationsobservations undertaken with the 
intention of probing into the truth of the theory or the myth From this point of view the growth of the theories of 
science should not be considered as the result of the collection or accumulation of observations on the contrary the 
observations and their accumulation should be considered as the result of the growth of the scientific theories This 
is what I have called the searchlight theory of sciencethe view that science itself throws 

 

 

new light on things that it not only solves problems but that in doing so it creates many more and that it not only 
profits from observations but leads to new ones If in this way we look out for new observations with the intention of 
probing into the truth of our myths we need not be astonished if we find that myths handled in this rough manner 
change their character and that in time they become what one might call more realistic or that they agree better with 
observable facts In other words under the pressure of criticism the myths are forced to adapt themselves to the task 
of giving us an adequate and a more detailed picture of the world in which we live This explains why scientific myths 
under the pressure of criticism become so different from religious myths I think however we should be quite clear 
that in their origin they remain myths or inventions just like the others They are not what some rationaliststhe 
adherents of the senseobservation theorybelieve they are not digests of observations Let me repeat this important 
point Scientific theories are not just the results of observation They are in the main the products of mythmaking 
and of tests Tests proceed partly by way of observation and observation is thus very important but its function is not 
that of producing theories It plays its role in rejecting eliminating and criticizing theories and it challenges us to 
produce new myths new theories which may stand up to these observational tests Only if we understand this can we 
understand the importance of tradition for science 

Those among you who hold the opposite view and who believe that scientific theories are the result of observations I 
challenge to start observing here and now and to give me the scientific results of your observations You may say that 
this is unfair and that there is nothing very remarkable to observe here and now But even if you go on to the end of 
your lives notebook in hand writing down everything you observe and if you finally bequeath this important 
notebook to the Royal Society asking them to make science out of it then the Royal Society might preserve it as a 
curiosity but decidedly not as a source of knowledge  It might be lost perhaps in some cellar of the British Museum 
which as you may know cannot afford to catalogue most of its treasures but more likely it will end up on a rubbish 
heap 

But you may get something of scientific interest if you say Here are the theories which some scientists hold today 
These theories demand that such and such things should be observable under such and such conditions Let us see 
whether they are observable In other words if you select your observations with an eye on scientific problems and 
the general situation of science as it appears at the moment then you may well be able to make a contribution to 
science I do not want to be dogmatic and to deny that there are exceptions such as the socalled chance 
discoveries Though even these very often turn out to be made under the influence of theories I do not say that 
observations are always insignificant unless they are related to theories but I want to point out what is the main 
procedure in the development of science 

 
 See ch  section IV 

 

 

All this means that a young scientist who hopes to make discoveries is badly advised if his teacher tells him Go 
round and observe and that he is well advised if his teacher tells him Try to learn what people are discussing 
nowadays in science Find out where difficulties arise and take an interest in disagreements These are the 
questions which you should take up In other words you should study the problem situation of the day This 
means that you pick up and try to continue a line of inquiry which has the whole background of the earlier 
development of science behind it you fall in with the tradition of science It is a very simple and a decisive point but 
nevertheless one that is often not sufficiently realized by rationaliststhat we cannot start afresh that we must make 
use of what people before us have done in science If we start afresh then when we die we shall be about as far as 
Adam and Eve were when they died or if you prefer as far as Neanderthal man In science we want to make 
progress and this means that we must stand on the shoulders of our predecessors We must carry on a certain 
tradition From the point of view of what we want as scientistsunderstanding prediction analysis and so onthe 
world in which we live is extremely complex I should be tempted to say that it is infinitely complex if the phrase had 
any meaning We do not know where or how to start our analysis of this world There is no wisdom to tell us Even 
the scientific tradition does not tell us It only tells us where and how other people started and where they got to It 
tells us that people have already constructed in this world a kind of theoretical frameworknot perhaps a very good 
one but one which works more or less it serves us as a kind of network as a system of coordinates to which we 
can refer the various complexities of this world We use it by checking it over and by criticizing it In this way we 
make progress 

It is necessary for us to see that of the two main ways in which we may explain the growth of science one is rather 
unimportant and the other is important The first explains science by the accumulation of knowledge it is like a 
growing library or a museum As more and more books accumulate so more and more knowledge accumulates 
The other explains it by criticism it grows by a more revolutionary method than accumulationby a method which 
destroys changes and alters the whole thing including its most important instrument the language in which our 
myths and theories are formulated 

It is interesting to see that the first method the accumulation method is much less important than people believe 
There is much less accumulation of knowledge in science than there is revolutionary changing of scientific theories It 
is a strange point and a very interesting point because one might at first sight believe that for the accumulative 
growth of knowledge tradition would be very important and that for the revolutionary kind of development tradition 
would be less important But it is exactly the other way round If science could grow by mere accumulation it would 
not matter so much if the scientific tradition were lost because any day you could start accumulating afresh 
Something would be lost but the loss would not be 

 

 

serious If however science advances by the tradition of changing its traditional myths then you need something 
with which to start If you have nothing to alter and to change you can never get anywhere Thus you need two 
beginnings for science new myths and a new tradition of changing them critically But such beginnings are very 
rarely made It took I do not know how many years from the invention of a descriptive languagewhich we may say 
was the moment when man became manto the beginnings of science Throughout this time language the future 
instrument of science was growing It grew together with the growth of mythevery language incorporates and 
preserves countless myths and theories even in its grammatical structureand with the growth of the tradition which 
uses language for the purpose of describing facts and for explaining and arguing about facts About this more later 
If these traditions were destroyed you could not even start accumulating the instrument for it would be missing 

Having given this example of the role played by tradition in one particular fieldthat of scienceI shall now somewhat 
belatedly proceed to the problem of a sociological theory of tradition I again refer to Dr J A C Brown my 
predecessor today who said many things which are very relevant to my topic and especially one thing of which I 
have made a note He said that if there is no discipline in a factory then the workers become anxious and terrified 
Now I do not want to discuss discipline here that is not my point But I can put my point in this way if they have 
nothing to go by the workers become anxious and terrified Or to put it in another and more general way whenever 
we happen to be surrounded by either a natural environment or a social environment of which we know so little that 
we cannot predict what will happen then we all become anxious and terrified This is because if there is no possibility 
of our predicting what will happen in our environmentfor example how people will behavethen there is no 
possibility of reacting rationally Whether the environment in question is a natural or a social one is more or less 
irrelevant 

Discipline which was mentioned by Dr Brown may be one of the things which help people to find their way in a 
certain society but I am quite sure that Dr Brown will agree that it is only one of those things and that there are other 
things especially institutions and traditions which may give people a clear idea of what to expect and how to 
proceed I think this is very important What we call social life can exist only if we can know and can have 
confidence that there are things and events which must be so and cannot be otherwise 

It is here that the part played by tradition in our lives becomes understandable We should be anxious terrified and 
frustrated and we could not live in the social world did it not contain a considerable amount of order a great number 
of regularities to which we can adjust ourselves The mere existence of these regularities is perhaps more important 
than their peculiar merits or demerits They are needed as regularities and therefore handed on as traditions 
whether or not they are in other respects rational or necessary 

 

 

or good or beautiful or what you will There is a need for tradition in social life 

Thus the creation of traditions plays a role similar to that of theories Our scientific theories are instruments by which 
we try to bring some order into the chaos in which we live so as to make it rationally predictable I do not want you to 
take this as a deep philosophical pronouncement It is just a statement of one of the practical functions of our 
theories Similarly the creation of traditions like so much of our legislation has just that same function of bringing 
some order and rational predictability into the social world in which we live It is not possible for you to act rationally in 
the world if you have no idea how it will respond to your actions Every rational action assumes a certain system of 
reference which responds in a predictable or partly predictable way Just as the invention of myths or theories in the 
field of natural science has a functionthat of helping us to bring order into the events of natureso has the creation 
of traditions in the field of society 

The analogy between the role of myths or theories in science and the role of traditions in society goes further We 
must remember that the great significance of myths in scientific method was that they could become the objects of 
criticism and that they could be changed Similarly traditions have the important double function of not only creating a 
certain order or something like a social structure but also giving us something upon which we can operate 
something that we can criticize and change This point is decisive for us as rationalists and as social reformers Too 
many social reformers have an idea that they would like to clean the canvas as Plato called it of the social world 
wiping off everything and starting from scratch with a brandnew rational world This idea is nonsense and impossible 
to realize If you construct a rational world afresh there is no reason to believe that it will be a happy world There is 
no reason to believe that a blueprinted world will be any better than the world in which we live Why should it be any 
better An engineer does not create a motorengine just from the blueprints He develops it from earlier models he 
changes it he alters it over and over again If we wipe out the social world in which we live wipe out its traditions and 
create a new world on the basis of blueprints then we shall very soon have to alter the new world making little 
changes and adjustments But if we are to make these little changes and adjustments which will be needed in any 
case why not start them here and now in the social world we have It does not matter what you have and where you 
start You must always make little adjustments Since you will always have to make them it is very much more 
sensible and reasonable to start with what happens to exist at the moment because of these things which exist we at 
least know where the shoe pinches We at least know of certain things that they are bad and that we want them 
changed If we make our wonderful brave new world it will be quite a time before we find out what is wrong with it 
Moreover the idea of canvascleaning which is part of the wrong rationalist tradition is impossible because if the 
rationalist cleans the social canvas and wipes out the tradition 

 

 

he necessarily sweeps away with it himself and all his ideas and all his blueprints of the future The blueprints have 
no meaning in an empty social world in a social vacuum They have no meaning except in a setting of traditions and 
institutionssuch as myths poetry and valueswhich all emerge from the social world in which we live Outside it 
they have no meaning at all Therefore the very incentive and the very desire to build a new world must disappear 
once we have destroyed the traditions of the old world In science it would be a tremendous loss if we were to say 
We are not making very much progress Let us sweep away all science and start afresh The rational procedure is to 
correct it and to revolutionize it but not to sweep it away You may create a new theory but the new theory is created 
in order to solve those problems which the old theory did not solve 

We have briefly examined the function of tradition in social life What we found may now help us to answer the 
question how traditions arise how they are handed on and how they may become stereotypedall these being 
unintended consequences of human actions We can now understand why people not only try to learn the laws of 
their natural environment and to teach them to others often in the form of myth but why they also try to learn the 
traditions of their social environment We can now understand why people especially primitive peoples and children 
are inclined to cling to anything that may be or become a uniformity in their lives They cling to myths and they tend 
to cling to uniformities in their own behaviour first because they are afraid of irregularity and change and therefore 
afraid to originate irregularity and change and secondly because they wish to reassure others of their rationality or 
predictability perhaps in the hope of making them act in a similar way Thus they tend both to create traditions and to 
reaffirm those they find by carefully conforming to them and by anxiously insisting that others conform to them also 
This is how traditional taboos arise and how they are handed on 

This partly explains the strongly emotional intolerance which is characteristic of all traditionalism an intolerance 
against which rationalists have always and rightly stood out But we now see clearly that those rationalists who 
because of this tendency were led on to attack traditions as such were mistaken We can now say perhaps that 
what they really wanted was to replace the intolerance of the traditionalists by a new traditionthe tradition of 
tolerance and more generally to replace the attitude of tabooism by one that considers existing traditions critically 
weighing their merits against their demerits and never forgetting the merit which lies in the fact that they are 
established traditions For even if we ultimately reject them in order to replace them by better ones or by what we 
believe to be better ones we should always remain conscious of the fact that all social criticism and all social 
betterment must refer to a framework of social traditions of which some are criticized with the help of others just as 
all progress in science must proceed within a framework of scientific theories some of which are criticized in the light 
of others 

 

 

Much of what has been said here of traditions can also be said of institutions for traditions and institutions are in 
most respects strikingly similar Nevertheless it seems desirable although perhaps not very important to preserve 
the difference which can be found in the ordinary usage of these two words and I shall end my talk by trying to bring 
out the similarities and differences between these two kinds of social entity I do not think it is a good practice to 
distinguish the terms tradition and institution by formal definitions  but their use may be explained with the help of 
examples In fact I have done this already since I have mentioned schools a police force a grocers shop and the 
Stock Exchange as examples of social institutions and elsewhere such things as the burning interest in scientific 
research or the scientists critical attitude or the attitude of tolerance or the intolerance of the traditionalistor for 
that matter of the rationalistas examples of traditions Institutions and traditions have much in common among 
other things that they must be analysed by the social sciences in terms of individual persons their actions attitudes 
beliefs expectations and interrelations But we may say perhaps that we are inclined to speak of institutions 
wherever a changing body of people observe a certain set of norms or fulfil certain prima facie social functions 
such as teaching policing or selling groceries which serve certain prima facie social purposes such as the 
propagation of knowledge or protection from violence or starvation while we speak of traditions mainly when we 
wish to describe a uniformity of peoples attitudes or ways of behaviour or aims or values or tastes Thus traditions 
are perhaps more closely bound up with persons and their likes and dislikes their hopes and fears than are 
institutions They take as it were an intermediate place in social theory between persons and institutions We 
speak more naturally of a living tradition than of a living institution 

The difference in question may be made clearer by reference to what I have sometimes called the ambivalence of 
social institutions or the fact that a social institution may in certain circumstances function in a way which strikingly 
contrasts with its prima facie or proper function Of the perversion of boardingschools from their proper function 
Dickens had much to say and it has happened that a police force instead of protecting people from violence and 
blackmail has used threats of violence or of imprisonment in order to blackmail them Similarly the institution of a 
parliamentary Opposition one of whose prima facie functions is to prevent the government from stealing the 
taxpayers money has worked in certain countries in a different wayby becoming an instrument for the proportional 
division of the spoils The ambivalence of social institutions is connected with their characterwith the fact that they 
perform certain prima facie functions and with the fact that institutions can be controlled only by persons who are 
fallible or by other institutions which are therefore fallible also The ambivalence can undoubtedly be much reduced 
by carefully constructed institutional checks but it is impossible to eliminate it completely The working 

 

 For a criticism of this practice cf ch  of my book The Open Society and its Enemies 

 

 

of institutions as of fortresses depends ultimately upon the persons who man them and the best that can be done 
by way of institutional control is to give a superior chance to those persons if there are any who intend to use the 
institutions for their proper social purpose 

It is here that traditions may play an important role as intermediaries between persons and institutions Traditions to 
be sure may also be perverted something corresponding to the ambivalence here described affects them too But 
since their character is somewhat less instrumental than that of institutions they are less affected by this 
ambivalence On the other hand they are nearly as impersonal as institutionsless personal and more predictable 
than the individuals who man the institutions It may be said perhaps that the longterm proper functioning of 
institutions depends mainly upon such traditions It is tradition which gives the persons who come and go that 
background and that certainty of purpose which resist corruption A tradition is as it were capable of extending 
something of the personal attitude of its founder far beyond his personal life 

From the point of view of the most typical usages of the two terms it may be said that one of the connotations of the 
term tradition is an allusion to imitation as being either the origin of the tradition in question or the way it is 
handed on This connotation is I think absent from the term institution an institution may or may not have its origin 
in imitation and it may or may not continue its existence through imitation Moreover some of the things we call 
traditions may also be described as institutionsespecially as institutions of that sub society in which the tradition is 
generally followed Thus we might say that the rationalist tradition or the adoption of a critical attitude is institutional 
within the sub society of scientific workers or that the tradition of not kicking a man when he is down isalmosta 
British institution Similarly we may say that the English language though handed down by tradition is an institution 
while the practice of say avoiding split infinitives is a tradition though it may be institutional within a certain group 

Some of these points may be further exemplified by considering certain aspects of the social institution of language 
The main function of a language communication has been analysed by K Bhler into three functions  the 
expressive functionie the communication serves to express the emotions or thoughts of the speaker  the 
signalling or stimulative or release functionie the communication serves to stimulate or to release certain reactions 
in the hearer for example linguistic responses and  the descriptive functionie the communication describes a 
certain state of affairs These three functions are separable in so far as each is accompanied as a rule by its 
preceding one but need not be accompanied by its succeeding one The first two apply also to animal languages 
while the third appears to be characteristically human It is possible and I believe necessary to add a fourth to these 
three functions of Bhlers and one which is particularly 

 

 

important from our point of view viz  the argumentative or explanatory functionie the presentation and 
comparison of arguments or explanations in connection with certain definite questions or problems  A certain 
language may possess the first three functions without the fourth for example  that of a child at the stage when it 
just names things Now in so far as language qua institution has these functions it may be ambivalent For 
example it may be used by the speaker to hide his emotions or thoughts as much as to express them or to repress 
rather than to stimulate argument And there are different traditions connected with each one of these functions For 
example the different traditions of Italy and of England where we have the tradition of understatement in 
connection with the expressive function of the respective languages are very striking But all this becomes really 
important in connection with the two characteristically human functions of languagethe descriptive and 
argumentative functions In its descriptive function we may speak about language as a vehicle of truth but it may of 
course also become a vehicle of falsity Without a tradition which works against this ambivalence and in favour of 
the use of language for the purpose of correct description at least in all cases where there is no strong inducement 
to lie the descriptive function of language would perish for children would then never learn its descriptive use Even 
more precious perhaps is the tradition that works against the ambivalence connected with the argumentative function 
of language the tradition that works against that misuse of language which consists in pseudoarguments and 
propaganda This is the tradition and discipline of clear speaking and clear thinking it is the critical traditionthe 
tradition of reason 

The modern enemies of reason want to destroy this tradition They want to do this by destroying and perverting the 
argumentative and perhaps even the descriptive functions of the human language by a romantic reversion to its 
emotive functionsthe expressive there is too much talk about selfexpression and perhaps the signalling or 
stimulative function We see this tendency very clearly at work in certain types of modern poetry prose and 
philosophyin a philosophy which does not argue because it has no arguable problems These enemies of reason 
are sometimes antitraditionalists who seek new and impressive means of selfexpression or of communication and 
sometimes traditionalists who extol the wisdom of the linguistic tradition Both assume a theory of language that sees 
no more than the first or perhaps the second of its functions In their practice they support the flight from reason and 
from the great tradition of intellectual responsibility 

 

 Compare also ch  below The reason why I consider the argumentative and the explanatory functions as 
identical cannot be discussed here they are derived from a logical analysis of explanation and its relation 
to deduction or argument 
 An ordinary map is also an example of a description which is not argumentative although it may of course be 
used to support an argument within an argumentatwe language 

 

 

  
BACK TO THE PRESOCRATICS 
I 

BACK TO METHUSELAH was a progressive programme compared with Back to Thales or Back to Anaximander 
what Shaw offered us was an improved expectation of lifesomething that was in the air at any rate when he wrote 
it I have nothing to offer you I am afraid that is in the air today for what I want to return to is the simple 
straightforward rationality of the Presocratics Wherein does this much discussed rationality of the Presocratics 
lie The simplicity and boldness of their questions is part of it but my thesis is that the decisive point is the critical 
attitude which as I shall try to show was first developed in the Ionian School 

The questions which the Presocratics tried to answer were primarily cosmological questions but there were also 
questions of the theory of knowledge It is my belief that philosophy must return to cosmology and to a simple theory 
of knowledge There is at least one philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested the problem of 
understanding the world in which we live and thus ourselves who are part of that world and our knowledge of it All 
science is cosmology I believe and for me the interest of philosophy no less than of science lies solely in its bold 
attempt to add to our knowledge of the world and to the theory of our knowledge of the world I am interested in 
Wittgenstein for example not because of his linguistic philosophy but because his Tractatus was a cosmological 
treatise although a crude one and because his theory of knowledge was closely linked with his cosmology 

For me both philosophy and science lose all their attraction when they give up that pursuitwhen they become 
specialisms and cease to see and to wonder at the riddles of our world Specialization may be a great temptation for 
the scientist For the philosopher it is the mortal sin 

 

The Presidential Address delivered before the meeting of the Aristotelian Society on th 
October  first published in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society NS   
The footnotes and the Appendix have been added in the present reprint of the address 

 

 

In this paper I speak as an amateur as a lover of the beautiful story of the Presocratics I am not a specialist or an 
expert I am completely out of my depth when an expert begins to argue which words or phrases Heraclitus might 
and which he could not possibly have used Yet when some expert replaces a beautiful story based on the oldest 
texts we possess by one which to me at any rateno longer makes any sense then I feel that even an amateur 
may stand up and defend an old tradition Thus I will at least look into the experts arguments and examine their 
consistency This seems a harmless occupation to indulge in and if an expert or anybody else should take the 
trouble to refute my criticism I shall be pleased and honoured  

I shall be concerned with the cosmological theories of the Presocratics but only to the extent to which they bear upon 
the development of the problem of change as I call it and only to the extent to which they are needed for 
understanding the approach of the Presocratic philosophers to the problem of knowledgetheir practical as well as 
their theoretical approach For it is of considerable interest to see how their practice as well as their theory of 
knowledge is connected with the cosmological and theological questions which they posed to themselves Theirs was 
not a theory of knowledge that began with the question How do I know that this is an orange or How do I know 
that the object I am now perceiving is an orange Their theory of knowledge started from problems such as How do 
we know that the world is made of water or How do we know that the world is full of gods or How can we know 
anything about the gods 

There is a widespread belief somewhat remotely due I think to the influence of Francis Bacon that one should 
study the problems of the theory of knowledge in connection with our knowledge of an orange rather than our 
knowledge of the cosmos I dissent from this belief and it is one of the main purposes of my paper to convey to you 
some of my reasons for dissenting At any rate it is good to remember from time to time that our Western science 
and there seems to be no otherdid not start with collecting observations of oranges but with bold theories about the 
world 

Traditional empiricist epistemology and the traditional historiography of science are both deeply influenced by the 
Baconian myth that all science starts from observation and then slowly and cautiously proceeds to theories That the 
facts are very different can be learned from studying the early Preso cratics Here we find bold and fascinating ideas 
some of which are strange and even staggering anticipations of modern results while many others are wide of the 
mark from our modern point of view but most of them and the best of them have nothing to do with observation 
Take for example some of the theories about the shape and position of the earth Thales said we are 

 

 I am glad to be able to report that Mr G S Kirk has indeed replied to my address see below notes  and  and 
the Appendix to this paper 

 

 

told that the earth is supported by water on which it rides like a ship and when we say that there is an earthquake 
then the earth is being shaken by the movement of the water No doubt Thales had observed earthquakes as well as 
the rolling of a ship before he arrived at his theory But the point of his theory was to explain the support or 
suspension of the earth and also earthquakes by the conjecture that the earth floats on water and for this 
conjecture which so strangely anticipates the modern theory of continental drift he could have no basis in his 
observations 

We must not forget that the function of the Baconian myth is to explain why scientific statements are true by pointing 
out that observation is the true source of our scientific knowledge Once we realize that all scientific statements 
are hypotheses or guesses or conjectures and that the vast majority of these conjectures including Bacons own 
have turned out to be false the Baconian myth becomes irrelevant For it is pointless to argue that the conjectures of 
sciencethose which have proved to be false as well as those which are still acceptedall start from observation 

However this may be Thales beautiful theory of the support or suspension of the earth and of earthquakes though in 
no sense based upon observation is at least inspired by an empirical or observational analogy But even this is no 
longer true of the theory proposed by Thales great pupil Anaximander Anaximanders theory of the suspension of 
the earth is still highly intuitive but it no longer uses observational analogies In fact it may be described as counter
observational According to Anaximanders theory The earth    is held up by nothing but remains stationary owing 
to the fact that it is equally distant from all other things Its shape is    like that of a drum    We walk on one of its 
flat surfaces while the other is on the opposite side The drum of course is an observational analogy But the idea 
of the earths free suspension in space and the explanation of its stability have no analogy whatever in the whole 
field of observable facts 

In my opinion this idea of Anaximanders is one of the boldest most revolutionary and most portentous ideas in the 
whole history of human thought It made possible the theories of Aristarchus and Copernicus But the step taken by 
Anaximander was even more difficult and audacious than the one taken by Aristarchus and Copernicus To envisage 
the earth as freely poised in midspace and to say that it remains motionless because of its equidistance or 
equilibrium as Aristotle paraphrases Anaximander is to anticipate to some extent even Newtons idea of immaterial 
and invisible gravitational forces  

 

 Aristotle himself understood Anaximander in this way for he caricatures Anaximanders ingenious but untrue 
theory by comparing the situation of its earth to that of a man who being equally hungry and thirsty yet 
equidistant from food and drink is unable to move  De Caelo b It is the idea which has become known by 
the misleading name of  Buridans ass It is quite clear that Aristotle conceives this man as kept in equilibrium by 
immaterial and invisible attractive forces similar to Newtonian forces and it is interesting that this animistic or 
occult character of his forces was deeply felt by Newton himself and by his opponents such as Berkeley to be a 
blot on his theory 

 

 

How did Anaximander arrive at this remarkable theory Certainly not by observation but by reasoning His theory is 
an attempt to solve one of the problems to which his teacher and kinsman Thales the founder of the Milesian or 
Ionian School had offered a solution before him I therefore conjecture that Anaximander arrived at his theory by 
criticizing Thales theory This conjecture can be supported I believe by a consideration of the structure of 
Anaximanders theory 

Anaximander is likely to have argued against Thales theory according to which the earth was floating on water on 
the following lines Thales theory is a specimen of a type of theory which if consistently developed would lead to an 
infinite regress If we explain the stable position of the earth by the assumption that it is supported by waterthat it is 
floating on the ocean Okeanosshould we not have to explain the stable position of the ocean by an analogous 
hypothesis But this would mean looking for a support for the ocean and then for a support for this support This 
method of explanation is unsatisfactory first because we solve our problem by creating an exactly analogous one 
and also for the less formal and more intuitive reason that in any such system of supports or props failure to secure 
any one of the lower props must lead to the collapse of the whole edifice 

From this we see intuitively that the stability of the world cannot be secured by a system of supports or props Instead 
Anaximander appeals to the internal or structural symmetry of the world which ensures that there is no preferred 
direction in which a collapse can take place He applies the principle that where there are no differences there can be 
no change In this way he explains the stability of the earth by the equality of its distances from all other things 

This it seems was Anaximanders argument It is important to realize that it abolishes even though not quite 
consciously perhaps and not quite consistently the idea of an absolute directionthe absolute sense of up wards 
and downwards This is not only contrary to all experience but notoriously difficult to grasp Anaximenes ignored it it 
seems and even Anaximander himself did not grasp it completely For the idea of an equal distance from all other 
things should have led him to the theory that the earth has the shape of a globe Instead he believed that it had the 
shape of a drum with an upper and a lower flat surface Yet it looks as if the remark We walk on one of its flat 
surfaces while the other is on the opposite side contained a hint that there was no absolute upper surface but that 
on the contrary the surface on which we happened to walk was the one we might call the upper 

What prevented Anaximander from arriving at the theory that the earth was a globe rather than a drum There can be 
little doubt it was observational experience which taught him that the surface of the earth was by and large 
flat Thus it was a speculative and critical argument the abstract critical discussion of Thales theory which almost 
led him to the true theory of the shape of the earth and it was observational experience which led him astray 

 

 

There is an obvious objection to Anaximanders theory of symmetry according to which the earth is equally distant 
from all other things The asymmetry of the universe can be easily seen from the existence of sun and moon and 
especially from the fact that sun and moon are sometimes not far distant from each other so that they are on the 
same side of the earth while there is nothing on the other side to balance them It appears that Anaximander met this 
objection by another bold theoryhis theory of the hidden nature of the sun the moon and the other heavenly 
bodies 

He envisages the rims of two huge chariot wheels rotating round the earth one  times the size of the earth the 
other  times its size Each of these rims or circular pipes is filled with fire and each has a breathinghole through 
which the fire is visible These holes we call the sun and the moon respectively The rest of the wheel is invisible 
presumably because it is dark or misty and far away The fixed stars and presumably the planets are also holes on 
wheels which are nearer to the earth than the wheels of the sun and the moon The wheels of the fixed stars rotate 
on a common axis which we now call the axis of the earth and together they form a sphere round the earth in 
accordance with the postulate that all things are positioned at similar distances from the earth In this way 
Anaximander also became the founder of the theory of spheres 

There can be no doubt whatever that Anaximanders theories are critical and speculative rather than empirical and 
considered as approaches to truth his critical and abstract speculations served him better than observational 
experience or analogy 

But a follower of Bacon may reply this is precisely why Anaximander was not a scientist This is precisely why we 
speak of early Greek philosophy rather than of early Greek science Philosophy is speculative everybody knows 
this And as everybody knows science begins only when the speculative method is replaced by the observational 
method and when deduction is replaced by induction 

This reply of course amounts to the thesis that scientific theories should be defined by reference to their origintheir 
origin in observations or in socalled inductive procedures Yet I believe that few if any physical theories would fall 
under this definition And I do not see why the question of origin should be important in this connection What is 
important about a theory is its explanatory power and whether it stands up to criticism and to tests The question of 
its origin of how it is arrived atwhether by an inductive procedure as some say or by an act of intuitionmay be 
extremely interesting especially for the biographer of the man who invented the theory but it has little to do with its 
scientific status or character 

 

 

As to the Presocratics I assert that there is the most perfect possible continuity of thought between their theories and 
the later developments in physics Whether they are called philosophers or prescientists or scientists matters very 
little I think But I do assert that Anaximanders theory cleared the way for the theories of Aristarchus Copernicus 
Kepler and Galileo It is not that he merely influenced these later thinkers influence is a very superficial category I 
would rather put it like this Anaximanders achievement is valuable in itself like a work of art Besides his 
achievement made other achievements possible among them those of the great scientists mentioned 

But are not Anaximanders theories false and therefore nonscientific They are false I admit but so are many 
theories based upon countless experiments which modern science accepted until recently and whose scientific 
character nobody would dream of denying even though they are now believed to be false An example is the theory 
that the typical chemical properties of hydrogen belong only to one kind of atomthe lightest of all atoms There were 
historians of science who tended to regard as unscientific or even as superstitious any view no longer accepted at 
the time they were writing but this is an untenable attitude A false theory may be as great an achievement as a true 
one And many false theories have been more helpful in our search for truth than some less interesting theories 
which are still accepted For false theories can be helpful in many ways they may for example suggest some more or 
less radical modifications and they may stimulate criticism Thus Thales theory that the earth floats on water 
reappeared in a modified form in Anaximenes and in more recent times in the form of Wegeners theory of 
continental drift How Thales theory stimulated Anaximanders criticism has been shown already 

Anaximanders theory similarly suggested a modified theorythe theory of an earth globe freely poised in the centre 
of the universe and surrounded by spheres on which heavenly bodies were mounted And by stimulating criticism it 
also led to the theory that the moon shines by reflecting light to the Pythagorean theory of a central fire and 
ultimately to the heliocentric worldsystem of Aristarchus and Copernicus 

VIII 

I believe that the Milesians like their oriental predecessors who took the world for a tent envisaged the world as a 
kind of house the home of all creaturesour home Thus there was no need to ask what it was for But there was a 
real need to inquire into its architecture The questions of its structure its groundplan and its building material 
constitute the three main problems of Milesian cosmology There is also a speculative interest in its origin the 
question of cosmology It seems to me that the cosmological interest of the Milesians far exceeded their 
cosmogonical interest especially if we consider 

 

 

the strong cosmogonical tradition and the almost irresistible tendency to describe a thing by describing how it has 
been made and thus to present a cosmological account in a cosmogonical form The cosmological interest must be 
very strong as compared with the cosmogonical one if the presentation of a cosmological theory is even partially 
free from these cosmogonical trappings 

I believe that it was Thales who first discussed the architecture of the cosmosits structure groundplan and building 
material In Anaximander we find answers to all three questions I have briefly mentioned his answer to the question 
of structure As to the question of the groundplan of the world he studied and expounded this too as indicated by 
the tradition that he drew the first map of the world And of course he had a theory about its building materialthe 
endless or boundless or unbounded or unformedthe apeiron 

In Anaximanders world all kinds of changes were going on There was a fire which needed air and breathingholes 
and these were at times blocked up obstructed so that the fire was smothered  this was his theory of eclipses 
and of the phases of the moon There were winds which were responsible for the changing weather  And there 
were the vapours resulting from the drying up of water and air which were the cause of the winds and of the 
turnings of the sun the solstices and of the moon 

We have here the first hint of what was soon to come of the general problem of change which became the 
central problem of Greek cosmology and which ultimately led with Leucippus and Democritus to a general 
theory of change that was accepted by modern science almost up to the beginning of the twentieth century It 
was given up only with the breakdown of Maxwells models of the ether an historic event that was little noticed before 
 

This general problem of change is a philosophical problem indeed in the hands of Parmenides and Zeno it 
almost turns into a logical one How is change possiblelogically possible that is How can a thing change 
without losing its identity If it remains the same it does not change yet if it loses its identity then it is no longer that 
thing which has changed 

 

 I do not suggest that the smothering is due to blocking breathingin holes according to the phlogiston theory for 
example fire is smothered by obstructing breathingout holes But I do not wish to ascribe to Anaximander either 
a phlogiston theory of combustion or an anticipation of Lavoisier 
 In my address as it was originally published I continued here and indeed for all other changes within the cosmic 
edifice relying on Zeller who wrote appealing to the testimony of Aristotles   Anaximander it seems explained 
the motion of the heavenly bodies by the currents of the air which are responsible for the turning of the stellar 
spheres  th edn   p  see also p  n  Heath   p  and Lee edition of the   p 
 But I should perhaps not have interpreted Zellers currents of air as winds especially as Zeller should 
have said vapours they are evaporations resulting from a process of drying up I have twice inserted vapours 
and before winds and almost before all in the second paragraph of section ix and I have replaced in the third 
paragraph of section ix winds by vapours I have made these changes in the hope of meeting Mr G S Kirks 
criticism on p  of his article discussed in the appendix to the present chapter 

 

 

IX 

The exciting story of the development of the problem of change appears to me in danger of being completely buried 
under the mounting heap of the minutiae of textual criticism The story cannot of course be fully told in one short 
paper and still less in one of its many sections But in briefest outline it is this 

For Anaximander our own world our own cosmic edifice was only one of an infinity of worldsan infinity without 
bounds in space and time This system of worlds was eternal and so was motion There was thus no need to explain 
motion no need to offer a general theory of change in the sense in which we shall find a general problem and a 
general theory of change in Heraclitus see below But there was a need to explain the wellknown changes 
occurring in our world The most obvious changesthe change of day and night of winds and of weather of the 
seasons from sowing to harvesting and of the growth of plants and animals and menall were connected with the 
contrast of temperatures with the opposition between the hot and the cold and with that between the dry and the 
wet Living creatures came into being from moisture evaporated by the sun we are told and the hot and the cold 
also administer to the genesis of our own world edifice The hot and the cold were also responsible for the vapours 
and winds which in their turn were conceived as the agents of almost all other changes 

Anaximenes a pupil of Anaximander and his successor developed these ideas in much detail Like Anaximander he 
was interested in the oppositions of the hot and the cold and of the moist and the dry and he explained the 
transitions between these opposites by a theory of condensation and rarefaction Like Anaximander he believed in 
eternal motion and in the action of the winds and it seems not unlikely that one of the two main points in which he 
deviated from Anaximander was reached by a criticism of the idea that what was completely boundless and formless 
the apeiron could yet be in motion At any rate he replaced the apeiron by airsomething that was almost 
boundless and formless and yet according to Anaximanders old theory of vapours not only capable of motion but 
the main agent of motion and change A similar unification of ideas was achieved by Anaximenes theory that the sun 
consists of earth and that it gets very hot owing to the rapidity of its motion The replacement of the more abstract 
theory of the unbounded apeiron by the less abstract and more commonsense theory of air is matched by the 
replacement of Anaximanders bold theory of the stability of the earth by the more commonsense idea that the 
earths flatness is responsible for its stability for itcovers like a lid the air beneath it Thus the earth rides on air as 
the lid of a pot may ride on steam or as a ship may ride on water Thales question and Thales answer are both re
instituted and Anaximanders epochmaking argument is not understood Anaximenes is an eclectic a systematizer 
an empiricist a man of common sense Of the three great Milesians he is least productive of revolutionary new ideas 
he is the least philosophically minded 

 

 

The three Milesians all looked on our world as our home There was movement there was change in this home there 
was hot and cold fire and moisture There was a fire in the hearth and on it a kettle with water The house was 
exposed to the winds and a bit draughty to be sure but it was home and it meant security and stability of a sort But 
for Heraclitus the house was on fire 

There was no stability left in the world of Heraclitus Everything is in flux and nothing is at rest Everything is in 
flux even the beams the timber the building material of which the world is made earth and rocks or the bronze of a 
cauldronthey are all in flux The beams are rotting the earth is washed away and blown away the very rocks split 
and wither the bronze cauldron turns into green patina or into verdigris All things are in motion all the time even 
thoughthis escapes our senses as Aristotle expressed it Those who do not know and do not think believe that 
only the fuel is burned while the bowl in which it burns cp DK A  remains unchanged for we do not see the bowl 
burning And yet it burns it is eaten up by the fire it holds We do not see our children grow up and change and 
grow old but they do 

Thus there are no solid bodies Things are not really things they are processes they are in flux They are like fire 
like a flame which though it may have a definite shape is a process a stream of matter a river All things are flames 
fire is the very building material of our world and the apparent stability of things is merely due to the laws the 
measures which the processes in our world are subject to 

This I believe is Heraclitus story it is his message the true word the logos to which we ought to listen 
Listening not to me but to the true account it is wise to admit that all things are one they are an everlasting fire 
flaring up in measures and dying down in measures 

I know very well that the traditional interpretation of Heraclitus philosophy here restated is not generally accepted at 
present But the critics have put nothing in its placenothing that is of philosophical interest I shall briefly discuss 
their new interpretation in the next section Here I wish only to stress that Heraclitus philosophy by appealing to 
thought to the word to argument to reason and by pointing out that we are living in a world of things whose 
changes escape our senses though we know that they do change created two new problemsthe problem of 
change and the problem of knowledge These problems were the more urgent as his own account of change 
was difficult to understand But this I believe is due to the fact that he saw more clearly than his predecessors the 
difficulties that were involved in the very idea of change 

For all change is the change of something change presupposes something that changes And it presupposes that 
while changing this something must remain the same We may say that a green leaf changes when it turns brown 
but we do not say that the green leaf changes when we substitute for it a brown leaf It is essential to the idea of 
change that the thing which changes retains its identity while changing And yet it must become something else 

 

 

it was green and it becomes brown it was moist and it becomes dry it was hot and it becomes cold 

Thus every change is the transition of a thing into something with in a way opposite qualities as Anaximander and 
Anaximenes had seen And yet while changing the changing thing must remain identical with itself 

This is the problem of change It led Heraclitus to a theory which partly anticipating Parmenides distinguishes 
between reality and appearance The real nature of things loves to hide itself An unapparent harmony is stronger 
than the apparent one Things are in appearance and for us opposites but in truth and for God they are the 
same 

Life and death being awake and being asleep youth and old age all these are the samefor the 
one turned round is the other and the other turned round is the first The path that leads up and the 
path that leads down are the same path Good and bad are identical For God all things are 
beautiful and good and just but men assume some things to be unjust and others to be just It is 
not in the nature or character of man to possess true knowledge though it is in the divine nature 

Thus in truth and for God the opposites are identical it is only to man that they appear as nonidentical And all 
things are onethey are all part of the process of the world the everlasting fire 

This theory of change appeals to the true word to the logos to reason nothing is more real for Heraclitus than 
change Yet his doctrine of the oneness of the world of the identity of opposites and of appearance and reality 
threatens his doctrine of the reality of change 

For change is the transition from one opposite to the other Thus if in truth the opposites are identical though they 
appear different then change itself might be only apparent If in truth and for God all things are one there might in 
truth be no change 

This consequence was drawn by Parmenides the pupil pace Burnet and others of the monotheist Xenophanes who 
said of the one God He always remains in the same place never moving It is not fitting that He should go to 
different places at different timesHe is in no way similar to mortal men neither in body nor in thought 

Xenophanes pupil Parmenides taught that the real world was one and that it always remained in the same place 
never moving It was not fitting that it should go to different places at different times It was in no way similar to what 
it appeared to be to mortal men The world was one an undivided whole without parts homogeneous and 
motionless motion was impossible in such a world In truth there was no change The world of change was an 
illusion 

Parmenides based this theory of an unchanging reality on something like a logical proof a proof which can be 
presented as proceeding from the single premiss What is not is not From this we can derive that the nothingthat 
which is notdoes not exist a result which Parmenides interprets to mean that the void does not exist Thus the world 
is full it consists of one 

 

 

undivided block since any division into parts could only be due to separation of the parts by the void This is the well
rounded truth which the goddess revealed to Parmenides In this full world there is no room for motion 

Only the delusive belief in the reality of oppositesthe belief that not only what is exists but also what is notleads 
to the illusion of a world of change 

Parmenides theory may be described as the first hypotheticodeductive theory of the world The atomists took it as 
such and they asserted that it was refuted by experience since motion does exist Accepting the formal validity of 
Parmenides argument they inferred from the falsity of his conclusion the falsity of his premiss But this meant that 
the nothingthe void or empty spaceexisted Consequently there was now no need to assume that what isthe 
full that which fills some spacehad no parts for its parts could now be separated by the void Thus there are many 
parts each of which is full there are full particles in the world separated by empty space and able to move in empty 
space each of them being full undivided indivisible and unchanging Thus what exists is atoms and the void 
In this way the atomists arrived at a theory of changea theory that dominated scientific thought until  It is 
the theory that all change and especially all qualitative change has to be explained by the spatial 
movement of unchanging bits of matterby atoms moving in the void 

The next great step in our cosmology and the theory of change was made when Maxwell developing certain ideas of 
Faradays replaced this theory by a theory of changing intensities of fields 

X 

I have sketched the story as I see it of the Presocratic theory of change I am of course well aware of the fact that 
my story which is based on Plato Aristotle and the doxographic tradition clashes at many points with the views of 
some experts English as well as German and especially with the views expressed by G S Kirk and J E Raven in 
their book   I cannot of course examine their arguments in detail here and especially not their minute 
exegeses of various passages some of which are relevant to the differences between their interpretation and mine 
See for example Kirk and Ravens discussion of the question whether there is a reference to Heraclitus in 
Parmenides cf their note  on pp  f and note  on p  But I wish to say that I have examined their 
arguments and that I have found them unconvincing and often quite unacceptable 

I will mention here only some points regarding Heraclitus although there are other points of equal importance such 
as their comments on Parmenides 

The traditional view according to which Heraclitus central doctrine was that all things are in flux was attacked forty 
years ago by Burnet His main argument discussed by me at length in note  to ch  of my Open Society was 
that the theory of change was not new and that only a new message could explain the urgency with which Heraclitus 
speaks This argument is repeated by Kirk and Raven when they write pp  f But all Presocratic 

 

 

thinkers were struck by the predominance of change in the world of our experience About this attitude I said in my 
Open Society Those who suggestthat the doctrine of universal flux was not neware I feel unconscious 
witnesses to Heraclitus originality for they fail now after  years to grasp his main point In brief they do not 
see the difference between the Milesian message There is a fire in the house and Heraclitus somewhat more 
urgent message The house is on fire An implicit reply to this criticism can be found on p  of the book by Kirk 
and Raven where they write Can Heraclitus really have thought that a rock or a bronze cauldron for example was 
invariably undergoing invisible changes of material Perhaps so but nothing in the extant fragments suggests that he 
did But is this so Heraclitus extant fragments about the fire  Kirk and Raven fragm  are interpreted by Kirk 
and Raven themselves as follows p   Fire is the archetypal form of matter Now I am not at all sure what 
archetypal means here especially in view of the fact that we read a few lines later Cosmogonyis not to be found 
in Heraclitus But whatever archetypal may mean it is clear that once it is admitted that Heraclitus says in the 
extant fragments that all matter is somehow whether archetypally or otherwise fire he also says that all matter like 
fire is a process which is precisely the theory denied to Heraclitus by Kirk and Raven 

Immediately after saying that nothing in the extant fragments suggests that Heraclitus believed in continuous 
invisible changes Kirk and Raven make the following methodological remark It cannot be too strongly emphasized 
that before Parmenides and his apparent proof that the senses were completely fallaciousgross departures from 
common sense must only be accepted when the evidence for them is extremely strong This is intended to mean that 
the doctrine that bodies of any substance constantly undergo invisible changes represents a gross departure from 
common sense a departure which one ought not to expect in Heraclitus 

But to quote Heraclitus He who does not expect the unexpected will not detect it for him it will remain undetectable 
and unapproachable DK B  In fact Kirk and Ravens last argument is invalid on many grounds Long before 
Parmenides we find ideas far removed from common sense in Anaximander Pythagoras Xenophanes and 
especially in Heraclitus Indeed the suggestion that we should test the historicity of the ideas ascribed to Heraclitus  
as we might indeed test the historicity of those ascribed to Anaximenes by standards of common sense is a little 
surprising whatever common sense may mean here For this suggestion runs counter not only to Heraclitus 
notorious obscurity and oracular style confirmed by Kirk and Raven but also to his burning interest in antinomy and 
paradox And it runs counter last but not least to the in my view quite absurd doctrine which Kirk and Raven finally 
attribute to Heraclitus the italics are mine that natural changes of all kinds and thus presumably also 
earthquakes and great fires are regular and balanced and that the cause of this balance is fire the 
common constituent of things that was also termed theirLogos But why I ask should 

 

 

fire be the cause of any balanceeither this balance or any other And where does Heraclitus say such things 
Indeed had this been Heraclitus philosophy then I could see no reason to take any interest in it at any rate it would 
be much further removed from common sense as I see it than the inspired philosophy which tradition ascribes to 
Heraclitus and which in the name of common sense is rejected by Kirk and Raven 

But the decisive point is of course that this inspired philosophy is true for all we know  With his uncanny intuition 
Heraclitus saw that things are processes that our bodies are flames that a rock or a bronze cauldron was 
invariably undergoing invisible changes Kirk and Raven say p  note  the argument reads like an answer to 
Melissus Every time the finger rubs it rubs off an invisible portion of iron yet when it does not rub what reason is 
there to think that the iron is still changing The reason is that the wind rubs and that there is always wind or that 
iron turns invisibly into rust  by oxidation and this means by slow burning or that old iron looks different from new 
iron just as an old man looks different from a child cp DK B  This was Heraclitus teaching as the extant 
fragments show 

I suggest that Kirk and Ravens methodological principle that gross departures from common sense must only be 
accepted when the evidence for them is extremely strong might well be replaced by the clearer and more important 
principle that gross departures from the historical tradition must only be accepted when the 
evidence for them is extremely strong This in fact is a universal principle of historiography Without it history 
would be impossible Yet it is constantly violated by Kirk and Raven when for example they try to make Platos and 
Aristotles evidence suspect with arguments which are partly circular and partly like the one from common sense in 
contradiction to their own story And when they say that little serious attempt seems to have been made by Plato and 
Aristotle to penetrate his ie Heraclitus real meaning then I can only say that the philosophy outlined by Plato and 
Aristotle seems to me a philosophy that has real meaning and real depth It is a philosophy worthy of a great 
philosopher Who if not Heraclitus was the great thinker who first realized that men are flames and that things are 
processes Are we really to believe that this great philosophy was a postHeraclitean exaggeration p   and 
that it may have been suggested to Plato in particular perhaps by Cratylus Who I ask was this unknown 
philosopherperhaps the greatest and the boldest thinker among the Presocratics Who was he if not Heraclitus

The early history of Greek philosophy especially the history from Thales to 

 

 This should establish that it makes sense at any rate I hope it is clear from the text that I appeal to truth here in 
order a to make clear that my interpretation at least makes sense and b to refute the arguments of Kirk and 
Raven discussed later in this paragraph that the theory is absurd An answer to G S Kirk which was too long to 
be appended here although it refers to the present passage and to the present paragraph will be found in the 
Appendix at the end of this paper 

 

 

Plato is a splendid story It is almost too good to be true In every generation we find at least one new philosophy 
one new cosmology of staggering originality and depth How was this possible Of course one cannot explain 
originality and genius But one can try to throw some light on them What was the secret of the ancients I suggest 
that it was a traditionthe tradition of critical discussion 

I will try to put the problem more sharply In all or almost all civilizations we find something like religious and 
cosmological teaching and in many societies we find schools Now schools especially primitive schools all have it 
appears a characteristic structure and function Far from being places of critical discussion they make it their task to 
impart a definite doctrine and to preserve it pure and unchanged It is the task of a school to hand on the tradition 
the doctrine of its founder its first master to the next generation and to this end the most important thing is to keep 
the doctrine inviolate A school of this kind never admits a new idea New ideas are heresies and lead to schisms 
should a member of the school try to change the doctrine then he is expelled as a heretic But the heretic claims as 
a rule that his is the true doctrine of the founder Thus not even the inventor admits that he has introduced an 
invention he believes rather that he is returning to the true orthodoxy which has somehow been perverted 

In this way all changes of doctrineif anyare surreptitious changes They are all presented as restatements of the 
true sayings of the master of his own words his own meaning his own intentions 

It is clear that in a school of this kind we cannot expect to find a history of ideas or even the material for such a 
history For new ideas are not admitted to be new Everything is ascribed to the master All we might reconstruct is a 
history of schisms and perhaps a history of the defence of certain doctrines against the heretics 

There cannot of course be any rational discussion in a school of this kind There may be arguments against 
dissenters and heretics or against some competing schools But in the main it is with assertion and dogma and 
condemnation rather than argument that the doctrine is defended 

The great example of a school of this kind among the Greek philosophical schools is the Italian School founded by 
Pythagoras Compared with the Ionian school or with that of Elea it had the character of a religious order with a 
characteristic way of life and a secret doctrine The story that a member Hippasus of Metapontum was drowned at 
sea because he revealed the secret of the irrationality of certain square roots is characteristic of the atmosphere 
surrounding the Pythagorean school whether or not there is any truth in this story 

But among Greek philosophic schools the early Pythagoreans were an exception Leaving them aside we could say 
that the character of Greek Philosophy and of the philosophical schools is strikingly different from the dogmatic type 
of school here described I have shown this by an example the story of the problem of change which I 
have told is the story of a critical 

 

 

debate of a rational discussion New ideas are propounded as such and arise as the result of open criticism 
There are few if any surreptitious changes Instead of anonymity we find a history of ideas and of their originators 

Here is a unique phenomenon and it is closely connected with the astonishing freedom and creativeness of Greek 
philosophy How can we explain this phenomenon What we have to explain is the rise of a tradition It is a 
tradition that allows or encourages critical discussions between various schools and more surprisingly still within one 
and the same school For nowhere outside the Pythagorean school do we find a school devoted to the preservation 
of a doctrine Instead we find changes new ideas modifications and outright criticism of the master 

In Parmenides we even find at an early date a most remarkable phenomenonthat of a philosopher who propounds 
two doctrines one which he says is true and one which he himself describes as false Yet he makes the false 
doctrine not simply an object of condemnation or of criticism rather he presents it as the best possible account of the 
delusive opinion of mortal men and of the world of mere appearancethe best account which a mortal man can 
give 

How and where was this critical tradition founded This is a problem deserving serious thought This much is certain 
Xenophanes who brought the Ionian tradition to Elea was fully conscious of the fact that his own teaching was purely 
conjectural and that others might come who would know better I shall come back to this point again in my next and 
last section 

If we look for the first signs of this new critical attitude this new freedom of thought we are led back to 
Anaximanders criticism of Thales Here is a most striking fact Anaximander criticizes his master and kinsman one of 
the Seven Sages the founder of the Ionian school He was according to tradition only about fourteen years younger 
than Thales and he must have developed his criticism and his new ideas while his master was alive They seem to 
have died within a few years of each other But there is no trace in the sources of a story of dissent of any quarrel 
or of any schism 

This suggests I think that it was Thales who founded the new tradition of freedombased upon a new relation 
between master and pupiland who thus created a new type of school utterly different from the Pythagorean school 
He seems to have been able to tolerate criticism And what is more he seems to have created the tradition that one 
ought to tolerate criticism 

Yet I like to think that he did even more than this I can hardly imagine a relationship between master and pupil in 
which the master merely tolerates criticism without actively encouraging it It does not seem to me possible that a 
pupil who is being trained in the dogmatic attitude would ever dare to criticize the dogma least of all that of a famous 
sage and to voice his criticism And it seems to me an easier and simpler explanation to assume that the master 
encouraged a critical attitudepossibly not from the outset but only after he was struck by the pertinence of some 
questions asked without any critical intention by the pupil 

 

 

However this may be the conjecture that Thales actively encouraged criticism in his pupils would explain the fact that 
the critical attitude towards the masters doctrine became part of the Ionian school tradition I like to think that Thales 
was the first teacher who said to his pupils This is how I see thingshow I believe that things are Try to improve 
upon my teaching Those who believe that it is unhistorical to attribute this undogmatic attitude to Thales may again 
be reminded of the fact that only two generations later we find a similar attitude consciously and clearly formulated in 
the fragments of Xenophanes At any rate there is the historical fact that the Ionian school was the first in which 
pupils criticized their masters in one generation after the other There can be little doubt that the Greek tradition of 
philosophical criticism had its main source in Ionia 

It was a momentous innovation It meant a break with the dogmatic tradition which permits only one school doctrine 
and the introduction in its place of a tradition that admits a plurality of doctrines which all try to approach the truth by 
means of critical discussion 

It thus leads almost by necessity to the realization that our attempts to see and to find the truth are not final but 
open to improvement that our knowledge our doctrine is conjectural that it consists of guesses of hypotheses 
rather than of final and certain truths and that criticism and critical discussion are our only means of getting nearer to 
the truth It thus leads to the tradition of bold conjectures and of free criticism the tradition which created the rational 
or scientific attitude and with it our Western civilization the only civilization which is based upon science though of 
course not upon science alone 

In this rationalist tradition bold changes of doctrine are not forbidden On the contrary innovation is encouraged and 
is regarded as success as improvement if it is based on the result of a critical discussion of its predecessors The 
very boldness of an innovation is admired for it can be controlled by the severity of its critical examination This is 
why changes of doctrine far from being made surreptitiously are traditionally handed down together with the older 
doctrines and the names of the innovators And the material for a history of ideas becomes part of the school 
tradition 

To my knowledge the critical or rationalist tradition was invented only once It was lost after two or three centuries 
perhaps owing to the rise of the Aristotelian doctrine of epistm of certain and demonstrable knowledge a 
development of the Eleatic and Heraclitean distinction between certain truth and mere guesswork It was 
rediscovered and consciously revived by the Renaissance especially by Galileo Galilei 

XII 

I now come to my last and most central contention It is this The rationalist tradition the tradition of critical 
discussion represents the only practicable way of expanding our knowledgeconjectural or hypothetical knowledge 
of course There is no other way More especially there is no way that starts 

 

 

from observation or experiment In the development of science observations and experiments play only the role of 
critical arguments And they play this role alongside other nonobservational arguments It is an important role but 
the significance of observations and experiments depends entirely upon the question whether or not they may be 
used to criticize theories 

According to the theory of knowledge here outlined there are in the main only two ways in which theories may be 
superior to others they may explain more and they may be better testedthat is they may be more fully and more 
critically discussed in the light of all we know of all the objections we can think of and especially also in the light of 
observational or experimental tests which were designed with the aim of criticizing the theory 

There is only one element of rationality in our attempts to know the world it is the critical examination of our theories 
These theories themselves are guesswork We do not know we only guess If you ask me How do you know my 
reply would be I dont I only propose a guess If you are interested in my problem I shall be most happy if you 
criticize my guess and if you offer counterproposals I in turn will try to criticize them 

This I believe is the true theory of knowledge which I wish to submit for your criticism the true description of a 
practice which arose in Ionia and which is incorporated in modern science though there are many scientists who still 
believe in the Baconian myth of induction the theory that knowledge proceeds by way of conjectures and 
refutations 

Two of the greatest men who clearly saw that there was no such thing as an inductive procedure and who clearly 
understood what I regard as the true theory of knowledge were Galileo and Einstein Yet the ancients also knew it 
Incredible as it sounds we find a clear recognition and formulation of this theory of rational knowledge almost 
immediately after the practice of critical discussion had begun Our oldest extant fragments in this field are those of 
Xenophanes I will present here five of them in an order that suggests that it was the boldness of his attack and the 
gravity of his problems which made him conscious of the fact that all our knowledge was guesswork yet that we may 
nevertheless by searching for that knowledge which is the better find it in the course of time Here are the five 
fragments DK B  and    and  from Xenophanes writings 

The Ethiops say that their gods are flatnosed and black 
While the Thracians say that theirs have blue eyes and red hair 

Yet if cattle or horses or lions had hands and could draw 
And could sculpture like men then the horses would draw their gods 
Like horses and cattle like cattle and each would then shape 
Bodies of gods in the likeness each kind of its own 

The gods did not reveal from the beginning 
All things to us but in the course of time 
Through seeking men find that which is the better    

 

 

These things are we conjecture like the truth 

But as for certain truth no man has known it 
Nor will he know it neither of the gods 
Nor yet of all the things of which I speak 
And even if by chance he were to utter 
The final truth he would himself not know it 
For all is but a woven web of guesses 

To show that Xenophanes was not alone I may also repeat here two of Heraclitus sayings DK B  and  which I 
have quoted before in a different context Both express the conjectural character of human knowledge and the 
second refers to its daring to the need to anticipate boldly what we do not know 

It is not in the nature or character of man to possess true knowledge though it is in the divine 
nature    He who does not expect the unexpected will not detect it for him it will remain 
undetectable and unapproachable 

My last quotation is a very famous one from Democritus DK B  

But in fact nothing do we know from having seen it for the truth is hidden in the deep 

This is how the critical attitude of the Presocratics foreshadowed and prepared for the ethical rationalism of Socrates 
his belief that the search for truth through critical discussion was a way of lifethe best he knew 

APPENDIX HISTORICAL CONJECTURES AND 
HERACLITUS ON CHANGE 

In an article entitled Popper on Science and the Presocratics  Mind NS  July  pp  to  Mr G S 
Kirk has responded to a challenge and to a criticism which formed part of my presidential address to the Aristotelian 
Society Back to the Presocratics Mr Kirks article is not however mainly devoted to the task of replying to my 
criticism It is largely devoted to another task it tries to explain how and why I am the victim of a fundamentally 
mistaken attitude to scientific methodology which has made me come forward with mistaken assertions about the 
Presocratics and with mistaken principles of historiography 

A counterattack of this kind might to be sure have its intrinsic merits and interest And the fact that Mr Kirk has 
adopted this procedure shows at any rate that he and I agree at least on two points that the fundamental issue 

 

This Appendix a reply to Mr Kirks article in Mind has not been previously published although part it has been 
accepted for publication in Mind as a discussion note I wish to thank the editor of Mind for permitting me to 
publish here the whole article as originally submitted to him 

 

between us is a philosophical one and that the philosophical attitude we adopt can have a decisive influence on our 
interpretation of the historical evidencesuch as for example the evidence concerning the Presocratics 

Now Mr Kirk does not accept my general philosophical attitude any more than I do his Thus he rightly feels that he 
should give reasons for rejecting mine 

I do not think that he has offered any reason for rejecting my views simply because Mr Kirks views on what he 
believes to be my views and the devastating conclusions he draws from these views are unrelated to my actual 
views as I shall show 

There is another difficulty The method of counterattack which he has adopted has its own peculiar drawback it does 
not seem to lend itself easily to furthering the discussion of the definite points of criticism made in my address Kirk 
does not for instance state very clearly which of my points he accepts for he does accept some and which he 
rejects instead acceptance and rejection are submerged in a general rejection of what he believes to be my attitude 
to scientific methodology and of some of the consequences of this imaginary attitude 

I 

My first task will be to give some evidence for my allegation that Kirks treatment of my attitude to scientific 
methodology is largely based upon misunderstandings and misreadings of what I have written and upon popular 
inductivist misconceptions about natural science which were fully discussed and dismissed in my book The Logic 
of Scientific Discovery LScD 

Kirk rightly presents me as an opponent of the widely accepted dogma of inductivismof the view that science 
starts from observation and proceeds by induction to generalizations and ultimately to theories But he is mistaken 
in believing that since I am an opponent of induction I must be an adherent of intuition and that my approach 
must be due to an attempt to defend an intuitionist philosophy which he calls traditional philosophy against modern 
empiricism Yet although I do not believe in induction I do not believe in intuition either Inductivists are inclined to 
think that intuition is the only alternative to induction But they are simply mistaken there are other possible 
approaches besides these two And my own view may be fairly described as critical empiricism 

But Kirk ascribes to me an almost Cartesian intuitionism when he presents the situation as follows p   
Philosophy of the traditional type had assumed that philosophical truths were metaphysical in content and could be 
apprehended by intuition The positivists of the Vienna Circle denied this In disagreeing with them Popper was 
asserting his belief in something not far distant from the classical conception of the role of philosophy Whatever one 
may say about this there certainly exists a traditional philosophythat of Descartes or Spinoza for examplefor 
which intuition is a source of 

 

 

 

knowledge but I have always opposed this philosophy  From this passage on Kirk writes intuition in the sense in 
which he uses it here several times in quotes pp      and several times out of quotes pp  
       yet always apparently under the impressionand certainly creating the impression
that he is citing me when ascribing to me intuitionistic views which in fact I have never held in my life However the 
only time the word intuition occurs in my address  it is used in a context which is antiinductivist and anti
intuitionist at the same time For I write there p   this volume p   about the problem of the scientific character 
of a theory italics not in the original What is important about a theory is its explanatory power and whether it 
stands up to criticism and to tests The question of its origin of how it is arrived atwhether by an inductive 
procedure as some say or by an act of intuition    has little to do with its scientific status or 
character  

Now Kirk quotes this passage and discusses it But the undeniable fact that this passage indicates that I am a 
believer in neither induction nor intuition does not prevent him from constantly ascribing to me intuitionist views He 
does so for example in the passage on p  quoted above or on p  when he discusses the question whether 
to accept my alleged premise that science starts from intuitions while I say it starts from problems see below or on 
p  f when he writes Are we therefore to infer with Popper that Thaless theory must have been based on a non
empirical intuition 

Now my own view is very different from all this As to the starting point of science I do not say that science starts 
from intuitions but that it starts from problems that we arrive at a new theory in the main by trying to solve 
problems that these problems arise in our attempts to understand the world as we know itthe world of our 
experience where experience consists largely of expectations or theories and partly also of observational 
knowledgealthough I happen to believe that there does not exist anything like pure observational knowledge 
untainted by expectations or theories A few of these problemsand some of the most interesting onesarise from 
the conscious criticism of theories uncritically accepted hitherto or from the conscious criticism of the theory of a 
predecessor One of the main things I set out to do in my paper on the Presocratics was to suggest that 
Anaximanders theory may well have originated in an attempt to criticize Thales and that this may well have been the 
origin of the rationalist tradition which I identify with the tradition of critical discussion 

 

 Kirk quotes on p  my LScD p  but a reading of what precedes my reference there to Bergson will 
show that my admission that every discovery contains among other elements an irrational element or a 
creative intuition is neither irrationalist nor intuitionist in the sense of any traditional philosophy See also my 
Introduction to the present volume On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance especially pp  ff 
 There are also casual occurrences such as uncanny intuition less formal and more intuitive reasons and From 
this we see intuitively on pp  and  this volume pp  and   In all cases the word is used in a non
technical and almost deprecatory sense 
 The words in square brackets have now been added by me in order to make my meaning clearer 

 

 

I do not think that a view of this kind has much similarity to traditional intuitionistic philosophy And I was surprised to 
find that Kirk suggests that my mistaken approach might be explained as that of a speculative philosopher not 
sufficiently intimately acquainted with scientific practice he suggests for example on p   It seems possible that 
his  Poppers view of science was not the result of an initial objective observation of how scientists proceed but was 
itself in an early application of Poppers developed theory an intuition closely related to current philosophical 
difficulties and subsequently compared with actual scientific procedure  I should have thought that even a reader 
who knows very little about science might have noticed that some at least of my problems originated within the 
physical sciences themselves and that my own acquaintance with scientific practice and research was not wholly 
secondhand 

The kind of critical discussion I have in mind is of course a discussion in which experience plays a major role 
observation and experiment are constantly appealed to as tests of our theories Yet Kirk surprisingly goes so far p 
  italics mine as to speak of  Poppers thesis that all scientific theories are entirely based on 
intuitions 

Like most philosophers I am quite used to seeing my views distorted and caricatured But this is hardly a caricature 
which must always rely on a recognizable similarity to the original I may remark that none of my empiricist and 
positivist friends opponents and critics have ever criticized me for holding or for reviving an intuitionist 
epistemology and that on the contrary they usually say that my epistemology does not significantly deviate from 
theirs 

It will be seen from the foregoing that Kirk offers several conjectures not only about the content of my philosophy but 
also about its origin But he does not seem to be aware of the conjectural character of these constructions On the 
contrary he believes that he has some textual evidence for them For he says of me that my own attitude of scientific 
methodology    was formed as he  Popper  writes in the  preface to The Logic of Scientific Discovery 
in reaction against the attempts of the Vienna Circle to base all philosophical sic  and scientific truth upon 
verification by experience  Kirk p  I need not comment here on this mistaken description of the Wittgensteinian 
philosophy of the Vienna Circle But since it is a historian of philosophy who writes here about what I have written I 
feel I must nip in the bud a historical myth about what I have written For in the preface to which Kirk refers I do not 
say a word about how I formed my views or my attitude nor do I say a word about the Vienna Circle Indeed I could 
not have written anything resembling Kirks account because the facts are otherwise Part of the story first 
published in  Mr Kirk might have found in a Cambridge lecture of mine now in this volume under the title 
Science Conjectures and Refutations in which I tell how I developed my attitude    in reaction 

 

 It is Kirk who puts the word intuition in quotes thereby suggesting that it is I who use intuition in this sense 

 

 

against the attempts of Marx Freud and Adler none of whom was either a positivist or a member of the Vienna 
Circle It seems unlikely that it was the Heraclitean obscurity of my style which caused this quite inexplicable 
misreading by Mr Kirk for in comparing it with Back to the Presocratics he describes p   the same  
preface to which his above quoted passage refers as a more lucid statement 

Another example of misreading The Logic of Scientific Discovery is equally inexplicableat least for anybody 
who has read the book as far as p  not to mention pp  or   where I refer to the problem of truth and to 
Alfred Tarskis theory of truth Kirk says that  Popper abandons the concept of absolute scientific truth p   He 
does not seem to see that when I say that we cannot know even of a wellcorroborated scientific theory whether or 
not it is true I am actually assuming a concept of absolute scientific truth just as somebody who says I did not 
succeed in reaching the goal operates with an absolute concept of a goalthat is one whose existence is assumed 
independently of its being reached 

It is surprising to find these obvious misunderstandings and these occasional misquotations in a paper by an 
outstanding scholar and historian of philosophy Yet they make a philosophical defence of my real views about 
science unnecessary 

II 

I can now therefore turn to something more importantto my criticism of the Presocratics and to Kirks response to it 
In this section I shall confine myself to answering two of Kirks points which are connected with questions of method 

 Kirk discusses on p  a remark of mine which I made in order to disclaim any competence regarding such 
matters as text emendation The passage he quotes reads I am completely out of my depth when an expert begins 
to argue what words or phrases Heraclitus might have used and what words or phrases he could not possibly have 
used 

Commenting on this disclaimer of competence Kirk exclaims As though what words or phrases Heraclitus might 
have used for example is irrelevant to the assessment of what he thought 

But I never said or suggested that these matters are irrelevant I merely confessed that I had not studied the 
linguistic usages of Heraclitus and others sufficiently deeply to feel myself equipped to discuss the work done in this 
field by such scholars as say Burnet or Diels or Reinhardt and more recently Vlastos or Kirk himself 

Yet Kirk goes on to say that 

It is these words and phrases and the other verbatim fragments of the Presocratics themselves 
and not the reports of Plato Aristotle and the doxographers as Popper appears to think that are the 
oldest texts we possess    It should in fact be obvious even to an amateur that the reconstruction 
of Presocratic thought must be based both upon the later tradition and upon the surviving fragments 

 

 

I cannot imagine how my disclaimer of competence in the field of linguistic criticism can have induced Kirk to suggest 
that such things are not obvious even to the particular amateur in question Moreover he might have noticed that 
fairly frequently I quote translate and discuss the fragments themselves much more than the reports of Plato and 
Aristotle though we now seem to agree that these are quite relevant also both in Back to the Presocratics and in 
my Open Society where I discussed for example a considerable number of the surviving fragments of Heraclitus 
Kirk refers to this book on p  Why then does he on p  interpret my disclaimer in the sense that I disclaim 
interest in the surviving fragments or in the problem of their historical status 

 As an example of the way unsatisfactory in my opinion in which Kirk answers the criticisms I made in Back to the 
Presocratics I now quote the end of his reply p   He says 

More startling still he  Popper  applies the criterion of possible truth as the test of the historicity of a 
theory On page  he  Popper  finds that the suggestion that we should test the historicity of 
Heraclitus ideas    by standards of common sense is a little surprising Shall we  Kirk  not find his 
 Poppers own test much more surprisingBut the decisive point is of course that this inspired 
philosophy ie that man is a flame etc is true for all we know p  in this volume p   

The simple answer to this is that I neither said nor implied that the truth or the possible truth of a theory is a test of 
its historicity This may be seen from pages  and  of my addressin this volume pp  fand the second 
paragraph of section vii incidentally did Kirk forget his thesis that I have abandoned the idea of truth And when 
Kirk here puts test in quotesthereby indicating that I have used the term test in this context or in this sensethen 
he clearly misquotes me For all I have said or implied is that the truth of that theory of change which has been 
traditionally and I think correctly attributed to Heraclitus shows that this attribution at least makes sense of 
Heraclitus philosophywhile I at any rate could not make sense of the philosophy attributed to Heraclitus by Kirk 
Incidentally I do think that it is an important and even an obvious principle of the historiography and interpretation of 
ideas that we should always try to attribute to a thinker an interesting and a true theory rather than an uninteresting or 
a false one provided of course the transmitted historical evidence allows us to do so This is neither a 
criterion nor a test to be sure but he who does not try to apply this principle of historiography is unlikely to 
understand a great thinker such as Heraclitus 

III 

The most important disagreement between Kirk and me as far as the Presocratics are concerned was over the 
interpretation of Heraclitus And here I claim that Kirk perhaps unconsciously has almost ceded my two main points 
which I am going to discuss below under  and  

 

 

My general approach to Heraclitus may be put in the words of Karl Reinhardt The history of philosophy is the history 
of its problems If you want to explain Heraclitus tell us first what his problem was  

My answer to this challenge was that Heraclitus problem is the problem of changethe general problem How 
is change possible How can a thing change without losing its identityin which case it would be no longer that 
thing which has changed See Back to the Presocratics sections viii and ix 

I believe that Heraclitus great message was linked with his discovery of this exciting problem and I believe that his 
discovery led to Parmenides solution that change indeed is logically impossible for any thingfor any being and 
later to the closely related theory of Leucippus and Democritus that things do not indeed change intrinsically 
although they change their positions in the void 

The solution of this problem which following Plato Aristotle and the fragments I attribute to Heraclitus is as 
follows there are no unchanging things what appears to us as a thing is a process In reality a material thing is like 
a flame for a flame seems to be a material thing but it is not it is a process it is in flux matter passes through it it 
is like a river 

Thus all the apparently more or less stable things are really in flux and some of themthose which indeed appear 
stableare in invisible flux Thus Heraclitus philosophy prepares the way for the Parmenidian distinction between 
appearance and reality 

In order to appear as a stable thing the process which is the reality behind the thing has to be regular lawlike 
measured the lamp which holds a stable flame has to supply to it a definite measure of oil It seems not unlikely 
that the idea of a measured or lawlike process was developed by Heraclitus from suggestions of the Milesians 
especially of Anaximander about the significance of the cosmic periodic changes such as day and night perhaps 
also the tides the waxing and waning of the moon and especially the seasons of the year These regularities might 
well have contributed to the idea that the apparent stability of things and even of the cosmos can be explained as a 
measured processa process ruled by law 

 The first of the two main points on which I criticized Kirks views on Heraclitus is this Kirk suggested that 
Heraclitus did not believe and that it was against common sense to believe that a rock or a bronze cauldron    was 
invariably undergoing invisible changes Kirks lengthy discussion 

 

 K Reinhardt Parmenides nd ed  p  I cannot mention this book without expressing my unbounded 
admiration for it even though I feel that I must reluctantly disagree with its fundamental doctrine that Parmenides 
not only originated his problem independently of Heraclitus but preceded Heraclitus to whom he handed on his 
problem I believe however that Reinhardt has given overwhelming reasons for the view that one of these two 
philosophers depends upon the other I may perhaps say that my attempt to locate as it were Heraclitus 
problem may be regarded as an attempt to answer Reinhardts challenge quoted in the text See also section vi 
of ch  above 

 

 

pp  ff of my criticism ultimately arrives at a point about which he says 

At this point the argument becomes somewhat rarefied I agree though that it remains theoretically 
possible that certain invisible changes of our experience for example the gradual rusting of iron 
cited by Popper struck Heraclitus so forcefully that they persuaded him to assert that all things which 
were not in visible change were in invisible change I do not think however that the extant fragments 
suggest that this was the case p   

I do not think that the argument need in any sense become rarefied and there are many extant fragments which 
suggest the theory which I attribute to Heraclitus Yet before referring to these I must repeat a question which I raised 
in my address if as Kirk and Raven agree fire is as it were the structural model or the prototype or the archetypal 
form as they have it of matter what else can this mean but that material things are like flames and therefore 
processes 

I do not of course assert that Heraclitus used an abstract term like process But I conjecture that he did apply his 
theory not only to matter in the abstract or to the world order as a whole as Kirk says on p   but also to 
concrete single things and these things then must be compared to concrete single flames 

As to the extant fragments in support of this view and of my interpretation in general there are first the fragments 
about the sun It seems to me pretty clear that Heraclitus regarded the sun as a thing or perhaps even as a new 
thing every day see DK B  which says  The sun is new every day though this may perhaps only mean that it is 
like a lamp rekindled every day Were there no sun it would be night in spite of the other stars says B  See also 
B  and my remark above concerning lamps and measures and compare B  Or take B  If not stirred the 
barleybrew decomposes Thus movement process is essential to the continued existence of the thing which 
otherwise ceases to exist Or take B  What is at variance with itself is in accord with itself it is a harmony resulting 
from tension as in the bow and the lyre It is the tension the active force the inherent strife a process which 
makes bow and lyre what they are and only as long as the tension is kept up only as long as the strife of their parts 
goes on do they continue to be what they are 

Admittedly Heraclitus likes generalizations and abstractions and so he proceeds at once to a generalization which 
may well be intended as one on a cosmic scale as in B  The opposites agree and from discord results the best 
harmony See also B  But this does not mean that he loses sight of the single things the bow the lyre the lamp 
the flame the river B   a Upon those who step into the same rivers different and again different waters 
flow    We step into the same rivers and we do not step into the same rivers We are and we are not 

Yet before becoming symbols of the cosmic processes the rivers are 

 

 I am quoting from DielsKranz Fragmente der Vorsokratiker   

 

 

concrete rivers and beyond that symbols of other concrete things including ourselves And although we are and 
we are not which incidentally Kirk and Raven prefer not to attribute to Heraclitus is in a sense a sweeping and 
perhaps cosmic generalization and abstraction it is no doubt also meant as a very concrete appeal to every man it is 
a Heraclitean memento mori like so many other fragments which remind us that life becomes death and death 
becomes life Compare for example B        

If B  a moves towards something like a generalization B  moves from the general and cosmic idea of a 
consuming and dying fire to the particular Everything is an exchange for fire and fire for everything just as wares 
for gold and gold for wares 

Thus when Kirk now asks p   Can we then say that the conclusion that all things separately are in permanent 
flux is necessarily entailed by any course of reasoning followed by Heraclitus  then the answer is an emphatic 
yes as far as we can speak at all of anything as being necessarily entailed by a course of reasoning in a field 
where everything must remain to some extent conjecture and interpretation 

Thus take for example B  What is cold becomes hot and what is hot becomes cold what is moist becomes dry 
and what is dry becomes moist This may well have a cosmic significance it may refer to the seasons and to cosmic 
change But how can it be doubted especially if we attribute to Heraclitus common sense whatever this may mean 
  that it applies to concrete individual things and their changesand incidentally to ourselves and our souls Cp B 
    

But things are not only in fluxthey are invisibly in flux So we read in B  It is always one and the same what is 
alive and what is dead what is awake and what is asleep what is young and what is old For the one turns into the 
other and the other turns back into the one Thus our children age as we know invisibly yet the parents also turn
somehowinto their children See also B     and  Or take B  In a circle the beginning and the 
end are the same The identity of opposites opposites invisibly merging into each other see also B  

That Heraclitus notices that these processes may indeed be invisible and that he therefore felt that sight and 
observation were deceptive may be seen from B     sight is deceptive B  Invisible harmony is stronger than 
visible See also B  and  B  Nature loves to hide See also B  and  

I have not the slightest doubt that any one or all of these fragments may be explained away But they do seem to me 
to support what it is reasonable to 

 

 Kirk it seems has misunderstood my criticism of his appeal to common sense I criticized the view that there 
was in these matters a straightforward standard of common sense to which the historiographer could appeal and 
I suggested but only suggested that my interpretation of Heraclitus may attribute to him perhaps as much or 
more common sense than Kirks interpretation Besides I also suggested that Heraclitus was the last man on 
earth whose sayings were to be measured by somebody elses standard of common sense And is not the 
invisible change in Ovids gutta cavat common sense 

 

 

assume in any case and what is in addition supported by Platoand Aristotle And though the evidence of the latter 
has become suspect especially in view of the great work of Harold Cherniss nobody thinksand least of all Harold 
Chernissthat Aristotles evidence has been completely discredited including that which is supported by Plato or by 
the fragments 

 The last point of my reply and my second and main point about Heraclitus concerns the general summary of his 
philosophy which can be found in Kirk and Raven on p  under the heading Conclusion 

I quoted part of this conclusion in my address and said that I found the doctrine attributed by Kirk and Raven to 
Heraclitus absurd and in order to make quite clear what I regarded as absurd I used italics I repeat here my 
quotation from Kirk and Raven with the italics as previously used by me What I found absurd is the allegedly 
Heraclitean doctrine that natural changes of all kinds and thus presumably also earthquakes and great fires are 
regular and balanced and that the cause of this balance is fire the common constituent of things 
that was also termed their Logos See p  above 

I did not object to anybody attributing to Heraclitus the doctrine that change is ruled by law or perhaps the more 
doubtful doctrine that the rule or regularity was their Logos or the doctrine that the common constituent of things 
was fire What I felt to be absurd were the doctrines a that all changes or changes of all kinds are balanced 
in the sense in which many important changes and processes such as the fire in a lamp or the cosmic seasons may 
well be called balanced b that fire is the cause of this balance and c that the common constituent of 
thingsthat is firewas also termed their Logos 

Moreover I could find no traces of these doctrines in Heraclitus fragments nor in any of the ancient sources such as 
Plato or Aristotle 

Where then is the source of this summary or conclusionthat is to say the source of the three points a b and 
c which express Kirks general view of Heraclitus philosophy and which colour so much of his interpretation of the 
fragments 

Reading the chapter on Heraclitus in Kirk and Raven again I could find only one hint the doctrines to which I object 
are first formulated on p  with reference to the fragment which they number  See also p  Now Kirk and 
Ravens  is the same fragment as DK B  It is the thunderbolt which steers all things 

Why should this fragment make Kirk ascribing to Heraclitus the doctrines a b and c Is it not quite satisfactorily 
explained if we remember that the thunderbolt is the instrument of Zeus For according to Heraclitus DK B   KR 
 One thingthe only one that is wisewants and does not want to be called by the name of Zeus This seems 
quite sufficient to explain DK B  There is no necessity to connect it with DK   KR  though this could only 
further strengthen my interpretation 

But Kirk and Raven interpret on pages  and  the fragment It is the thunderbolt which steers all things more 
elaborately first by identifying the 

 

 

thunderbolt with fire secondly by attributing to fire a directive capacity thirdly by suggesting that fire reflects divinity 
and fourthly by suggesting its identification with the Logos 

What is the source of this somewhat overelaborate interpretation of a short and simple fragment I could find no 
trace of it in any of the ancient sourcesthe fragments themselves or Plato or Aristotle The only trace I could find 
was an interpretation of Hippolytus whom Kirk and Raven describe on p  of their book as a theologian in Rome in 
the third century AD almost six centuries junior to Plato who attacked Christian heresies by claiming them to be 
revivals of pagan philosophy It seems that he not only attacked the Noetian heresy by claiming that it was a revival 
of Heraclitus theory but also that he contributed by these attacks to the extermination of the heresy 

Hippolytus is also the source of B  the beautiful fragment about the thunderbolt He quotes it apparently because 
he wants to interpret it as closely related to the Noetian heresy In this attempt he identifies the thunderbolt first with 
fire next with eternal or divine fire endowed with a providential directive capacity as Kirk and Raven have it and 
with prudence or reason  Kirk and Raven have Logos and ultimately he interprets the Heraclitean fire as the 
cause of the cosmic housekeeping or of the directorship or the economic government that keeps the balance of 
the world  Kirk and Raven have it that fire is the cause of this balance 

The first of these identifications of Hippolytus might indeed have had a basis in the text Karl Reinhardt in an article 
in Hermes   conjectures that there was a lost fragment alluded to in Hippolytus which read pur 
phronimon or pur Phronoun I am unable to evaluate the force of Reinhardts arguments though to me they do 
not appear very compelling But the alleged lost fragment itself would fit perfectly well into my interpretation since I 
interpret Heraclitus to mean that weour soulsare flames thinking fire or fire as a thought process would of course 
fit very well But only a Christianor heretical Christianinterpretation could render it fire is providence and as to the 
cause of Hippolytus Reinhardt says explicitly that this is a nonHeraclitean interpretation The balance comes in as 
far as I can see only on the Christian day of judgment as the balance of justice 

Thus the doctrine whose attribution to Heraclitus I found so unacceptable appears to be Kirks interpretation of an 
interpretation through which Hippolytus may have tried to establish the semiChristian character of Heraclitus 
teachingperhaps as Karl Reinhardt suggests in an attempt to fasten upon the Noetians heretic doctrines of pagan 
origin such as the doctrine that fire is endowed with providential reason and that it is the providential cause of the 
continued balance of the worldprocess 

Though Hippolytus may perhaps be a good source when he cites Heraclitus he clearly cannot be taken very 
seriously when he interprets Heraclitus 

Considering its doubtful source it is far from surprising that I could not make any sense of the quoted final summary 
or conclusion of Kirk and 

 

 

Raven I still feel that the doctrine there ascribed by Kirk and Raven to Heraclitus is absurdespecially the words 
which were italicized by me and I am sure that I am not alone in this feeling Yet Kirk now writes on p   
referring to the passage in my address where I discuss his conclusion and say that it is absurd Popper is indeed 
isolated when he asserts that such an interpretation of Heraclitus is absurd But when we look more closely at 
Kirks present interpretation we find that he has almost conceded my point he now omits almost all the words which I 
put in italics because they seemed absurd to me and in addition the words changes of all kinds and he omits 
more especially the statement that the cause of the balance is fire and that was also termed their 
Logos 

For Kirk now writes on p  suggesting that this is the interpretation of Heraclitus which I described as absurd  
Heraclitus accepted change in all its manifest presence and inevitability but claimed that the unity of the worldorder 
was not thereby prejudiced it was preserved through the logos which operates in all natural changes and ensures 
their ultimate equilibrium 

I think that even this interpretation might perhaps be formulated more happily but it is no longer absurd On the 
contrary it seems to agree for example with the interpretation which I myself gave in my Open Society where I 
suggested that the logos may be the law of change Moreover though I strongly object to describing fire with Kirk 
and Raven or with Hippolytus as the cause of balance I do not object to an interpretation which lays some stress 
on balance or on balanced change Indeed if the apparently stable material things are in reality processes like 
flames then they must burn slowly in a measured way They will like the flame of a lamp or like that of the sun not 
overstep their measure they will not get out of control as a conflagration might We may remember here that it is 
movement a process that keeps the barley brew from decomposing separating disintegrating and that it is not 
every kind of movement that has this effect but for example a circular and thus a measured movement It is 
therefore the measure which may be called the cause of the balance of fire of flames and of thingsof those 
processes and changes which appear as stable and as things at rest and which are responsible for the preservation 
of things The measure the rule the lawful change the logos but not the fire is the cause of balanceincluding 
especially the balance of a fire when it is under control such as a balanced flame or the sun or the moon or the 
soul 

It is clear that according to this view most of the balanced change must necessarily be invisible this kind of balanced 
or lawful change must be inferred by reasoning Perhaps this is why it is called the logos 

This seems to be the way which led Heraclitus to his new epistemology with its distrust of sense experience thus 
preparing for Parmenides still sharper distinction between sense and reason which he used to turn the tables upon 
his predecessor by proving that change was logically impossible and an illusion of the senses 

Of course this whole picture is conjectural and it is necessarily somewhat 

 

 

idealized But it shows how the epistemological and the logical problems may have arisen out of the attempt to solve 
cosmological problems And it shows more generally how the Presocratic philosophies may have developed through 
the clash of ideas in a critical debate which was conducted partly in an attempt to solve the problems that presented 
themselves in the course of that critical debate 

It almost seems more than a conjecture that this at least did happen 

 

 

  
A NOTE ON BERKELEY AS PRECURSOR OF MACH AND EINSTEIN 
I 

THE PURPOSE of this note is to give a list of those ideas of Berkeleys in the field of the philosophy of physics which 
have a strikingly new look They are mainly ideas which were rediscovered and reintroduced into the discussion of 
modern physics by Ernst Mach and Heinrich Hertz and by a number of philosophers and physicists some of them 
influenced by Mach such as Bertrand Russell Philip Frank Richard von Mises Moritz Schlick  Werner Heisenberg 
and others 

I may say at once that I do not agree with most of these positivistic views I admire Berkeley without agreeing with 
him But criticism of Berkeley is not the purpose of this note and will be confined to some very brief and incomplete 
remarks in section v  

Berkeley wrote only one work De Motu devoted exclusively to the philosophy of physical science 
but there are passages in many of his other works in which similar ideas and supplementary 
ones are represented  

The core of Berkeleys ideas on the philosophy of science is in his criticism of Newtons 
dynamics  Newtons mathematics were criticized by Berkeley in The Analyst and its two 
sequels Berkeley was full of admiration for 

 

 Schlick under the influence of Wittgenstein suggested an instrumentalist interpretation of universal laws which 
was practically equivalent to Berkeleys mathematical hypotheses see Naturwissenschaften   pp 
 and  For further references see footnote  to section iv of ch  above 
 I have since developed these ideas more fully in ch  above especially section vi 

 Apart from DM  De Motu  I shall quote TV  Essay towards a New Theory of Vision 
 Pr  Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge  HP  Three 
Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous  Alc  Alciphron  An  The Analyst 
 and S  Siris  As far as I know there does not exist an English translation of 
DM which succeeds in making clear what Berkeley meant to say and the Editor of the latest 
edition of the Works even goes out of his way to belittle the significance of this highly original 
and in many ways unique essay 

 

 

Newton and no doubt realized that there could have been no worthier object for his criticism 
II 
The following twentyone theses are not always expressed in Berkeleys terminology their order is not connected 
with the order in which they appear in Berkeleys writings or in which they might be presented in a systematic 
treatment of Berkeleys thought For a motto I open my list with a quotation from Berkeley  DM  
 
 

To utter a word and mean nothing by it is unworthy of a philosopher 
The meaning of a word is the idea or the sensequality with which it is associated as its name Thus the words 
absolute space and absolute time are without any empirical or operational meaning Newtons doctrine of 
absolute space and absolute time must therefore be rejected as a physical theory Cf Pr    DM 
   An  Qu  S  Concerning absolute space that phantom of the mechanical and 
geometrical philosophers it may suffice to observe that it is neither perceived by our sense nor proved by our 
reason    DM  for    the purpose of the philosophers of mechanics    it suffices to replace their 
absolute space by a relative space determined by the heavens of the fixed stars    Motion and rest defined 
by this relative space can be conveniently used instead of the absolutes    
The same holds for the word absolute motion The principle that all motion is relative can be established by 
appealing to the meaning of motion or else to operationalist arguments Cf Pr as above   To 
denominate a body moved it is requisite    that it changes its distance or situation with regard to some other 
body    DM  No motion can be discerned or measured except with the help of sensible things DM  
   the motion of a stone in a sling or of water in a whirled bucket cannot be called truly circular motion    by 
those who define motion with the help of absolute space    
The words gravity and force are misused in physics to introduce force as the cause or principle of motion or 
of an acceleration is to introduce an occult quality  DM  and especially       Alc vii  
More precisely we should say an occult metaphysical substance for the term occult quality is a misnomer in 
so far as quality should more properly be reserved for observable or observed qualitiesqualities which are 
given to our senses and which of course are never occult  An  Qu  and especially DM  It is plain 
then that it is useless to assume that the principle of motion is gravity or force for how could this principle be 
known any more clearly through what has been called an occult quality That which is itself occult explains 
nothing Not to mention that an unknown acting cause should more properly be called a metaphysical 
substance rather than a quality 
In view of these considerations Newtons theory cannot be accepted as an explanation which is truly causal ie 
based on true natural causes The view 

 

 

 

 

that gravity causally explains the motion of bodies that of the planets of freefalling bodies etc or that 
Newton discovered that gravity or attraction is an essential quality  Pr  whose inherence in the essence 
or nature of bodies explains the laws of their motion must be discarded  S  see also S  last 
sentence But it must be admitted that Newtons theory leads to the correct results  DM  
 To understand this it is of the greatest importance    to distinguish between mathematical 
hypotheses and the natures  or essences  of things    If we observe this distinction then all the 
famous theorems of mechanical philosophy which    make it possible to subject the world system ie the 
solar system to human calculations may be preserved and at the same time the study of motion will be freed 
of a thousand pointless trivialities and subtleties and from meaningless abstract ideas  DM  
In physics mechanical philosophy there is no causal explanation cf S  ie no explanation based upon 
the discovery of the hidden nature or essence of things  Pr     real efficient causes of the motion    of 
bodies do not in any way belong to the field of mechanics or of experimental science Nor can they throw any 
light on these     DM  
The reason is simply that physical things have no secret or hidden true or real nature no real essence no 
internal qualities  Pr  
There is nothing physical behind the physical bodies no occult physical reality Everything is surface as 
it were physical bodies are nothing but their qualities Their appearance is their reality  Pr   
The province of the scientist of the mechanical philosopher is the discovery by experiment and 
reasoning  S  of Laws of Nature that is to say of the regularities and uniformities of natural 
phenomena 

  The Laws of Nature are in fact regularities or similarities or analogies  Pr  in the perceived motions of 
physical bodies  S     these we learn from experience  Pr  they are observed or inferred from 
observations  Pr   S   
Once the Laws of Nature have been formed it becomes the task of the philosopher to show of each 
phenomenon that it is in conformity with these laws that is necessarily follows from these principles  DM 
 cf Pr  and S  their ie the mechanical philosophers province being    to account for 
particular phenomena by reducing them under and showing their conformity to such general rules 

  This process may be called if we like explanation even causal explanation so long as we distinguish it 

clearly from the truly causal ie metaphysical explanation based upon the true nature or essence of things S 
 DM  A thing may be said to be mechanically explained if it is reduced to those most simple and 
universal principles ie the primary laws of motion which have been proved by experiments    DM  and 
proved by accurate reasoning to be in agreement and connection with them    This means to explain and 
solve the phenomena and to assign them their 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Concerning the equivalence of natures and essences see my Open Society ch  section vi 

 

 

 

cause   This terminology is admissible cf DM  but it must not mislead us We must always clearly 
distinguish cf DM  between an essentialist  explanation with appeals to the nature of things and a 
descriptive explanation which appeals to a Law of Nature ie to the description of an observed regularity Of 
these two kinds of explanation only the latter is admissible in physical science 

  From both of these we must now distinguish a third kind of explanationan explanation which appeals to 

mathematical hypotheses A mathematical hypothesis may be described as a procedure for calculating 
certain results It is a mere formalism a mathematical tool or instrument comparable to a calculating machine 
It is judged merely by its efficiency It may not only be admissible it may be useful and it may be admirable yet 
it is not science even if it produces the correct results it is only a trick a knack  An  Qu  And as 
opposed to the explanation by essences which in mechanics are simply false and to that by laws of nature 
which if the laws have been proved by experiment are simply true the question of the truth of a 
mathematical hypothesis does not ariseonly that of its usefulness as a calculating tool 

  Now those principles of the Newtonian theory which have been proved by experimentthose of the laws of 
motion which simply describe the observable regularities of the motion of bodiesare true But the part of the 
theory involving the concepts which have been criticized aboveabsolute space absolute motion force 
attraction gravityis not true since these are mathematical hypotheses As such however they should not be 
rejected if they work well as in the case of force attraction gravity Absolute space and absolute motion have 
to be rejected because they do not work they are to be replaced by the system of fixed stars and motion 
relative to it Force gravity attraction  and words such as these are useful for purposes of reasoning 
and for computations of motions and of moving bodies but they do not help us to understand the simple nature 
of motion itself nor do they serve to designate so many distinct qualities    As far as attraction is concerned it 
is clear that it was not introduced by Newton as a true physical quality but merely as a mathematical 
hypothesis  DM   

  Properly understood a mathematical hypothesis does not claim that anything exists in nature which 

corresponds to itneither to the words or terms with which it operates nor to the functional dependencies which 
it appears to assert It erects as it were a fictitious mathematical world behind that of appearance but without 
the claim that this world exists But what is said of forces residing in bodies whether attracting or repelling is to 
be regarded only as a mathematical hypothesis and not as anything really 

 

 The term essentialist and essentialism is not Berkeleys but was introduced by me in The Poverty of 
Historicism and in The Open Society and Its Enemies 
 The italics in the Latin original function here as quotation marks 
 This was more or less Newtons own opinion cp Newtons letters to Bentley th January and 
especially th February  and section  of ch  above 

 

 

 

existing in nature  S  cf DM   and especially Alc vii  An  Qu  It claims only that from 
its assumptions the correct consequences can be drawn But it can easily be misinterpreted as claiming more 
as claiming to describe a real world behind the world of appearance But no such world could be described for 
the description would necessarily be meaningless 
It can be seen from this that the same appearances may be successfully calculated from more than one 
mathematical hypothesis and that two mathematical hypotheses which yield the same results concerning the 
calculated appearances may not only differ but even contradict each other especially if they are misinterpreted 
as describing a world of essences behind the world of appearances nevertheless there may be nothing to 
choose between them The foremost of men proffer    many different doctrines and even opposite doctrines 
and yet their conclusions ie their calculated results attain the truth    Newton and Torricelli seem to disagree 
with one another    but the thing is well enough explained by both For all forces attributed to bodies are 
merely mathematical hypotheses     thus the same thing may be explained in different ways  DM  

  The analysis of Newtons theory thus yields the following results 

We must distinguish 

a  Observations of concrete particular things 
b 

Laws of Nature which are either observations of regularities or which are proved comprobatae DM 
 this may perhaps mean here supported or corroborated see DM  by experiments or 
discovered by a diligent observation of the phenomena  Pr  

c  Mathematical hypotheses which are not based on observation but whose consequences agree with the 

phenomena or save the phenomena as the Platonists said 
Essentialist or metaphysical causal explanations which have no place in physical science

Of these four a and b are based on observation and can from experience be known to be true c is not 
based on observation and has only an instrumental significancethus more than one instrument may do the 
trick cf  above and d is known to be false whenever it constructs a world of essences behind the world 
of appearances Consequently c is also known to be false whenever it is interpreted in the sense of d 

  These results clearly apply to cases other than Newtonian theory for example to atomism corpuscular theory 

In so far as this theory attempts to explain the world of appearances by constructing an invisible world of 
inward essences  Pr  behind the world of appearances it must be rejected Cf Pr  An  Qu

  The work of the scientist leads to something that may be called explanation but it is hardly of great value for 

understanding the thing explained since the attainable explanation is not one based upon an insight into the 
nature of things But it is of practical importance It enables us to make both applications and predictions

sequence not upon causal sequenceat least not in the essentialist sense A sudden darkness at noon may 
be a prognostic indicator a warning sign a mark of the coming downpour nobody takes it as its cause Now 
all observed regularities are of this nature even though prognostics or signs are usually mistaken for true 
causes  TV  Pr    S  Alc iv   

  A general practical resultwhich I propose to call  Berkeleys razor of this analysis of physics allows us a 

priori to eliminate from physical science all essentialist explanations If they have a mathematical and a 
predictive content they may be admitted qua mathematical hypotheses while their essentialist interpretation is 
eliminated If not they may be ruled out altogether This razor is sharper than Ockhams all entities are ruled 
out except those which are perceived 

  The ultimate argument for these views the reason why occult substances and qualities physical forces 

structures of corpuscles absolute space and absolute motion etc are eliminated is this we know that there 
are no entities such as these because we know that the words professedly designating them must be 
meaningless To have a meaning a word must stand for an idea that is to say for a perception or 
the memory of a perception in Humes terminology for an impression or its reflection in our memory It may 
also stand for a notion such as God but the words belonging to physical science cannot stand for notions 
Now the words here in question do not stand for ideas Those who assert that active force action and the 
principle of motion are in reality inherent in the bodies maintain a doctrine that is based upon no experience 
and support it by obscure and general terms and so do not themselves understand what they want to 
say  DM  

III 

Everybody who reads this list of twentyone theses must be struck by their modernity They are surprisingly similar 
especially in the criticism of Newton to the philosophy of physics which Ernst Mach taught for many years in the 
conviction that it was new and revolutionary in which he was followed by for example Joseph Petzold and which 
had an immense influence on modern physics especially on the Theory of Relativity There is only one 
difference Machs principle of the economy of thought Denkoekonomie goes beyond what I have called  
Berkeleys razor in so far as it allows us not only to discard certain metaphysical elements but also to distinguish in 
some cases between various competing hypotheses of the kind called by Berkeley mathematical with respect to 
their simplicity Cf  above There is also a striking similarity to Hertz Principles of Mechanics   in 
which he tried to eliminate the concept of force and to Wittgenstein Tractatus 

What is perhaps most striking is that Berkeley and Mach both great admirers of Newton criticize the ideas of 
absolute time absolute space and absolute motion on very similar lines Machs criticism exactly like 

 

 

Berkeleys culminates in the suggestion that all arguments for Newtons absolute space like Foucaults pendulum 
the rotating bucket of water the effect of centrifugal forces upon the shape of the earth fail because these 
movements are relative to the system of the fixed stars 

To show the significance of this anticipation of Machs criticism I may cite two passages one from Mach and one 
from Einstein Mach wrote in the th edition of the Mechanics  ch ii section    of the reception of his 
criticism of absolute motion propounded in earlier editions of his Mechanics Thirty years ago the view that the 
notion of absolute motion is meaningless without any empirical content and scientifically without use was 
generally felt to be very strange Today this view is upheld by many wellknown investigators And Einstein said in his 
obituary notice for Mach  Nachruf auf Mach Physikalische Zeitschr  referring to this view of 
Machs It is not improbable that Mach would have found the Theory of Relativity if at a time when his mind was 
still young the problem of the constancy of velocity of light had agitated the physicists This remark of Einsteins is no 
doubt more than generous  Of the bright light it throws upon Mach some reflection must fall upon Berkeley  

IV 

A few words may be said about the relation of Berkeleys philosophy of science to his metaphysics It is very different 
indeed from Machs 

While the positivist Mach was an enemy of all traditional that is nonpositivistic metaphysics and especially of all 
theology Berkeley was a Christian theologian and intensely interested in Christian apologetics While Mach and 
Berkeley agreed that such words as absolute time absolute space and absolute motion are meaningless and 
therefore to be eliminated from science Mach surely would not have agreed with Berkeley on the reason why physics 
cannot treat of real causes Berkeley believed in causes even in true or real causes but all true or real causes 
were to him efficient or final causes  S  and therefore spiritual and utterly beyond physics cf HP ii He 
also believed in true or real causal explanation  S  or as I may perhaps call it in ultimate explanation This 
for him was God 

All appearances are truly caused by God and explained through Gods intervention This for Berkeley is the simple 
reason why physics can only describe regularities and why it cannot find true causes 

It would be a mistake however to think that the similarity between Berkeley and Mach is by these differences shown 
to be only superficial On the contrary Berkeley and Mach are both convinced that there is no physical 

 

 Mach survived Einstein Special Theory of Relativity by more than eleven years at least eight of which were 
very active years but he remained strongly opposed to it and though he alluded to it in the preface to the last 
seventh German edition   of the Mechanik published during his lifetime the allusion was by way of 
compliment to the opponent of Einstein Hugo Dingler Einsteins name and that of the theory were not mentioned 
 This is not the place to discuss other predecessors of Mach such as Leibniz 

 

 

world of primary qualities or of atoms cf Pr  S   behind the world of physical appearances  Pr  
 Both believed in a form of the doctrine nowadays called phenomenalismthe view that physical things are 
bundles or complexes or constructs of phenomenal qualities of particular experienced colours noises etc Mach 
calls them complexes of elements The difference is that for Berkeley these are directly caused by God For Mach 
they are just there While Berkeley says that there can be nothing physical behind the physical phenomena Mach 
suggests that there is nothing at all behind them 

V 

The great historical importance of Berkeley lies I believe in his protest against essentialist explanations in science 
Newton himself did not interpret his theory in an essentialist sense he himself did not believe that he had discovered 
the fact that physical bodies by their nature are not only extended but endowed with a force of attraction radiating 
from them and proportional to the amount of matter in them But soon after him the essentialist interpretation of his 
theory became the ruling one and remained so till the days of Mach 

In our own day essentialism has been dethroned a Berkeleian or Machian positivism or instrumentalism has after all 
these years become fashionable 

Yet there is clearly a third possibilitya third view as I call it 

Essentialism is I believe untenable It implies the idea of an ultimate explanation for an essentialist explanation is 
neither in need of nor capable of further explanation If it is in the nature of a body to attract others then there is no 
need to ask for an explanation of this fact and no possibility of finding such an explanation Yet we know at least 
since Einstein that explanation may be pushed unexpectedly further and further 

But although we must reject essentialism this does not mean that we have to accept positivism for we may accept 
the third view 

I shall not here discuss the positivist dogma of meaning since I have done so elsewhere I shall make only six 
observations i One can work with something like a world behind the world of appearance without committing 
oneself to essentialism especially if one assumes that we can never know whether there may not be a further world 
behind that world To put it less vaguely one can work with the idea of hierarchical levels of explanatory hypotheses 
There are comparatively low level ones somewhat like what Berkeley had in mind when he spoke of Laws of 
Nature higher ones such as Keplers laws still higher ones such as Newtons theory and next Relativity ii These 
theories are not mathematical hypotheses that is nothing but instruments for the prediction of appearances Their 
function goes very much further for iii there is no pure appearance or pure observation what Berkeley had in mind 
when he spoke of these things was always the result of interpretation and iv it had therefore a theoretical or 
hypothetical admixture v New theories moreover may lead to reinterpretation of old appearances and in this way 

 

 

change the world of appearances vi The multiplicity of explanatory theories which Berkeley noted see Section ii 
 above is used wherever possible to construct for any two competing theories conditions in which they yield 
different observable results so that we can make a crucial test to decide between them winning in this way new 
experience 

A main point of this third view is that science aims at true theories even though we can never be sure that any 
particular theory is true and that science may progress and know that it does so by inventing theories which 
compared with earlier ones may be described as better approximations to what is true 

So we can now admit without becoming essentialist that in science we always try to explain the known by the 
unknown the observed and observable by the unobserved and perhaps unobservable At the same time we 
can now admit without becoming instrumentalist what Berkeley said of the nature of hypotheses in the following 
passage  S  which shows both the weakness of his analysisits failure to realize the conjectural character of 
all science including what he calls the laws of natureand also its strength its admirable understanding of the 
logical structure of hypothetical explanation 

It is one thing Berkeley writes to arrive at general laws of nature from a contemplation of the phenomena and 
another to frame an hypothesis and from thence deduce the phenomena Those who suppose epicycles and by 
them explain the motions and appearances of the planets may not therefore be thought to have discovered principles 
true in fact and nature And albeit we may from the premises infer a conclusion it will not follow that we can argue 
reciprocally and from the conclusion infer the premises For instance supposing an elastic fluid whose constituent 
minute particles are equidistant from each other and of equal densities and diameters and recede one from another 
with a centrifugal force which is inversely as the distance of the centres and admitting that from such supposition it 
must follow that the density and elastic force of such fluid are in the inverse proportion of the space it occupies when 
compressed by any force yet we cannot reciprocally infer that a fluid endowed with this property must therefore 
consist of such supposed equal particles 

 

 

  
KANTS CRITIQUE AND COSMOLOGY 

ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY years ago Immanuel Kant died having spent the eighty years of his life in the Prussian 
provincial town of Knigsberg For years his retirement had been complete  and his friends intended a quiet burial 
But this son of an artisan was buried like a king When the rumour of his death spread through the town the people 
flocked to his house demanding to see him On the day of the funeral the life of the town was at a standstill The 
coffin was followed by thousands while the bells of all the churches tolled Nothing like this had ever before 
happened in Knigsberg say the chroniclers  

It is difficult to account for this astonishing upsurge of popular feeling Was it due solely to Kants reputation as a 
great philosopher and a good man It seems to me that there was more in it than this and I suggest that in the year 
 under the absolute monarchy of Frederick William those bells tolling for Kant carried an echo of the American 
and French revolutions of the ideas of  and  I suggest that to his countrymen Kant had become an 

embodiment of these ideas  They came to show their gratitude to a teacher of the Rights of Man of equality before 
the law of world citizenship of peace on earth and perhaps most important of emancipation through knowledge  

 

 Six years before Kants death Porschke reports see his letter to Fichte of nd July  that owing to Kants 
retired way of life he was being forgotten even in Knigsberg 
 C EACh Wasianski Immanuel Kant in seinen letzten Lebensjahren from Ueber Immanuel Kant 
Dritter Band Knigsberg bei Nicolovius  The public newspapers and a special 
publication have made Kants funeral known in all its circumstances 
 Kants sympathies with the ideas of  and  were well known for he used to express them in public Cf 
Motherbys eyewitness report on Kants first meeting with Green in R B Jachmann Immanuel Kant 
geschildert in BriefenUeber Immanuel Kant Zweiter Band Knigsberg bei Nicolovius 
 
 I say most important because Kants welldeserved rise from near poverty to fame and comparatively easy 
circumstances helped to create on the Continent the idea of emancipation through selfeducation in this form 
hardly known in England where the selfmade man was the uncultured upstart The significance of this idea is 
connected with the fact that on the Continent the educated had been for a long time the middle classes while in 
England they were the upper classes 

 

 

 KANT AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 

Most of these ideas had reached the Continent from England in the form of a book published in  I mean 
Voltaire Letters about the English In this book Voltaire contrasts English constitutional government with 
Continental absolute monarchy English religious toleration with the attitude of the Roman Church and the 
explanatory power of Newtons cosmology and of Lockes analytic empiricism with the dogmatism of Descartes 
Voltaires book was burnt but its publication marks the beginning of a philosophical movementa movement whose 
peculiar mood of intellectual aggressiveness was little understood in England where there was no occasion for it 

Sixty years after Kants death these same English ideas were being presented to the English as a shallow and 
pretentious intellectualism and ironically enough the English word Enlightenment which was then used to name the 
movement started by Voltaire is still beset by this connotation of shallowness and pretentiousness this at least is 
what the Oxford English Dictionary tells us  I need hardly add that no such connotation is intended when I use 
the word Enlightenment 

Kant believed in the Enlightenment He was its last great defender I realize that this is not the usual view While I see 
Kant as the defender of the Enlightenment he is more often taken as the founder of the school which destroyed itof 
the Romantic School of Fichte Schelling and Hegel I contend that these two interpretations are incompatible 

Fichte and later Hegel tried to appropriate Kant as the founder of their school But Kant lived long enough to reject 
the persistent advances of Fichte who proclaimed himself Kants successor and heir In A Public Declaration 
Concerning Fichte  which is too little known Kant wrote May God protect us from our friends    For there are 
fraudulent and perfidious socalled friends who are scheming for our ruin while speaking the language of goodwill It 

was only after Kants death when he could no longer protest that this worldcitizen was successfully pressed into the 
service of the nationalistic Romantic School in spite of all his warnings against romanti 

 

 The OED says some of the italics are mine Enlightenment     Sometimes used after the German 
Aufklrung Aufklrerei  to designate the spirit and the aims of the French Philosophers of the th century 
or others whom it is intended to associate with them in the implied charge of shallow and 
pretentious intellectualism unreasonable contempt of tradition and authority etc The OED does not 
mention that Aufklrung is a translation of the French claircissement and that it does not have these 
connotations in German while Aufklrerei or Aufklricht are disparaging neologisms invented and 
exclusively used by the Romantics the enemies of the Enlightenment The OED quotes J H Stirling The 
Secret of Hegel  and Caird The Philosophy of Kant  as users of the word in sense

vol VIII pp  f and my Open Society note  to ch   th edn  vol II p  

 

 

cism sentimental enthusiasm and Schwrmerei But let us see how Kant himself describes the idea of the 
Enlightenment  

Enlightenment is the emancipation of man from a state of selfimposed tutelage    of incapacity to 
use his own intelligence without external guidance Such a state of tutelage I call selfimposed if it is 
due not to lack of intelligence but to lack of courage or determination to use ones own intelligence 
without the help of a leader Sapere aude Dare to use your own intelligence This is the battlecry 
of the Enlightenment 

Kant is saying something very personal here It is part of his own history Brought up in near poverty in the narrow 
outlook of Pietisma severe German version of Puritanismhis own life was a story of emancipation through 
knowledge In later years he used to look back with horror to what he called  the slavery of childhood his period of 
tutelage One might well say that the dominant theme of his whole life was the struggle for spiritual freedom 

 KANTS NEWTONIAN COSMOLOGY 

A decisive role in this struggle was played by Newtons theory which had been made known on the Continent by 
Voltaire The cosmology of Copernicus and Newton became the powerful and exciting inspiration of Kants intellectual 
life His first important book  The Theory of the Heavens has the interesting subtitle An Essay on the 
Constitution and the Mechanical Origin of the Universe Treated According to Newtonian 
Principles It is one of the greatest contributions ever made to cosmology and cosmogony It contains the first 
formulation not only of what is now called the  KantLaplace hypothesis of the origin of the solar system but also 
anticipating Jeans an application of this idea to the Milky Way which Thomas Wright had interpreted as a stellar 
system five years earlier But all this is excelled by Kants identification of the nebulae as other Milky Waysdistant 
stellar systems similar to our own 

It was the cosmological problem as Kant explains in one of his letters  which led him to his theory of knowledge 
and to his Critique of Pure Reason He was concerned with the knotty problem which has to be faced by every 

 
 To C Garve st September  My starting point was not an investigation into the existence of God but the 
antinomy of pure reason The world has a beginning it has no beginning etc down to the fourth    Here 
comes a place where Kant apparently mixes up his third and fourth antinomies It was these antinomies which 
first stirred me from my dogmatic slumber and drove me to the critique of reason    in order to resolve the 
scandal of the apparent contradiction of reason with itself

cosmologist of the finitude or infinity of the universe with respect to both space and time As far as space is 
concerned a fascinating solution has been suggested since by Einstein in the form of a world which is both finite and 
without limits This solution cuts right through the Kantian knot but it uses more powerful means than those available 
to Kant and his contemporaries As far as time is concerned no equally promising solution of Kants difficulties has 
been offered up to now 

 THE CRITIQUE AND THE COSMOLOGICAL PROBLEM 

Kant tells us  that he came upon the central problem of his Critique when considering whether the universe had a 
beginning in time or not He found to his dismay that he could produce seemingly valid proofs for both of these 
possibilities The two proofs  are interesting it needs concentration to follow them but they are not long and not 
hard to understand 

For the first proof we start by analysing the idea of an infinite sequence of years or days or any other equal and 
finite intervals of time Such an infinite sequence of years must be a sequence which goes on and on and never 
comes to an end It can never be completed a completed or an elapsed infinity of years is a contradiction in terms 
Now in his first proof Kant simply argues that the world must have a beginning in time since otherwise at this present 
moment an infinite number of years must have elapsed which is impossible This concludes the first proof 

For the second proof we start by analysing the idea of a completely empty timethe time before there was a world 
Such an empty time in which there is nothing whatever must be a time none of whose timeintervals is differentiated 
from any other by its temporal relation to things and events since things and events simply do not exist at all Now 
take the last interval of the empty timethe one immediately before the world begins Clearly this interval is 
differentiated from all earlier intervals since it is characterized by its close temporal relation to an eventthe beginning 
of the world yet the same interval is supposed to be empty which is a contradiction in terms Now in his second 

proof Kant simply argues that the world cannot have a beginning in time since otherwise there would be a time
intervalthe moment immediately before the world beganwhich is empty and yet characterized by its immediate 
temporal relation to an event in the world which is impossible 

We have here a clash between two proofs Such a clash Kant called an antinomy I shall not trouble you with the 
other antinomies in which Kant found himself entangled such as those concerning the limits of the universe in space

 SPACE AND TIME 

What lesson did Kant draw from these bewildering antinomies He concluded  that our ideas of space and time are 
inapplicable to the universe as a whole We can of course apply the ideas of space and time to ordinary physical 
things and physical events But space and time themselves are neither things nor events they cannot even be 
observed they are more elusive They are a kind of framework for things and events something like a system of 
pigeonholes or a filing system for observations Space and time are not part of the real empirical world of things 
and events but rather part of our mental outfit our apparatus for grasping this world Their proper use is as 
instruments of observation in observing any event we locate it as a rule immediately and intuitively in an order of 
space and time Thus space and time may be described as a frame of reference which is not based upon experience 
but intuitively used in experience and properly applicable to experience This is why we get into trouble if we 
misapply the ideas of space and time by using them in a field which transcends all possible experienceas we did in 
our two proofs about the universe as a whole 

To the view which I have just outlined Kant chose to give the ugly and doubly misleading name Transcendental 
Idealism He soon regretted this choice  for it made people believe that he was an idealist in the sense of denying 
the reality of physical things that he declared physical things to be mere ideas Kant hastened to explain that he had 
only denied that space and time are empirical and realempirical and real in the sense in which physical things and 
events are empirical and real But in vain did he protest His difficult style sealed his fate he was to be revered as the 
father of German Idealism I suggest that it is time to put this right Kant always insisted  that the physical things in 
space and time are real And as to the wild and obscure metaphysical speculations of the German Idealists the very 
title of Kant Critique was chosen to announce a critical attack upon all such speculative reasoning For what the 
Critique criticizes is pure reason it criticizes and attacks all reasoning about the world that is pure in the sense of 
being untainted by sense experience Kant attacked pure reason by showing that pure reasoning about the world 
must always entangle us in antinomies Stimulated by Hume Kant wrote his Critique in order to establish  that the

use for its principles are continuously submitted to tests being tested by the touchstone of experience Similarly 
there is no need for it within the field of mathematics where its conceptions must be presented at once in pure 
intuition of space and time    But in a field in which reason is constrained neither by senseexperience nor by 
pure intuition to follow a visible tracknamely in the field of its transcendental use    there is much need 
to discipline reason so that its tendency to overstep the narrow limits of possible experience 
may be subdued   

 

 

limits of sense experience are the limits of all sound reasoning about the world 

 KANTS COPERNICAN REVOLUTION 

Kants faith in his theory of space and time as an intuitive frame of reference was confirmed when he found in it a key 
to the solution of a second problem This was the problem of the validity of Newtonian theory in whose absolute and 
unquestionable truth he believed  in common with all concontemporary physicists It was inconceivable he felt 
that this exact mathematical theory should be nothing but the result of accumulated observations But what else could 
be its basis Kant approached this problem by first considering the status of geometry Euclids geometry is not 
based upon observation he said but upon our intuition of spatial relations Newtonian science is in a similar position 
Although confirmed by observations it is the result not of these observations but of our own ways of thinking of our 
attempts to order our sensedata to understand them and to digest them intellectually It is not these sensedata but 
our own intellect the organization of the digestive system of our mind which is responsible for our theories Nature 
as we know it with its order and with its laws is thus largely a product of the assimilating and ordering activities of 
our mind In Kants own striking formulation of this view  Our intellect does not draw its laws from nature but 
imposes its laws upon nature 

This formula sums up an idea which Kant himself proudly calls his Copernican Revolution As Kant puts it 
Copernicus  finding that no progress was being made with the theory of the revolving heavens broke the deadlock 
by turning the tables as it were he assumed that it is not the heavens which revolve while we the observers stand 
still but that we the observers revolve while the heavens stand still In a similar way Kant says the problem of 
scientific knowledge is to be solvedthe problem how an exact science such as Newtonian theory is possible and 
how it could ever have been found We must give up the view that we are passive observers waiting for nature to 

 

 See for example Kant Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science   containing the a priori 
demonstration of Newtonian mechanics See also the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Critique of 
Practical Reason I have tried to show elsewhere chapter  of this volume that some of the greatest 
difficulties in Kant are due to the tacit assumption that Newtonian Science is demonstrably true that it is 
epistm and that with the realization that this is not so one of the most fundamental problems of the 
Critique dissolves See also ch  below 
 See Prolegomena end of section  Kants footnote referring to Crusius is interesting it 
suggests that Kant had an inkling of the analogy between what he called his Copernican 
Revolution and his principle of autonomy in ethics 

 My text here is a free translation from the Critique of Pure Reason nd edn pp xvi f 

 

 

impress its regularity upon us Instead we must adopt the view that in digesting our sensedata we actively impress 
the order and the laws of our intellect upon them Our cosmos bears the imprint of our minds 

By emphasizing the role played by the observer the investigator the theorist Kant made an indelible impression not 
only upon philosophy but also upon physics and cosmology There is a Kantian climate of thought without which 
Einsteins theories or Bohrs are hardly conceivable and Eddington might be said to be more of a Kantian in some 
respects than Kant himself Even those who like myself cannot follow Kant all the way can accept his view that the 
experimenter must not wait till it pleases nature to reveal her secrets but that he must question her  He must cross
examine nature in the light of his doubts his conjectures his theories his ideas and his inspirations Here I believe 
is a wonderful philosophical find It makes it possible to look upon science whether theoretical or experimental as a 
human creation and to look upon its history as part of the history of ideas on a level with the history of art or of 
literature 

There is a second and even more interesting meaning inherent in Kants version of the Copernican Revolution a 
meaning which may perhaps indicate an ambivalence in his attitude towards it For Kants Copernican Revolution 
solves a human problem to which Copernicus own revolution gave rise Copernicus deprived man of his central 
position in the physical universe Kants Copernican Revolution takes the sting out of this He shows us not only that 
our location in the physical universe is irrelevant but also that in a sense our universe may well be said to turn about 
us for it is we who produce at least in part the order we find in it it is we who create our knowledge of it We are 
discoverers and discovery is a creative art 

 THE DOCTRINE OF AUTONOMY 

From Kant the cosmologist the philosopher of knowledge and of science I now turn to Kant the moralist I do not 
know whether it has been noticed before that the fundamental idea of Kants ethics amounts to another Copernican 
Revolution analogous in every respect to the one I have described For Kant makes man the lawgiver of morality just 
as he makes him the lawgiver of nature And in doing so he gives back to man his central place both in his moral and 
in his physical universe Kant humanized ethics as he had humanized science 

Kants Copernican Revolution in the field of ethics  is contained in his doctrine of autonomythe doctrine that we 
cannot accept the command of an authority however exalted as the ultimate basis of ethics For whenever 

 
 Op cit pp xii f cf especially the passage The physicists    realized that they    had to compel Nature to 
reply to their questions rather than let themselves be tied to her apronstrings as it were 
 See the Grundlegung zur Met d Sitten nd section  WWC pp  ff especially  ff 
The Autonomy of the Will as the Highest Principle of Morality and the rd section  WWC 
pp  ff 

 

 

we are faced with a command by an authority it is our responsibility to judge whether this command is moral or 
immoral The authority may have power to enforce its commands and we may be powerless to resist But if we have 
the physical power of choice then the ultimate responsibility remains with us It is our decision whether to obey a 
command whether to accept authority 

Kant boldly carries this revolution into the field of religion Here is a striking passage  

Much as my words may startle you you must not condemn me for saying every man creates his 
God From the moral point of view    you even have to create your God in order to worship in Him 
your creator For in whatever way    the Deity should be made known to you and even    if He 
should reveal Himself to you it is you    who must judge whether you are permitted by your 
conscience to believe in Him and to worship Him 

Kants ethical theory is not confined to the statement that a mans conscience is his moral authority He also tries to 
tell us what our conscience may demand from us Of this the moral law he gives several formulations One of them 
is  Always regard every man as an end in himself and never use him merely as a means to your ends The spirit 
of Kants ethics may well be summed up in these words dare to be free and respect the freedom of others 

Upon the basis of these ethics Kant erected his most important theory of the state  and his theory of international 
law He demanded  a league of nations or a federal union of states which ultimately was to proclaim and to 
maintain eternal peace on earth 

I have tried to sketch in broad outline Kants philosophy of man and his world and its two main inspirations
Newtonian cosmology and the ethics of freedom the two inspirations to which Kant referred when he spoke  of the 
starry heavens above us and the moral law within us 

Stepping back further to get a still more distant view of Kants historical role we may compare him with Socrates 
Both were accused of perverting the state religion and of corrupting the minds of the young Both denied the charge 
and both stood up for freedom of thought Freedom meant more to them than absence of constraint it was for both a 
way of life

free because he is selfsufficient who is not in need of constraint because he is able to rule himself and to accept 
freely the rule of law 

To this Socratic idea of selfsufficiency which forms part of our western heritage Kant has given a new meaning in 
the fields of both knowledge and morals And he has added to it further the idea of a community of free menof all 
men For he has shown that every man is free not because he is born free but because he is born with the burden of 
responsibility for free decision 

 

  
ON THE STATUS OF SCIENCE AND OF METAPHYSICS 
 KANT AND THE LOGIC OF EXPERIENCE 

IN this talk I do not propose to speak of ordinary everyday experience I intend rather to use the word experience in 
the sense in which we use it when we say that science is based on experience Since however experience in 
science is after all no more than an extension of ordinary everyday experience what I shall have to say will apply by 
and large to everyday experience also 

In order not to get lost in abstractions I intend to discuss the logical status of a specific empirical scienceNewtonian 
dynamics I do not however presuppose any knowledge of physics on the part of my audience 

One of the things a philosopher may do and one of those that may rank among his highest achievements is to see a 
riddle a problem or a paradox not previously seen by anyone else This is an even greater achievement than 
resolving the riddle The philosopher who first sees and understands a new problem disturbs our laziness and 
complacency He does to us what Hume did for Kant he rouses us from our dogmatic slumber He opens out a new 
horizon before us 

The first philosopher clearly to apprehend the riddle of natural science was Kant I do not know of any 
philosopher either before or since who has been so profoundly stirred by it 

When Kant talked of natural science he almost invariably had Isaac Newtons celestial mechanics in mind Kant 
himself made important contributions to Newtonian physics and he was one of the greatest cosmologists of all time 
His two principal cosmological works are the Natural History and Theory of the Heavens   and the 
Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science   Both themes were in Kants own words treated 
according to Newtonian Principles  

 

 Also of great importance is the Latin Physical Monadology of  in which Kant anticipated the main idea of 
Boscovic but in his work of  Kant repudiated the theory of matter propounded in his Monadology 

 

 

Like almost all of his contemporaries who were knowledgeable in this field Kant believed in the truth of Newtons 
celestial mechanics The almost universal belief that Newtons theory must be true was not only understandable but 
seemed to be wellfounded Never had there been a better theory nor one more severely tested Newtons theory not 
only accurately predicted the orbits of all the planets including their deviations from Keplers ellipses but also the 
orbits of all their satellites Moreover its few simple principles supplied at the same time a celestial mechanics and a 
terrestrial mechanicsHere was a universally valid system of the world that described the laws of cosmic motion in the 
simplest and clearest way possibleand with absolute accuracy Its principles were as simple and precise as geometry 
itselfas Euclids supreme achievement that unsurpassed model of all science Newton had indeed propounded a kind 
of cosmic geometry consisting of Euclid supplemented by a theory which too could be represented geometrically of 
the motion of masspoints under the influence of forces It added apart from the concept of time only two essentially 
new concepts to Euclidian geometry the concept of mass or of a material masspoint and the even more 
important concept of a directed force vis in Latin and dynamis in Greek from which the name dynamics for 
Newtons theory is derivedHere then was a science of the cosmos of nature and it was claimed a science based 
upon experience It was a deductive science exactly like geometry Yet Newton himself asserted that he had wrested 
its functional principles from experience by induction In other words Newton asserted that the truth of his theory 
could be logically derived from the truth of certain observationstatements Although he did not describe these 
observationstatements precisely it is nevertheless clear that he must have been referring to Keplers laws the laws of 
the elliptic motions of the planets And we can still find prominent physicists who maintain that Keplers laws can be 
derived inductively from observationstatements and that Newtons principles can in turn be derived entirely or 
almost entirely from Keplers lawsIt was one of Kants greatest achievements that roused by Hume he recognized 
that this contention was paradoxical Kant saw more clearly than anyone before or since how absurd it was to 
assume that Newtons theory could be derived from observations Since this important insight of Kants is falling into 
oblivion partly because of his own contributions towards a solution of the problem he had discovered I will now 
present and discuss it in detailThe assertion that Newtons theory was derived from observation will be criticized here 
on three counts 

First the assertion is intuitively not credible especially when we compare the character of the theory 
with the character of observationstatements 
Secondly the assertion is historically false 
Thirdly the assertion is logically false it is a logically impossible assertion 

Let us examine the first pointthat it is intuitively not credible that observations can show Newtons mechanics to be 
true 

 

 

To see this we merely have to remember how utterly Newtonian theory differs from any observationstatement In the 
first place observations are always inexact while the theory makes absolutely exact assertions Moreover it was 
one of the triumphs of Newtonian theory that it stood up to subsequent observations which as regards precision went 
far beyond what could be attained in Newtons own time Now it is incredible that more precise statements let alone 
the absolutely precise statements of the theory itself could be logically derived from less exact or inexact ones  But 
even if we forget all about the question of precision we should realize that an observation is always made under very 
special conditions and that each observed situation is always a highly specific situation The theory on the other 
hand claims to apply in all possible circumstancesnot only to the planets Mars or Jupiter or even to the satellites in 
the solar system but to all planetary motion and to all solar systems Indeed its claims go far beyond all this For 
example the theory makes assertions about gravitational pressure inside the stars assertions which even today have 
never been tested by observation Moreover observations are always concrete while theory is abstract For 
example we never observe mass points but rather extended planets This may perhaps not be so very important but 
what is of the utmost importance is that we can neverI repeat neverobserve anything like Newtonian forces 
Admittedly since forces are so defined that they may be measured by measuring accelerations we can indeed 
measure forces and we may at times measure a force not by measuring an acceleration but for instance with the 
help of a spring balance Yet in all these measurements without exception we always presuppose 
the truth of Newtonian dynamics Without the prior assumption of a dynamical theory it is simply impossible to 
measure forces But forces and changes of forces are among the most important things of which the theory treats 
Thus we may assert that at least some of the objects of which the theory treats are abstract and unobservable 
objects For all these reasons it is intuitively not credible that the theory should be logically derivable from 
observations 

This result would not be affected even if it were possible so to reformulate Newtons theory that any reference to 
forces was avoided Nor would it be affected by a dismissal of force as a mere fiction or perhaps as a purely 
theoretical construction which serves only as a tool or instrument For the thesis which we are questioning says that 
Newtons theory can be shown to be true by observation And our objection was that we can only observe concrete 
things while theory and particularly Newtonian forces are abstract These difficulties are in no way mitigated if 
we make the theory even more abstract by eliminating the notion of force or by unmasking it as a mere auxiliary 
construction 

So much for my first point 

My second point was that it is historically false to believe that Newtons 

 

 A similar consideration may be found in Bertrand Russell The Analysis of Mind  pp  f 

 

dynamics was derived from observation Though this belief is widespread it is nevertheless a belief in a historical 
mythor if you like a bold distortion of history To show this I shall briefly refer to the part played by the three most 
important precursors of Newton in this field Nicolaus Copernicus Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler 

Copernicus studied in Bologna under the Platonist Novara and Copernicus idea of placing the sun rather than the 
earth in the centre of the universe was not the result of new observations but of a new interpretation of old and 
wellknown facts in the light of semireligious Platonic and NeoPlatonic ideas The crucial idea can be traced back to 
the sixth book of Plato Republic where we can read that the sun plays the same role in the realm of visible things 
as does the idea of the good in the realm of ideas Now the idea of the good is the highest in the hierarchy of Platonic 
ideas Accordingly the sun which endows visible things with their visibility vitality growth and progress is the highest 
in the hierarchy of the visible things in nature 

This passage in the Republic is of outstanding importance among the passages upon which NeoPlatonic 
philosophyand particularly Christian NeoPlatonic philosophywas based 

Now if the sun was to be given pride of place if the sun merited a divine status in the hierarchy of visible things then 
it was hardly possible for it to revolve about the earth The only fitting place for so exalted a star was the centre of the 
universe  So the earth was bound to revolve about the sun 

This Platonic idea then forms the historical background of the Copernican revolution It does not start with 
observations but with a religious or mythological idea Such beautiful but wild ideas have often been put forward by 
great thinkers and just as often by cranks But Copernicus for one was not a crank He was highly critical of his own 
mystical intuitions which he rigorously examined in the light of astronomical observations reinterpreted with the aid of 
the new idea He rightly considered these observations to be extremely important Yet looked at from a historical or 
genetical point of view observations were not the source of his idea The idea came first and it was indispensable for 
the interpretation of the observations they had to be interpreted in its light 

Johannes Keplerthe pupil and assistant of Tycho Brahe to whom that great teacher left his unpublished 
observationswas a Copernican Like Plato himself Kepler though always a critical thinker was steeped in 
astrological lore and he also was like Plato deeply influenced by the numbermysticism of the Pythagoreans What he 
hoped to discover what he searched for throughout his life was the arithmetical law underlying the structure of the 
world the law upon which rested the construction of the circles of Copernicus solar system and upon which in 
particular their relative 

 

 Cp Aristotle De Caelo b where the doctrine that the centre of the universe is precious 
and therefore to be occupied by a central fire is criticized and ascribed to the 
Pythagoreans which perhaps means his rivals the successors of Plato who stayed in the 
Academy 

 

 

 

distances from the sun were based He never found what he sought He did not find in Tychos observations the 
hopedfor confirmation of his belief that Mars revolved about the sun in a perfectly circular orbit with uniform velocity 
On the contrary he discovered in Tychos observations a refutation of the circle hypothesis Thus he discarded the 
circle hypothesis and having tried in vain various other solutions he hit upon the next best thing the hypothesis of 
the ellipse And he found that the observations could be made to agree with the new hypothesisalthough only under 
the assumption at first far from welcome that Mars did not travel with uniform velocity 

Historically therefore Keplers laws were not the result of observations What happened was that Kepler tried in vain 
to interpret Tychos observations by means of his original circle hypothesis The observations refuted this 
hypothesis and so he tried the next best solutionsthe oval and the ellipse The observations still did not prove that 
the hypothesis of an ellipse was correct but they could now be explained by means of this hypothesis they could 
be reconciled with it 

Moreover Keplers laws partly support and are partly inspired by his belief in a cause a power emanating like light 
rays from the sun and influencing steering or causing the movement of the planets including the earth But the view 
that there is an influx or Influence from the stars reaching the earth was at the time considered as the fundamental 
tenet of astrology as opposed to Aristotelian rationalism Here we have an important dividing line which separated 
two schools of thought Galileo for example the great critic of Aristotle or Descartes or Boyle or Newton belonged 
to the Aristotelian rationalist tradition This is why Galileo remained sceptical of Keplers views and also why he was 
unable to accept any theory of the tides which explained them by the influence of the moon so that he felt compelled 
to develop a nonlunar theory which explained the tides merely by the motion of the earth This is also why Newton 
was so reluctant to accept his own theory of attraction or Robert Hookes and why he was never quite reconciled to 
it And this is why the French Cartesians were so long unwilling to accept Newtons theory But in the end the 
originally astrological view proved so successful that it was accepted by all rationalists and its disreputable origin was 
forgotten  

Such from an historical and genetical point of view were the main antecedents of Newtons theory Our story shows 
that as a matter of historical fact the theory was not derived from observations 

Kant realized much of this and he also appreciated the fact that even physical experiments are not genetically prior 
to theoriesno more than are astronomical observations They too simply represent crucial questions which 

 

 I think that Arthur Koestlers criticism of Galileo in his remarkable book The Sleepwalkers suffers from the 
fact that he does not take into account the schism described here Galileo was as justified in trying to see whether 
he could not solve the problems within the rationalist framework as was Kepler in his attempts to solve them 
within the astrological framework See also for the influence of astrological ideas note  to ch  of the present 
volume 

 

 

man poses to nature with the help of theoriesjust as Kepler asked nature whether his circle hypothesis was true 
Thus Kant wrote in the preface to the nd edition of the Critique of Pure Reason 

When Galileo let his balls run down an inclined plane with a gravity which he had chosen himself 
when Torricelli caused the air to sustain a weight which he had calculated beforehand to be equal to 
that of a column of water of known height    then a light dawned upon all natural philosophers They 
learnt that our reason can understand only what it creates according to its own design that 
we must compel Nature to answer our questions rather than cling to Natures apron strings 
and allow her to guide us For purely accidental observations made without any plan 
having been thought out in advance cannot be connected by a    lawwhich is 
what reason is searching for  

This quotation from Kant shows how well he understood that we ourselves must confront nature with hypotheses and 
demand a reply to our questions and that lacking such hypotheses we can only make haphazard observations 
which follow no plan and which can therefore never lead us to a natural law In other words Kant saw with perfect 
clarity that the history of science had refuted the Baconian myth that we must begin with observations in order to 
derive our theories from them And Kant also realized very clearly that behind this historical fact lay a logical fact that 
there were logical reasons why this kind of thing did not occur in the history of science that it was logically impossible 
to derive theories from observations 

My third pointthe contention that it is logically impossible to derive Newtons theory from observationsfollows 
immediately from Humes critique of the validity of inductive inferences as pointed out by Kant Humes decisive point 
may be put as follows 

Take a class consisting of any number of true observationstatements and designate it by the letter K Then 
statements in the class K will describe actual observations ie past observations thus we designate by the letter K 
any class whatsoever of true statements about observations actually made in the past Since we have assumed that 
K consists only of true statements all statements in the class K must also be consistent statements and 
furthermore all statements belonging to the class K must be compatible with one another Now take a further 
observationstatement which we shall designate by the letter B We assume that B describes some future 
logically possible observation for example that B tells us that there will be an eclipse of the sun tomorrow 
Since eclipses of the sun have already been observed we can be certain that a statement B asserting that there will 
be an eclipse of the sun tomorrow is a statement which on purely logical grounds is possible that is to say our B 
is selfconsistent Now Hume shows the following if B is a selfconsistent observationstatement about a possible 
future event and K any class of true observationstatements about past events then B can always be conjoined 
with K without contradiction or in other words if we add a statement B about a possible future event to statements 
in K we can never arrive 

 

 The original has no italics 

 

 

at a logical contradiction Humes finding can also be formulated as follows no logically possible future 
observation can ever contradict the class of past observations 

Let us now add to Humes simple finding a theorem of pure logic namely whenever a statement B can be conjoined 
without contradiction to a class of statements K then it can also be conjoined without contradiction to any class of 
statements that consists of statements of K together with any statement that can be derived from K 

And so we have proved our point if Newtons theory could be derived from a class K of true observationstatements 
then no future observation B could possibly contradict Newtons theory and the observations K 

Yet it is known on the other hand that from Newtons theory and past observations we can logically derive a 
statement that tells us whether or not there will be an eclipse of the sun tomorrow Now if this derived statement tells 
us that tomorrow there will be no eclipse of the sun then our B is clearly incompatible with Newtons theory and 
the class K From this and our previous results it follows logically that it is impossible to assume that Newtons theory 
can be derived from observations 

Thus we have proved our third point And we can now see the whole riddle of experiencethe paradox of the empirical 
sciences as discovered by Kant 

Newtons dynamics goes essentially beyond all observations It is universal exact and abstract 
it arose historically out of myths and we can show by purely logical means that it is not 
derivable from observationstatements 

Kant also showed that what holds for Newtonian theory must hold for everyday experience though not perhaps 
to quite the same extent that everyday experience too goes far beyond all observation Everyday experience too 
must interpret observation for without theoretical interpretation observation remains blinduninformative Everyday 
experience constantly operates with abstract ideas such as that of cause and effect and so it cannot be derived from 
observations 

In order to solve the riddle of experience and to explain how natural science and experience are at all possible Kant 
constructed his theory of experience and of natural science I admire this theory as a truly heroic attempt to 
solve the paradox of experience yet I believe that it answers a false question and hence that it is in part irrelevant 
Kant the great discoverer of the riddle of experience was in error about one important point But his error I hasten to 
add was quite unavoidable and it detracts in no way from his magnificent achievement 

What was this error As I have said Kant like almost all philosophers and epistemologists right into the twentieth 
century was convinced that Newtons theory was true This conviction was inescapable Newtons theory had made 
the most astonishing and exact predictions all of which had proved strikingly correct Only ignorant men could doubt 
its truth How little we may reproach Kant for his belief is best shown by the fact that even Henri Poincar the 

 

 

greatest mathematician physicist and philosopher of his generation who died shortly before the First World War 
believed like Kant that Newtons theory was true and irrefutable Poincar was one of the few scientists who felt about 
Kants paradox almost as strongly as Kant himself and though he proposed a solution which differed somewhat from 
Kants it was only a variant of it The important point however is that he fully shared Kants error as I have called it 
It was an unavoidable errorunavoidable that is before Einstein 

Even those who do not accept Einsteins theory of gravitation ought to admit that his was an achievement of truly 
epochmaking significance For his theory established at least that Newtons theory no matter whether true or false 
was certainly not the only possible system of celestial mechanics that could explain the phenomena in a simple 
and convincing way For the first time in more than  years Newtons theory became problematical It had 
become during these two centuries a dangerous dogmaa dogma of almost stupefying power I have no objection 
to those who oppose Einsteins theory on scientific grounds But even Einsteins opponents like his greatest 
admirers ought to be grateful to him for having freed physics of the paralysing belief in the incontestible truth of 
Newtons theory Thanks to Einstein we now look upon this theory as a hypothesis or a system of hypotheses
perhaps the most magnificent and the most important hypothesis in the history of science and certainly an 
astonishing approximation to the truth  

Now if unlike Kant we consider Newtons theory as a hypothesis whose truth is problematic then we must radically 
alter Kants problem No wonder then that his solution no longer suits the new postEinsteinian formulation of the 
problem and that it must be amended accordingly 

Kants solution of the problem is well known He assumed correctly I think that the world as we know it is our 
interpretation of the observable facts in the light of theories that we ourselves invent As Kant puts 
it Our intellect does not draw its laws from nature    but imposes them upon nature While I regard this formulation 
of Kants as essentially correct I feel that it is a little too radical and I should therefore like to put it in the following 
modified form Our intellect does not draw its laws from nature but trieswith varying degrees of successto impose 
upon nature laws which it freely invents The difference is this Kants formulation not only implies that our reason 
attempts to impose laws upon nature but also that it is invariably successful in this For Kant believed that Newtons 
laws were successfully imposed upon nature by us that we were bound to interpret nature by means of these laws 
from which he concluded that they must be true a priori This is how Kant saw these matters and Poincar saw 
them in a similar way 

Yet we know since Einstein that very different theories and very different 

 

 See Einsteins own formulation in his Herbert Spencer lecture  On the Method of Theoretical Physics 
 p  where he writes It was the general Theory of Relativity which showed    that it was possible for us 
using basic principles very far removed from those of Newton to do justice to the entire range of the data of 
experience    

 

 

interpretations are also possible and that they may even be superior to Newtons Thus reason is capable of more 
than one interpretation Nor can it impose its interpretation upon nature once and for all time Reason works by trial 
and error We invent our myths and our theories and we try them out we try to see how far they take us And we 
improve our theories if we can The better theory is the one that has the greater explanatory power that explains 
more that explains with greater precision and that allows us to make better predictions 

Since Kant believed that it was our task to explain the uniqueness and the truth of Newtons theory he was led to the 
belief that this theory followed inescapably and with logical necessity from the laws of our understanding The 
modification of Kants solution which I propose in accordance with the Einsteinian revolution frees us from this 
compulsion In this way theories are seen to be the free creations of our own minds the result of an almost poetic 
intuition of an attempt to understand intuitively the laws of nature But we no longer try to force our creations upon 
nature On the contrary we question nature as Kant taught us to do and we try to elicit from her negative answers 
concerning the truth of our theories we do not try to prove or to verify them but we test them by trying to disprove 
or to falsify them to refute them 

In this way the freedom and boldness of our theoretical creations can be controlled and tempered by selfcriticism 
and by the severest tests we can design It is here through our critical methods of testing that scientific rigour and 
logic enter into empirical science 

We have seen that theories cannot be logically derived from observations They can however clash with 
observations they can contradict observations This fact makes it possible to infer from observations that a theory is 
false The possibility of refuting theories by observations is the basis of all empirical tests For the test of a theory is 
like every rigorous examination always an attempt to show that the candidate is mistakenthat is that the theory 
entails a false assertion From a logical point of view all empirical tests are therefore attempted refutations 

In conclusion I should like to say that ever since Laplace attempts have been made to attribute to our theories instead 
of truth at least a high degree of probability I regard these attempts as misconceived All we can ever hope to 
say of a theory is that it explains this or that that it has been tested severely and that it has stood up to all our tests 
We may also compare say two theories in order to see which of them has stood up better to our severest testsor in 
other words which of them is better corroborated by the results of our tests But it can be shown by purely 
mathematical means that degree of corroboration can never be equated with mathematical 
probability It can even be shown that all theories including the best have the same probability namely zero But 
the degree to which they are corroborated which in theory at least can be found out with the help of the calculus of 
probability may approach very closely to unity ie its maximum though the probability of 

 

 

the theory is zero That an appeal to probability is incapable of solving the riddle of experience is a conclusion first 
reached long ago by David Hume 

Thus logical analysis shows that experience does not consist in the mechanical accumulation of observations 
Experience is creative It is the result of free bold and creative interpretations controlled by severe criticism and 
severe tests 

 THE PROBLEM OF THE IRREFUTABILITY OF 
PHILOSOPHICAL THEORIES 

In order to avoid right from the start the danger of getting lost in generalities it might be best to explain at once with 
the help of five examples what I mean by a philosophical theory 

A typical example of a philosophical theory is Kants doctrine of determinism with respect to the world of 
experience Though Kant was an indeterminist at heart he said in the Critique of Practical Reason  that full 
knowledge of our psychological and physiological conditions and of our environment would make it possible to predict 
our future behaviour with the same certainty with which we can predict an eclipse of the sun or of the moon 

In more general terms one could formulate the determinist doctrine as follows 

The future of the empirical world or of the phenomenal world is completely predetermined by its 
present state down to its smallest detail 

Another philosophic theory is idealism in Berkeleys or Schopenhauers formulation we may express it by the 
following thesis The empirical world is my idea or The world is my dream 

A third philosophic theoryand one that is very important todayis epistemological irrationalism which might be 
explained as follows 

Since we know from Kant that human reason is incapable of grasping or knowing the world of things in themselves 
we must either give up hope of ever knowing it or else try to know it otherwise than by means of our reason and 
since we cannot and will not give up this hope we can only use irrational or suprarational means such as instinct 
poetic inspiration moods or emotions 

This irrationalists claim is possible because in the last analysis we are ourselves such thingsinthemselves thus if 
we can manage somehow to obtain an intimate and immediate knowledge of ourselves we can thereby find out what 
thingsinthemselves are like 

This simple argument of irrationalism is highly characteristic of most nineteenthcentury postKantian philosophers 
for example of the ingenious Schopenhauer who in this way discovered that since we as thingsinthemselves are 
will will must be the thinginitself The world as a thinginitself is will while the world as phenomenon is an idea 
Strangely enough this 

 

 Kritik der praktischen Vernunft th to th edn p  Works ed Cassirer vol v p  

 

obsolescent philosophy dressed up in new clothes has once again become the latest fashion although or perhaps 
just because its striking similarity to old postKantian ideas has remained hidden so far as anything may remain 
hidden under the emperors new clothes Schopenhauers philosophy is nowadays propounded in obscure and 
impressive language and his selfrevealing intuition that man as a thinginitself is ultimately will has now given 
place to the selfrevealing intuition that man may so utterly bore himself that his very boredom proves that the thingin
itself is Nothingthat it is Nothingness Emptinessinitself I do not wish to deny a certain measure of originality to 
this existentialist variant of Schopenhauers philosophy its originality is proved by the fact that Schopenhauer could 
never have thought so poorly of his powers of selfentertainment What he discovered in himself was will activity 
tension excitementroughly the opposite of what some existentialists discovered the utter boredom of the borein
himself bored by himself Yet Schopenhauer is no longer the fashion the great fashion of our postKantian and post
rationalist era is what Nietzsche haunted by premonitions and suspicious of his own progeny rightly called 
European nihilism  Yet all this is only by the way We now have before us a list of five philosophical theories 

First determinism the future is contained in the present inasmuch as it is fully determined by the present 
Second idealism the world is my dream 
Third irrationalism we have irrational or suprarational experiences in which we experience ourselves as 
thingsinthemselves and so we have some kind of knowledge of thingsinthemselves 
Fourth voluntarism in our own volitions we know ourselves as wills The thinginitself is the will 
Fifth nihilism in our boredom we know ourselves as nothings The thinginitself is Nothingness 

So much for our list I have chosen my examples in such a way that I can say of each one of these five theories after 
careful consideration that I am convinced that it is false To put it more precisely I am first of all an indeterminist 
secondly a realist thirdly a rationalist As regards my fourth and fifth examples I gladly admitwith Kant and other 
critical rationaliststhat we cannot possess anything like full knowledge of the real world with its infinite richness and 
beauty Neither physics nor any other science can help us to this end Yet I am sure the voluntarist formula The 
world is will cannot help us either And as to our nihilists and existentialists who bore themselves and perhaps 
others I can only pity them They must be blind and deaf poor 

 

 Cf Julius Kraft Von Husserl zu Heidegger nd edn  eg pp  f  f and particularly p  
where Kraft writes Thus it is hard to understand how existentialism could ever have been considered to be 
something new in philosophy from an epistemological point of view Cf also the stimulating paper by H Tint in 
the Proc Aristot Society  pp  ff 

 

 

 

things for they speak of the world like a blind man of Peruginos colours or a deaf man of Mozarts music 

Why then have I made a point of selecting for my examples a number of philosophical theories that I believe to be 
false Because I hope in this way to put more clearly the problem contained in the following important statement 

Although I consider each one of these five theories to be false I am nevertheless convinced that each of them is 
irrefutable 

Listening to this statement you may well wonder how I can possibly hold a theory to be false and irrefutable at 
one and the same timeI who claim to be a rationalist For how can a rationalist say of a theory that it is false and 
irrefutable Is he not bound as a rationalist to refute a theory before he asserts that it is false And conversely is he 
not bound to admit that if a theory is irrefutable it is true 

With these questions I have at last arrived at our problem 

The last question can be answered fairly simply There have been thinkers who believed that the truth of a theory 
may be inferred from its irrefutability Yet this is an obvious mistake considering that there may be two incompatible 
theories which are equally irrefutablefor example determinism and its opposite indeterminism Now since two 
incompatible theories cannot both be true we see from the fact that both theories are irrefutable that irrefutability 
cannot entail truth 

To infer the truth of a theory from its irrefutability is therefore inadmissible no matter how we interpret irrefutability 
For normally irrefutability would be used in the following two senses 

The first is a purely logical sense we may use irrefutable to mean the same as irrefutable by purely logical means 
But this would mean the same as consistent Now it is quite obvious that the truth of a theory cannot possibly be 
inferred from its consistency 

The second sense of irrefutable refers to refutations that make use not only of logical or analytic but also of 
empirical or synthetic assumptions in other words it admits empirical refutations In this second sense irrefutable 
means the same as not empirically refutable or more precisely compatible with any possible empirical statement or 
compatible with every possible experience 

Now both the logical and the empirical irrefutability of a statement or a theory can easily be reconciled with its 
falsehood In the case of logical irrefutability this is clear from the fact that every empirical statement and its negation 
must both be logically irrefutable For example the two statements Today is Monday and Today is not Monday 
are both logically irrefutable but from this it follows immediately that there exist false statements which are logically 
irrefutable 

With empirical irrefutability the situation is a little different The simplest examples of empirically irrefutable statements 
are socalled strict or pure existential statements Here is an example of a strict or pure existential statement There 
exists a pearl which is ten times larger than the next largest 

 

pearl If in this statement we restrict the words There exists to some finite region in space and time then it may of 
course become a refutable statement For example the following statement is obviously empirically refutable At this 
moment and in this box here there exist at least two pearls one of which is ten times larger than the next largest pearl 
in this box But then this statement is no longer a strict or pure existential statement rather it is a restricted 
existential statement A strict or pure existential statement applies to the whole universe and it is irrefutable simply 
because there can be no method by which it could be refuted For even if we were able to search our entire universe 
the strict or pure existential statement would not be refuted by our failure to discover the required pearl seeing that it 
might always be hiding in a place where we are not looking 

Examples of empirically irrefutable existential statements which are of greater interest are the following 

There exists a completely effective cure for cancer or more precisely there is a chemical compound which can be 
taken without ill effect and which cures cancer Needless to say this statement must not be interpreted as meaning 
that such a chemical compound is actually known or that it will be discovered within a given time 

Similar examples are There exists a cure for any infectious disease and There exists a Latin formula which if 
pronounced in proper ritual manner cures all diseases 

Here we have an empirically irrefutable statement that few of us would hold to be true The statement is irrefutable 
because it is obviously impossible to try out every conceivable Latin formula in combination with every conceivable 
manner of pronouncing it Thus there always remains the logical possibility that there might be after all a magical 
Latin formula with the power of curing all diseases 

Even so we are justified in believing that this irrefutable existential statement is false We certainly cannot prove its 
falsehood but everything we know about diseases tells against its being true In other words though we cannot 
establish its falsity the conjecture that there is no such magical Latin formula is much more reasonable than the 
irrefutable conjecture that such a formula does exist 

I need hardly add that through almost  years learned men have believed in the truth of an existential statement 
very much like this one this is why they persisted in their search for the philosophers stone Their failure to find it 
does not prove anythingprecisely because existential propositions are irrefutable 

Thus the logical or empirical irrefutability of a theory is certainly not a sufficient reason for holding the theory to be 
true and hence I have vindicated my right to believe at the same time that these five philosophical theories are 
irrefutable and that they are false 

Some twentyfive years ago I proposed to distinguish empirical or scientific theories from nonempirical or non
scientific ones precisely by defining the 

 

 

 

empirical theories as the refutable ones and the nonempirical theories as the irrefutable ones My reasons for this 
proposal were as follows Every serious test of a theory is an attempt to refute it Testability is therefore the same as 
refutability or falsifiability And since we should call empirical or scientific only such theories as can be empirically 
tested we may conclude that it is the possibility of an empirical refutation which distinguishes empirical or scientific 
theoriesIf this criterion of refutability is accepted then we see at once that philosophical theories or metaphysical 
theories will be irrefutable by definitionMy assertion that our five philosophical theories are irrefutable may now 
sound almost trivial At the same time it will have become obvious that though I am a rationalist I am in no way 
obliged to refute these theories before being entitled to call them false And this brings us to the crux of our problem
If philosophical theories are all irrefutable how can we ever distinguish between true and false 
philosophical theoriesThis is the serious problem which arises from the irrefutability of philosophical 
theoriesIn order to state the problem more clearly I should like to reformulate it as followsWe may distinguish here 
between three types of theory 

First logical and mathematical theories 
Second empirical and scientific theories 
Third philosophical or metaphysical theories 

How can we in each of these groups distinguish between true and false theories 

Regarding the first group the answer is obvious Whenever we find a mathematical theory of which we do not know 
whether it is true or false we test it first superficially and then more severely by trying to refute it If we are 
unsuccessful we then try to prove it or to refute its negation If we fail again doubts as to the truth of the theory may 
have cropped up again and we shall again try to refute it and so on until we either reach a decision or else shelve 
the problem as too difficult for us 

The situation could also be described as follows Our task is the testing the critical examination of two or more rival 
theories We solve it by trying to refute themeither the one or the otheruntil we come to a decision In mathematics 
but only in mathematics such decisions are generally final invalid proofs that escape detection are rare 

If we now look at the empirical sciences we find that we follow as a rule fundamentally the same procedure Once 
again we test our theories we examine them critically we try to refute them The only important difference is that now 
we can also make use of empirical arguments in our critical examinations But these empirical arguments occur only 
together with other critical considerations Critical thought as such remains our main instrument Observations are 
used only if they fit into our critical discussion 

 

 

Now if we apply these considerations to philosophical theories our problem can be reformulated as follows 

Is it possible to examine irrefutable philosophical theories critically If so what can a critical 
discussion of a theory consist of if not of attempts to refute the theory 

In other words is it possible to assess an irrefutable theory rationally which is to say critically And 
what reasonable argument can we adduce for and against a theory which we know to be neither 
demonstrable nor refutable 

In order to illustrate these various formulations of our problem by examples we may first refer again to the problem of 
determinism Kant knew perfectly well that we are unable to predict the future actions of a human being as accurately 
as we can predict an eclipse But he explained the difference by assuming that we know far less about the present 
conditions of a manabout his wishes and fears his feelings and his motivesthan about the present state of the 
solar system Now this assumption contains implicitly the following hypothesis 

There exists a true description of the present state of this man which would suffice in conjunction 
with true natural laws for the prediction of his future actions 

This is of course again a purely existential statement and it is thus irrefutable Can we in spite of this 
fact discuss Kants argument rationally and critically 

As a second example we may consider the thesis The world is my dream Though this thesis is 
clearly irrefutable few will believe in its truth But can we discuss it rationally and critically Is not its 
irrefutability an insurmountable obstacle to any critical discussion 

As to Kants doctrine of determinism it might perhaps be thought that the critical discussion of it might begin by 
saying to him My dear Kant it simply is not enough to assert that there exists a true description that is sufficiently 
detailed to enable us to predict the future What you must do is tell us exactly what this description would consist of 
so that we may test your theory empirically This speech however would be tantamount to the assumption that 
philosophicalthat is irrefutabletheories can never be discussed and that a responsible thinker is bound to 
replace them by empirically testable theories in order to make a rational discussion possible 

I hope that our problem has by now become sufficiently clear so I will now proceed to propose a solution of it 

My solution is this if a philosophical theory were no more than an isolated assertion about the world flung at us with 
an implied take it or leave it and without a hint of any connection with anything else then it would indeed be beyond 
discussion But the same might be said of an empirical theory also Should anybody present us with Newtons 
equations or even with his arguments without explaining to us first what the problems were which his theory was 
meant to solve then we should not be able to discuss its truth rationally 

 

 

 no more than the truth of the Book of Revelation Without any knowledge of the results of Galileo and Kepler of 
the problems that were resolved by these results and of Newtons problem of explaining Galileos and Keplers 
solutions by a unified theory we should find Newtons theory just as much beyond discussion as any metaphysical 
theory In other words every rational theory no matter whether scientific or philosophical is rational in so far as it 
tries to solve certain problems A theory is comprehensible and reasonable only in its relation to a given 
problemsituation and it can be rationally discussed only by discussing this relation 

Now if we look upon a theory as a proposed solution to a set of problems then the theory immediately lends itself to 
critical discussioneven if it is nonempirical and irrefutable For we can now ask questions such as Does it solve the 
problem Does it solve it better than other theories Has it perhaps merely shifted the problem Is the solution 
simple Is it fruitful Does it perhaps contradict other philosophical theories needed for solving other problems 

Questions of this kind show that a critical discussion even of irrefutable theories may well be possible 

Once again let me refer to a specific example the idealism of Berkeley or Hume which I have replaced by the 
simplified formula The world is my dream It is notable that these authors were far from wishing to offer us so 
extravagant a theory This may be seen from Berkeleys repeated insistence that his theories were really in 
agreement with sound common sense  Now if we try to understand the problem situation which induced them to 
propound this theory then we find that Berkeley and Hume believed that all our knowledge was reducible to sense
impressions and to associations between memoryimages This assumption led these two philosophers to adopt 
idealism and in the case of Hume in particular very unwillingly Hume was an idealist only because he failed in his 
attempt to reduce realism to senseimpressions 

It is therefore perfectly reasonable to criticize Humes idealism by pointing out that his sensualistic theory of 
knowledge and of learning was in any case inadequate and that there are less inadequate theories of learning which 
have no unwanted idealistic consequences 

In a similar way we could now proceed to discuss Kants determinism rationally and critically Kant was in his 
fundamental intention an indeterminist even though he believed in determinism with respect to the phenomenal world 
as an unavoidable consequence of Newtons theory he never doubted that man as a moral being was not 
determined Kant never succeeded in solving the resulting conflict between his theoretical and practical philosophy in 
a way that satisfied himself completely and he despaired of ever finding a real solution 

In the setting of this problemsituation it becomes possible to criticize 

 

 It may also be seen from Humes frank admission that whatever may be the readers opinion at this present 
moment    an hour hence he will be persuaded there is both an external and internal world  Treatise I IV 
end of section ii SelbyBigge p  

 

 

Kants determinism We may ask for example whether it really follows from Newtons theory Let us conjecture for a 
moment that it does not I do not doubt that a clear proof of the truth of this conjecture would have persuaded Kant to 
renounce his doctrine of determinismeven though this doctrine happens to be irrefutable and even though he would 
not for this very reason have been logically compelled to renounce it 

Similarly with irrationalism It first entered rational philosophy with Humeand those who have read Hume that calm 
analyst cannot doubt that this was not what he intended Irrationalism was the unintended consequence of Humes 
conviction that we do in fact learn by Baconian induction coupled with Humes logical proof that it is impossible 
rationally to justify induction So much the worse for rational justification was a conclusion which Hume of 
necessity was compelled to draw from this situation He accepted this irrational conclusion with the integrity 
characteristic of the real rationalist who does not shrink from an unpleasant conclusion if it seems to him unavoidable 

Yet in this case it was not unavoidable though it seemed to be so to Hume We are not in fact the Baconian induction 
machines that Hume believed us to be Habit or custom does not play the role in the process of learning which Hume 
assigned to it And so Humes problem dissolves and with it his irrationalist conclusions 

The situation of postKantian irrationalism is somewhat similar Schopenhauer in particular was genuinely opposed to 
irrationalism He wrote with only one desire to be understood and he wrote more lucidly than any other German 
philosopher His striving to be understood made him one of the few great masters of the German language 

Yet Schopenhauers problems were those of Kants metaphysicsthe problem of determinism in the phenomenal 
world the problem of the thinginitself and the problem of our own membership of a world of thingsinthemselves He 
solved these problemsproblems transcending all possible experiencein his typically rational manner But 
the solution was bound to be irrational For Schopenhauer was a Kantian and as such he believed in the Kantian 
limits of reason he believed that the limits of human reason coincided with the limits of possible experience 

But here again there are other possible solutions Kants problems can and must be revised and the direction that 
this revision should take is indicated by his fundamental idea of critical or selfcritical rationalism The discovery of a 
philosophical problem can be something final it is made once and for all time But the solution of a philosophical 
problem is never final It cannot be based upon a final proof or upon a final refutation this is a consequence of the 
irrefutability of philosophical theories Nor can the solution be based upon the magical formulae of inspired or bored 
philosophical prophets Yet it may be based upon the conscientious and critical examination of a problemsituation 
and its underlying assumptions and of the various possible ways of resolving it 

 

 

  
WHY ARE THE CALCULI OF LOGIC AND ARITHMETIC APPLICABLE 
TO REALITY 

PROFESSOR RYLE has confined his contribution  to the applicability of the rules of logic or more precisely to the 
logical rules of inference I intend to follow him in this and only later to extend the discussion to the applicability of 
logical and arithmetical calculi The distinction I have just made between the logical rules of inference and the 
socalled logical calculi such as the propositional calculus or the class calculus or the calculus of relations needs 
however some clarification and I shall discuss the distinction as well as the connection between the rules of 
inference and the calculi in section i before taking up the two main problems before us that of the applicability of the 
rules of inference in section ii and that of the applicability of the logical calculi in section viii 

I shall allude to and make use of some ideas from Professor Ryles paper and also from his Presidential Address to 
the Aristotelian Society Knowing How and Knowing That    

I 

Let us consider a simple example of an argument or of reasoning formulated in some language say in ordinary 
English The argument will consist of a series of statements We may assume perhaps that somebody argues  
Rachel is the mother of Richard Richard is the father of Robert The mother of the father is the paternal grandmother 
Thus Rachel is the paternal grandmother of Robert 

 

 Professor Ryles contribution to this discussion is summarized in my paper so far as is necessary to the 
understanding of my paper 
 Cp Aristotle An Post ii   and  

 

 

The word thus in the last sentence may be taken as an indication that the speaker claims that his argument is 
conclusive or valid or in other words that the last statement the conclusion has been validly drawn from the three 
foregoing statements the premises In this claim he may be right or wrong If he is usually right in claims of this 
kind then we can say that he knows how to argue And he may know how to argue without being able to explain to 
us in words the rules of the procedure which he observes in common with others who know how to argue just as a 
pianist may know how to play well without being able to explain the rules of procedure that underlie a good 
performance If a man knows how to argue without always being aware of the rules of procedure then we usually say 
that he argues or reasons intuitively And if we now read through the above argument then we may be able to say 
intuitively that the argument is valid There is little doubt that most of us reason as a rule intuitively in the sense 
indicated The formulation and discussion of the rules of procedure that underlie ordinary intuitive arguments is a 
rather specialized and sophisticated sort of inquiry it is a business peculiar to the logician While every reasonably 
intelligent man knows how to argueprovided the arguments do not become too complicatedthere are few who can 
formulate the rules which underlie these performances and which we may call rules of inference there are few who 

know that and fewer perhaps who know why a certain rule of inference is valid 

The particular rule of inference which underlies the argument stated above can be formulated making use of 
variables and a few other artificial symbols by a scheme like this  

From three premises of the form 

x R y 

y S z 

R S  T 

A conclusion may be drawn of the form x T z 

Here for x y and z any proper name of individuals may be substituted and for R S and T any names of 
relations between individuals for x R y etc any statement asserting that R holds between x and y etc for R S 
any name of a relation holding between x and z if and only if there exists a y such that x R y and y S z and  
expresses here equality of extension between relations 

It should be noted that this rule of inference makes assertions about statements of a certain kind or form This 
fact distinguishes it clearly from a formula of a calculus in this case the calculus of relations such as 

For all R S and T and for all x y and z if x R y and y S z and RST then x T z 

This formula undoubtedly has some similarity to our rule of inference in fact it is that statement in the calculus of 
relations which corresponds to our 

 

 The best method I believe of formulating such schemata is one that uses Quines quasiquotation but I shall not 
introduce Quines notation here 

 

 

rule of inference But it is not the same it asserts something conditionally about all relations and 
individuals of a certain kind while the rule of inference asserts something unconditionally about 
all statements of a certain kindnamely that every statement of a certain form is deducible unconditionally 
from a set of statements of another form 

In a similar way we should distinguish for instance between the rule of inference called Barbara of traditional 
logic 

M a P 

S a M 

S a P 

and the formula of the calculus of classes If M a P and S a M then S a P or in slightly more modern writing If c 
 b and a cid
propositional logic or the modus ponendo ponens 

 b or between the rule of inferencewhich is called the principle of inference of 

 c then a cid

p 

If p then q 

q 

and the formula of the calculus of propositions If p and if p then q then q 

The fact that to every wellknown rule of inference there corresponds a logically true hypothetical or conditional 
formula of some wellknown calculusa logicians hypothetical as Professor Ryle calls these formulaehas led to 
confusion between rules of inference and the corresponding conditional formulae But there are important 
differences  Rules of inference are always statements about statements or about classes of statements 
they are metalinguistic but the formulae of the calculi are not  The rules of inference are unconditional 
statements about deducibility but the corresponding formulae of the calculi are conditional or hypothetical If    
then    statements which do not mention deducibility or inference or premises or conclusions  A rule of 
inference after substitution of constants for the variables asserts something about a certain argumentan 
observance of the rulenamely that this argument is valid but the corresponding formula after substitution yields a 
logical truism ie a statement such as All tables are tables although in hypothetical form as for example If it is 
a table then it is a table or If all men are mortal and all Greeks are men then all Greeks are mortal  The rules of 
inference are never used as premises in those arguments which are formulated in accordance with them but the 
corresponding formulae are used in this way In fact one of the main motives in constructing logical calculi is this by 
using the logicians hypotheticals ie those hypothetical truisms which correspond to a certain rule of inference as 
a premise we can dispense with the corresponding rule of inference By this method we can eliminate all the 
different rules of inferenceexcept one the abovementioned principle of inference or two if we make use of the 
principle of substitution which however can be avoided In other 

 

cid
cid
cid
cid
words the method of building up a logical calculus is a method of systematically reducing a vast number of rules of 
inference to one or two The place of all the others is taken by formulae of the calculus which has the advantage 
that all these formulaean infinite number in factcan be in turn systematically inferred using the principle of 
inference from a very few formulae 

We have indicated that for each of the wellknown rules of inference there exists an asserted or demonstrable 
formula in a wellknown logical calculus The converse is not true in general though it is true for hypothetical 
formulae For example to the formula p or nonp or to nonp and nonp and to many others which are not 
hypothetical there exists no corresponding rule of inference 

Thus rules of inference and formulae of logical calculi have to be carefully distinguished This need not however 
prevent us from interpreting a certain subset of these formulaethe logicians hypotheticalsas rules of inference 
In fact our assertion that to every such hypothetical formula there corresponds a rule of inference justifies such an 
interpretation 

II 

After these somewhat technical preliminaries we now turn to Professor Ryles treatment of the question Why are 
rules of inference applicable to reality This question forms an important part of our original problem for we have just 
seen that a certain subset of the formulae of the logical calculi viz those which Professor Ryle calls the logicians 
hypotheticals can be interpreted as rules of inference 

Professor Ryles central thesis if I understand him rightly is this The rules of logic or more precisely the rules of 
inference are rules of procedure This means that they apply to certain procedures rather than to things or facts 
They do not apply to reality if by reality we mean the things and facts described for example by scientists and 
historians They do not apply in the sense in which a description say of a man may apply toor fiteither the man 
described or some other man or in the sense in which a descriptive theory for example of nuclear resonance 
absorption may apply toor fitthe atoms of Uranium Logical rules rather apply to the procedure of drawing 
inferences comparable to the way in which the rules of the highway code apply to the procedure of riding a bicycle or 
driving a car Logical rules can be observed or contravened and to apply them does not mean to make them fit but 
means to observe them to act in accordance with them If the question Why are the rules of logic applicable to 
reality is mistakenly intended to mean Why do the rules of logic fit the things and the facts of our world then the 
answer would be that the question assumes that they can and do fit the facts whereas it is not possible to predicate 
of the rules of logic that they are fitting the facts of the world or not fitting the facts of the world This is not possible 
any more than it is possible to predicate such a thing of the highway code or of the rules of chess 

 

 

 

Thus it seems that our problem disappears Those who wonder why the rules of inference apply to the world vainly 
trying to imagine what an illogical world would be like are the victims of an ambiguity Rules of inference are 
procedural rules or rules of performance so that they cannot apply in the sense of fit but only in the sense of being 
observed Thus a world in which they do not apply would not be an illogical world but a world peopled by illogical 
men 

This analysis which is Professor Ryles seems to me true and important and it may well indicate the direction in 
which a solution of our problem can be found But I do not feel satisfied that in itself it offers a solution 

The position appears to me in this way Professor Ryles analysis shows that one way of interpreting the problem 
reduces it to nonsense or to a pseudoproblem Now I have for many years made it a personal rule of procedure not 
to be easily satisfied with the reduction of problems to pseudoproblems Whenever somebody succeeds in reducing 
a problem to a pseudoproblem I always ask myself whether one could not find another interpretation of the original 
probleman interpretation which shows if possible that apart from the pseudoproblem there is also a real problem 
behind the original problem I have found in many cases that this rule of procedure was fruitful and successful I fully 
admit that an analysis which attempts to reduce the original problem to a pseudoproblem may often be extremely 
valuable it may show that there was a danger of muddled thinking and it may often help us to find the real problem 
But it does not settle it All this is the case here too I believe 

III 

I accept Professor Ryles view that the rules of logic or of inference are rules of procedure and as he himself 
indicates that they may be considered as good or useful or helpful rules of procedure Now I suggest that the 
problem Why are the rules of logic applicable to reality might be interpreted to mean Why are the rules of logic 
good or useful or helpful rules of procedure 

That this interpretation is justifiable can hardly be denied The man who applies the rules of logic in the sense that he 
acts according to them or as Professor Ryle says observes them does so probably because he finds them useful in 
practice But this means ultimately that he finds them useful in dealing with real situations ie with reality If we ask 
Why are these rules useful we ask something very similar to the question Why are they applicable and the 
similarity is sufficient I believe for claiming that this may very well be what the original questioner had in mind On 
the other hand there is no doubt any longer that our question ceases to be a pseudoproblem 

IV 

I believe that our question can be answered comparatively easily The man who finds observance of the rules of logic 
useful is we have seen a man 

 

 

who draws inferences That is to say he obtains from certain statements or descriptions of facts called premises 
other statements or descriptions of facts called conclusions And he finds the procedure useful because he finds 
that whenever he observes the rules of logic whether consciously or intuitively the conclusion will be true provided 
the premises were true In other words he will be able to obtain reliable and possibly valuable indirect information 
provided his original information was reliable and valuable 

If this is correct then we must substitute for our question Why are the rules of logic good rules of procedure 
another question namely What is the explanation of the fact that the logical rules of inference always lead to true 
conclusions provided the premises are true 

V 

I believe this question too can be answered comparatively easily Having learned to speak and to use our language 
for the purpose of describing facts we soon become more or less conversant with the procedure called reasoning or 
arguing that is to say with the intuitive procedure of obtaining some kind of secondary information which was not 
explicitly stated in our original information Part of this intuitive procedure can be analysed in terms of rules of 
inference The formulation of these rules is the principal task of logic 

Accordingly we may lay it down that a logicians rule of inference is by definition a good or valid rule of inference if 
and only if its observance ensures that we obtain true conclusions provided our premises are true And if we 
succeed in finding an observance of a suggested rule which allows us to obtain a false conclusion from true 
premisesI call this a counter examplethen we are satisfied that this rule was invalid In other words we call a rule 
of inference valid if and only if no counter example to this rule exists and we may be able to establish that none 
exists Similarly we call an observance of a rule of inferencethat is to say an inferencevalid if and only if no 
counter example exists to the observed rule 

Thus a good or valid rule of inference is useful because no counter example can be found ie because we can rely 
on it as a rule of procedure that leads from true descriptions of facts to true descriptions of facts But since we can 
say of a true description that it fits the facts applying in the sense of fitting does enter into our analysis in some 
indirect way after all For we can say that rules of inference apply to facts in so far as every observance of them 
which starts with a fitting description of facts can be relied on to lead to a description which likewise fits the facts 

It is perhaps not without interest that the fundamental importance of the principle that a valid inference from true 
premises invariably leads to true conclusions has been discussed at some length by Aristotle  Anal Prior II  

VI 

In order to see whether this result is of any use I shall try to apply it to a criticism of the three main views of the nature 
of logic The views I have in mind are 

 

 

A 
B 
C 
D 

E 

A The rules of logic are laws of thought 
A They are natural laws of thoughtthey describe how we actually do think and we cannot think otherwise 
A They are normative lawsthey tell us how we ought to think 
B The rules of logic are the most general laws of naturethey are descriptive laws holding for any object 
whatsoever 
C The rules of logic are laws of certain descriptive languagesof the use of words and especially of 
sentences 

The reason why A has been so widely held is I believe the fact that there is something compelling and 
inescapable about logical rulesat least about the simple ones They are said to hold good because we are 
compelled to think in accordance with thembecause a state of affairs for which they do not hold good is 
inconceivable But an argument that proceeds from inconceivability is like other selfevidence arguments always 
suspect The fact that a rule or a proposition appears to be true convincing compelling selfevident or what not is 
obviously no sufficient reason why it should be true although the opposite may well be the caseits truth may be the 
reason why it appears to us to be true or convincing In other words if the laws of logic hold for all objects ie if B 
is correct then their compelling character would be clear and reasonable otherwise we may perhaps feel compelled 
to think in this way merely because we have a neurotic compulsion In this way our criticism of A leads to B 

But another criticism of A leads to A namely the observation that we do not always reason in accordance with 
the laws of logic but that we sometimes commit what is usually called a fallacy A asserts that we ought to avoid 
such breaches of the rules of logic But why Is it immoral Certainly not  Alice in Wonderland is not immoral Is it 
stupid Hardly Obviously we ought to avoid breaches of the rules of logic if and only if we are interested in 
formulating or deriving statements which are true that is to say which are true descriptions of facts This 
consideration again leads us to B 

But Ba position which has been held by men like Bertrand Russell Morris Cohen and Ferdinand Gonsethseems 
to me not altogether satisfactory First because the rules of inference as we have emphasized with Professor Ryle 
are rules of procedure rather than descriptive statements secondly because an important class of logically true 
formulae viz precisely those which Professor Ryle would call the logicians hypotheticals can be interpreted as or 
correspond to rules of inference and because these as we have shown following Professor Ryle do not apply to 
facts in the sense in which a fitting description does Thirdly because any theory which does not allow for the radical 
difference between the status of a physical truism such as All rocks are heavy and a logical truism such as All 
rocks are rocks or perhaps Either all rocks are heavy or some rocks are not heavy must be unsatisfactory We feel 
that such a logically true proposition is true not because it describes the behaviour of all possible facts but simply 
because it does not take the risk of being falsified by any fact it does not exclude any possible 

 

 

fact and it therefore does not assert anything whatsoever of any fact at all But we need not go here into the problem 
of the status of these logical truisms For whatever their status may be logic is not primarily the doctrine of logical 
truisms it is primarily the doctrine of valid inference 

The position C has been criticizedrightly I thinkas unsatisfactory so long as it was bound up with the view that by 
a language we can for the purpose of logic understand a mere symbolism ie a symbolism apart from any 
meaning whatever this may mean I do not think that this view can be upheld And our definition of a valid inference 
would most certainly not be applicable to such a mere symbolism since this definition makes use of the term truth 
for we could not say of a mere symbolism which is void of meaning that it contains true or false statements We 
should therefore have no inference in our sense and no rules of inference and as a consequence we should have 
no answer to our question why the rules of logic are valid or good or useful 

But if we mean by a language a symbolism that allows us to make true statements and in respect of which we can 
explain as was first done by Tarski what we mean when we say of a certain statement that it is true then I believe 
the objections which so far have been raised against C lose most of their force A valid rule of inference with regard 
to such a semantic language system would be a rule to which in the language in question no counter example can 
be found because no counter example exists 

It may be said in passing that these rules of inference need not necessarily have that formal character which we 
know from our logical studies their character will depend rather on the character of the semantic language system 
under investigation Examples of semantic language systems have been analysed by Tarski and Carnap Yet for 
languages similar to those usually considered by logicians the rules of inference will be of that formal character to 
which we are accustomed 

VII 

As indicated by my last remarks the rules of procedure which we are discussing ie the rules of inference are to a 
certain extent always relative to a language system But they all have this in common their observance leads 
from true premises to true conclusions Thus there cannot be alternative logics in the sense that their rules of 
inference lead from true premises to conclusions which are not true simply because we have defined the term rule of 
inference in such a way that this is impossible This does not exclude the possibility of considering the rules of 
inference as special cases of more general rules for example of rules which allow us to attach to certain 
quasiconclusions a certain probability provided that certain quasipremises are true Yet there can be alternative 
logics in the sense that they formulate alternative systems of rules of inference with respect to more or less widely 
different languageslanguages which differ in what we call their logical structure 

 

 

We may take for example the language of categorical propositions subjectpredicate statements for which the 
traditional system of categorical syllogisms formulates the rules of inference The logical structure of this language is 
characterized by the fact that it contains only a small number of logical signssigns for the copula and its negation 
for universality and particularity and perhaps for the complementation or negation of its socalled terms If we now 
consider the argument formulated in section i second paragraph then we see that all three premises as well as the 
conclusion can be formulated in the language of categorical propositions Nevertheless if so formulated it is 
impossible to formulate a valid rule of inference which exhibits the general form of this argument and accordingly it 
is no longer possible to defend the validity of this argument once it has been couched in the language of categorical 
propositions Once we have fused the words mother of Richard into one termthe predicate of our first premisewe 
cannot separate them again The logical structure of this language is too poor to exhibit the fact that this predicate 
contains in some way or other the subject of the second premise and part of the subject of the third premise Similar 
remarks hold for the other two premises and for the conclusion Accordingly if we try to formulate the rule of 
inference we get something like 

A is b 

C is d 

All e are f 

A is g 

Here A and C stand for  Rachel and  Richard b for mother of Richard d for father of Robert e for mothers 
of fathers f for paternal grandmothers and g for paternal grandmother of Robert This rule of course is invalid 
since we can produce in the language of categorical propositions as many counter examples as we like Thus a 
language even though it may be rich enough for describing all the facts we wish to describe may not permit the 
formulation of the rules of inference needed to cover all the cases in which we can safely pass from true premises to 
true conclusions 

VIII 

These last considerations may be used for extending our analysis to the problem of the applicability of the calculi of 
logic and arithmetic for we must not forget that so far following Professor Ryle we have discussed only the 
applicability of rules of inference 

I believe that the construction of socalled logical calculi can be said to be due mainly to the desire to build up 
languages with regard to which all those inferences which we intuitively know how to draw can be formalized that 
is to say shown to be drawn in accordance with a very few explicit and valid rules of inference These rules of 
inference as rules of procedure speak about the language or calculus we are investigating They are therefore not 
to be stated in the calculus under investigation but in the socalled 

 

 

metalanguage of this calculus ie in the language which we use when discussing this calculus Syllogistic logic for 
example can be said to have been an attempt to construct such a language and many of its adherents still believe 
that it was successful and that all inferences which are really valid are formalized in its figures and moods We have 
seen that this is not the case Other systems have been built up with similar aims for example Principia 
Mathematica and have succeeded in formalizing practically all valid rules of inference as observed not only in 
ordinary discourse but also in mathematical arguments One is tempted to describe the task of constructing a 
language or calculus such that we can formalize all valid rules of inference partly with the help of the logical 
formulae of the calculus itself and partly with the help of a few rules of inference pertaining to this calculus as the 
prima facie fundamental problem of logic Now there is good reason to believe that this problem is insoluble at 
least if we do not admit for the purpose of formalizing relatively simple intuitive inferences procedures of an entirely 
different character such as inferences drawn from an infinite class of premises The position appears to be this 
although it is possible for any given valid intuitive inference to construct some language permitting the formalization 
of this inference it is not possible to construct one language permitting the formalization of all valid intuitive 
inferences This interesting situation which was first discussed to my knowledge by Tarski with reference to 
investigations by Goedel bears on our problem in so far as it shows that the applicability of every calculus in the 
sense of its suitability as a language with regard to which every valid intuitive inference can be formulated breaks 
down at some stage or otherI shall now turn to our problem of applicability this time however confined to the logical 
calculi or more precisely to the asserted formulae of the logical calculi rather than to the rules of inference Why are 
these calculiwhich may contain arithmeticapplicable to realityI shall try to answer this question in the form of three 
statements 
a 

These calculi as a rule are semantical systems  that is to say languages designed with the intention of being 
used for the description of certain facts If it turns out that they serve this purpose then we need not be 
surprised 
They may be so designed that they do not serve the purpose this can be seen from the fact that certain 
calculifor example the arithmetic of natural numbers or that of real numbersare helpful in describing certain 
kinds of fact but not other kinds 
In so far as a calculus is applied to reality it loses the character of a logical calculus and becomes a 
descriptive theory which may be empirically refutable and in so far as it is treated as irrefutable ie as 
a system of logically true formulae rather than a descriptive scientific theory it is not applied to reality 

b 

c 

 

 I am using this term in a slightly wider sense than Carnap for I do not see why a calculus designed to have an L
true interpretation in a certain semantical system cannot itself be simply described or interpreted as a formalized 
semantical system 

 

 

A remark that bears on a will be found in section ix In the present section only b and c will be briefly discussed 

As to b we may note that the calculus of natural numbers is used in order to count billiard balls or pennies or 
crocodiles while the calculus of real numbers provides a framework for measurements of continuous magnitudes 
such as geometrical distances or velocities This is especially clear in Brouwers theory of the real numbers We 
should not say that we have for instance  or perhaps  crocodiles in our zoo In order to count crocodiles we 
make use of the calculus of natural numbers But in order to determine the latitude of our zoo or its distance from 
Greenwich we may have to make use of  The belief that any one of the calculi of arithmetic is applicable to any 
reality a belief that seems to underlie the problem which was set to our symposium is therefore hardly tenable 

As to c if we consider a proposition such as      then it may be appliedfor example to applesin different 
senses of which I shall discuss only two In the first of these senses the statement  apples   apples   apples is 
taken to be irrefutable and logically true But it does not describe any fact involving applesany more than the 
statement All apples are apples does Like this latter statement it is a logical truism and the only difference is that it 
is based not on the definition of the signs All and are but on certain definitions of the signs    and  
These definitions may be either explicit or implicit We might say in this case that the application is not real but only 
apparent that we do not here describe any reality but only assert that a certain way of describing reality is equivalent 
to another way 

More important is the application in the second sense In this sense      may be taken to mean that if 
somebody has put two apples in a certain basket and then again two and has not taken any apples out of the 
basket there will be four in it In this interpretation the statement      helps us to calculate ie to describe 
certain physical facts and the symbol  stands for a physical manipulationfor physically adding certain things to 
other things We see here that it is sometimes possible to interpret an pparently logical symbol descriptively   But 
in this interpretation the statement      becomes a physical theory rather than a logical one and as a 
consequence we cannot be sure whether it remains universally true As a matter of fact it does not It may hold for 
apples but it hardly holds for rabbits If you put    rabbits in a basket you may soon find  or  in it Nor is it 
applicable to such things as drops If you put    drops into a dry flask you will never get four out of it In other 
words if you wonder what a world would look like in which      is not applicable it is easy to satisfy your 
curiosity A couple of rabbits of different sexes or a few drops of water may serve as a model for such a world If you 
answer that these examples are not fair because something has happened to the rabbits and to the drops 

 

 This bears on some fundamental problems discussed by Tarski in his Logic Semantics 
Metamathematics ch  and by Carnap in his Introduction to Semantics 

 

 

and because the equation      only applies to objects to which nothing happens then my answer is that if you 
interpret it in this way then it does not hold for reality for in reality something happens all the time but only for an 
abstract world of distinct objects in which nothing happens To the extent it is clear to which our real world 
resembles such an abstract world for example to the extent to which our apples do not rot or rot only very slowly or 
to which our rabbits or crocodiles do not happen to breed to the extent in other words to which physical conditions 
resemble the pure logical or arithmetical operation of addition to the same extent of course does arithmetic remain 
applicable But this statement is trivial 

An analogous statement may be made about the addition of measurements That any two straight sticks which if 
placed side by side are each of the length a will if placed end to end be together of the length  a is by no means 
logically necessary We can easily imagine a world in which sticks do behave according to the rules of perspective i
e exactly as they appear to behave in the visual field and on photographic platesa world in which they shrink if 
moved away from a certain centre eg that of the lens In fact for the purpose of the addition of certain measurable 
quantitiesvelocitieswe do seem to live in such a world According to special relativity the ordinary calculus of 
addition of measurements is inapplicable to velocities ie it leads to false results it has to be replaced by a different 
one Of course it is possible to reject the claim that the ordinary calculus of addition of velocities is inapplicable and 
to resist on principle any demand that it should be changed Such a principle would be tantamount to saying that 
velocities must necessarily be added in the ordinary way or in other words to claiming implicitly that they are to be 
defined as obeying the ordinary laws of addition But in this case of course velocities can no longer be defined by 
empirical measurements for we cannot define the same concept in two different ways and our calculus no longer 
applies to empirical reality 

Professor Ryle has helped us to approach the problem from the angle of an analysis of the word applicable My last 
remarks may be taken as a complementary attempt to tackle the problem by analysing the word reality and also the 
problem of the distinction between the logical and the descriptive use of symbols For I believe that whenever we are 
doubtful whether or not our statements deal with the real world we can decide it by asking ourselves whether or not 
we are ready to accept an empirical refutation If we are determined on principle to defend our statements in the 
face of refutations such as are provided by rabbits or drops or velocities we are not speaking about reality Only if 
we are ready to accept refutations do we speak about reality In Professor Ryles language we should have to say 
Only if we know how to abide by a refutation do we know how to speak about reality If we wish to formulate this 
readiness or knowledge how then we have to do it again with the help of a rule of procedure It is clear that only a 
performance rule can help us here for speaking about reality is a performance  

 

 With these questions cp my LScD 

 

 

IX 

My last remarkson cindicate the direction in which perhaps an answer may be found to what I hold to be the 
most important aspect of our manysided problem Yet I do not wish to conclude this paper without making it quite 
clear that I believe that the problem can be taken further Why we could ask are we at all successful in speaking 
about reality Is it not true that reality must have a definite structure in order that we can speak about it Could we 
not conceive of a reality which would be like a thick fogand nothing else no solids no movement Or perhaps like a 
fog with certain changes in itrather indefinite changes of light for example Of course by my very attempt to 
describe this world I have shown that it can be described in our language but this is not to say that any such world 
could be so described 

I do not think that in this form the question is a very serious one but I also do not think that it should be too quickly 
dismissed In fact I believe that we are all most intimately acquainted with a world that cannot be properly described 
by our language which has developed mainly as an instrument for describing and dealing with our physical 
environmentmore precisely with physical bodies of medium size in moderately slow motion The indescribable 
world I have in mind is of course the world I have in my mindthe world which most psychologists except the 
behaviourists attempt to describe somewhat unsuccessfully with the help of what is nothing but a host of metaphors 
taken from the languages of physics of biology and of social life 

But whatever the world to be described may be like and whatever may be the languages we use and their logical 
structure there is one thing we can be sure of as long as our interest in describing the world does not change we 
shall be interested in true descriptions and in inferencesthat is to say in operations which lead from true 
premises to true conclusions On the other hand there is certainly no reason to believe that our ordinary languages 
are the best means for the description of any world On the contrary they are probably not even the best possible 
means for a finer description of our own physical world The development of mathematics which is a somewhat 
artificial development of certain parts of our ordinary languages shows that with new linguistic means new kinds of 
facts can be described In a language possessing say five numerals and the word many even the simple fact that 
in field A there are  more sheep than in field B cannot be stated The use of an arithmetical calculus permits us to 
describe relations which simply could not be described without it 

There are however further and possibly deeper problems concerning the relations between the means of description 
and the described facts These relations are rarely seen in the right way The same philosophers who oppose a nave 
realism with regard to things are often nave realists with regard to facts While perhaps believing that things are 
logical constructs which I am satisfied is a mistaken view they believe that facts are part of the world in a 

 

 

sense similar to that in which processes or things may be said to be parts of the world that the world consists of facts 
in a sense in which it may be said to consist of four dimensional processes or of three dimensional things They 
believe that just as certain nouns are names of things sentences are names of facts And they sometimes even 
believe that sentences are something like pictures of facts or that they are projections of facts  But all this is 
mistaken The fact that there is no elephant in this room is not one of the processes or parts of the world nor is the 
fact that a hailstorm in Newfoundland occurred exactly  years after a tree collapsed in the New Zealand bush 
Facts are something like a common product of language and reality they are reality pinned down by descriptive 
statements They are like abstracts from a book made in a language which is different from that of the original and 
determined not only by the original book but nearly as much by the principles of selection and by other methods of 
abstracting and by the means of which the new language disposes New linguistic means not only help us to 
describe new kinds of facts in a way they even create new kinds of facts In a certain sense these facts obviously 
existed before the new means were created which were indispensable for their description I say obviously because 
a calculation for example of the movements of the planet Mercury of  years ago carried out today with the help 
of the calculus of the theory of relativity may certainly be a true description of the facts concerned even though the 
theory was not yet invented when these facts occurred But in another sense we might say that these facts do not 
exist as facts before they are singled out from the continuum of events and pinned down by statementsthe 
theories which describe them These questions however although closely connected with our problem must be left 
for another discussion I have mentioned them only in order to make clear that even should the solutions I have 
proposed be more or less correct there would still be open problems left in this field

TRUTH RATIONALITY AND THE GROWTH OF SCIENTIFIC 
KNOWLEDGE 
 THE GROWTH OF KNOWLEDGE THEORIES AND 
PROBLEMS 
I 

MY aim in this lecture is to stress the significance of one particular aspect of scienceits need to grow or if you like 
its need to progress I do not have in mind here the practical or social significance of this need What I wish to discuss 
is rather its intellectual significance I assert that continued growth is essential to the rational and empirical character 
of scientific knowledge that if science ceases to grow it must lose that character It is the way of its growth which 
makes science rational and empirical the way that is in which scientists discriminate between available theories and 
choose the better one or in the absence of a satisfactory theory the way they give reasons for rejecting all the 
available theories thereby suggesting some of the conditions with which a satisfactory theory should comply 

You will have noticed from this formulation that it is not the accumulation of observations which I have in mind when I 
speak of the growth of scientific knowledge but the repeated overthrow of scientific theories and their replacement by 
better or more satisfactory ones This incidentally is a procedure which might be found worthy of attention even by 

those who see the most important aspect of the growth of scientific knowledge in new experiments and in new 
observations For our critical examination of our theories leads us to attempts to test and to overthrow them and 
these lead us further to experiments and observations of a kind which nobody would ever have dreamt of without the 
stimulus and guidance both of our theories and of our 

 

 

criticism of them For indeed the most interesting experiments and observations were carefully designed by us in 
order to test our theories especially our new theories 

In this paper then I wish to stress the significance of this aspect of science and to solve some of the problems old 
as well as new which are connected with the notions of scientific progress and of discrimination among competing 
theories The new problems I wish to discuss are mainly those connected with the notions of objective truth and of 
getting nearer to the truthnotions which seem to me of great help in analysing the growth of knowledge 

Although I shall confine my discussion to the growth of knowledge in science my remarks are applicable without 
much change I believe to the growth of prescientific knowledge alsothat is to say to the general way in which 
men and even animals acquire new factual knowledge about the world The method of learning by trial and errorof 
learning from our mistakesseems to be fundamentally the same whether it is practised by lower or by higher 
animals by chimpanzees or by men of science My interest is not merely in the theory of scientific knowledge but 
rather in the theory of knowledge in general Yet the study of the growth of scientific knowledge is I believe the most 
fruitful way of studying the growth of knowledge in general For the growth of scientific knowledge may be said to be 
the growth of ordinary human knowledge writ large as I have pointed out in the  Preface to my Logic of 
Scientific Discovery 

But is there any danger that our need to progress will go unsatisfied and that the growth of scientific knowledge will 
come to an end In particular is there any danger that the advance of science will come to an end because science 
has completed its task I hardly think so thanks to the infinity of our ignorance Among the real dangers to the 
progress of science is not the likelihood of its being completed but such things as lack of imagination sometimes a 
consequence of lack of real interest or a misplaced faith in formalization and precision which will be discussed 
below in section v or authoritarianism in one or another of its many forms 

Since I have used the word progress several times I had better make quite sure at this point that I am not mistaken 
for a believer in a historical law of progress Indeed I have before now struck various blows against the belief in a law 
of progress  and I hold that even science is not subject to the operation of anything resembling such a law The 
history of science like the history of all human ideas is a history of irresponsible dreams of obstinacy and of error 
But science is one of the very few human activitiesperhaps the only onein which errors are systematically criticized 
and fairly often in time corrected This is why we can say that in science we often learn from our mistakes and why 
we can speak clearly and sensibly about making progress there In most other fields of human endeavour there is 
change but rarely 

 

 See especially my Poverty of Historicism  nd edn  and ch  of the present volume 

 

 

progress unless we adopt a very narrow view of our possible aims in life for almost every gain is balanced or more 
than balanced by some loss And in most fields we do not even know how to evaluate change 

Within the field of science we have however a criterion of progress even before a theory has ever undergone 
an empirical test we may be able to say whether provided it passes certain specified tests it would be an 
improvement on other theories with which we are acquainted This is my first thesis 

To put it a little differently I assert that we know what a good scientific theory should be like andeven before it has 
been testedwhat kind of theory would be better still provided it passes certain crucial tests And it is this meta
scientific knowledge which makes it possible to speak of progress in science and of a rational choice between 
theories 

II 

Thus it is my first thesis that we can know of a theory even before it has been tested that if it passes certain tests it 
will be better than some other theory 

My first thesis implies that we have a criterion of relative potential satisfactoriness or of potential 
progressiveness which can be applied to a theory even before we know whether or not it will turn out by the passing 
of some crucial tests to be satisfactory in fact 

This criterion of relative potential satisfactoriness which I formulated some time ago  and which incidentally allows 
us to grade theories according to their degree of relative potential satisfactoriness is extremely simple and intuitive It 
characterizes as preferable the theory which tells us more that is to say the theory which contains the greater 
amount of empirical information or content which is logically stronger which has the greater explanatory and 
predictive power and which can therefore be more severely tested by comparing predicted facts with 
observations In short we prefer an interesting daring and highly informative theory to a trivial one 

All these properties which it thus appears we desire in a theory can be shown to amount to one and the same thing 
to a higher degree of empirical content or of testability 

III 

My study of the content of a theory or of any statement whatsoever was based on the simple and obvious idea 
that the informative content of the conjunction ab of any two statements a and b will always be greater than or 
at least equal to that of any of its components 

Let a be the statement It will rain on Friday b the statement It will be 

 

 See the discussion of degrees of testability empirical content corroborability and corroboration in my LScD 
especially sections  to   to  new appendix ix also the discussion of degrees of explanatory power in 
this appendix and especially the comparison of Einsteins and Newtons theories in note  on p  In what 
follows I shall sometimes refer to testability etc as the criterion of progress without going into the more 
detailed distinctions discussed in my book 

 

 

fine on Saturday and ab the statement It will rain on Friday and it will be fine on Saturday it is then obvious that the 
informative content of this last statement the conjunction ab will exceed that of its component a and also that of its 
component b And it will also be obvious that the probability of ab or what is the same the probability that ab will be 
true will be smaller than that of either of its components 

Writing Cta for the content of the statement a and Ctab for the content of the conjunction a and b we have 

 Cta Ctab Ctb 

This contrasts with the corresponding law of the calculus of probability 

 pa pab pb 

where the inequality signs of are inverted Together these two laws  and  state that with increasing content 
probability decreases and vice versa or in other words that content increases with increasing improbability This 
analysis is of course in full agreement with the general idea of the logical content of a statement as the class of all 
those statements which are logically entailed by it We may also say that a statement a is logically stronger 
than a statement b if its content is greater than that of bthat is to say if it entails more than b 

This trivial fact has the following inescapable consequences if growth or knowledge means that we operate with 
theories of increasing content it must also mean that we operate with theories of decreasing probability in the sense 
of the calculus of probability Thus if our aim is the advancement or growth of knowledge then a high probability in 
the sense of the calculus of probability cannot possibly be our aim as well these two aims are incompatible 

I found this trivial though fundamental result about thirty years ago and I have been preaching it ever since Yet the 
prejudice that a high probability must be something highly desirable is so deeply ingrained that my trivial result is still 
held by many to be paradoxical  Despite this simple result the idea that a high degree of probability in the sense of 
the calculus of probability must be something highly desirable seems to be so obvious to most people that they are 
not prepared to consider it critically Dr Bruce BrookeWavell has therefore suggested to me that I should stop talking 
in this context of probability and should base my arguments on a calculus of content and of relative content or in 
other words that I should not speak about science aiming at improbability but merely say that it aims at maximum 
content I have given much thought to this suggestion but I do not think that it would help a headon collision with the 
widely accepted and 

 

 See for example J C Harsany Poppers Improbability Criterion for the Choice of Scientific Hypotheses 
Philosophy   pp  f Incidentally I do not propose any criterion for the choice of scientific 
hypotheses every choice remains a risky guess Moreover the theoreticians choice is the hypothesis most 
worthy of further critical discussion rather than of acceptance 

 

 

deeply ingrained probabilistic prejudice seems unavoidable if the matter is really to be cleared up Even if as would 
be easy enough I were to base my own theory upon the calculus of content or of logical strength it would still be 
necessary to explain that the probability calculus in its logical application to propositions or statements is nothing 
but a calculus of the logical weakness or lack of content of these statements either of absolute logical 
weakness or of relative logical weakness Perhaps a headon collision would be avoidable if people were not so 
generally inclined to assume uncritically that a high probability must be an aim of science and that therefore the 
theory of induction must explain to us how we can attain a high degree of probability for our theories And it then 
becomes necessary to point out that there is something elsea truthlikeness or verisimilitudewith a calculus totally 
different from the calculus of probability with which it seems to have been confused 

To avoid these simple results all kinds of more or less sophisticated theories have been designed I believe I have 
shown that none of them is successful But what is more important they are quite unnecessary One merely has to 
recognize that the property which we cherish in theories and which we may perhaps call verisimilitude or 
truthlikeness see section xi below is not a probability in the sense of the calculus of probability of which 
 is an inescapable theorem 

It should be noted that the problem before us is not a problem of words I do not mind what you call probability and I 
do not mind if you call those degrees for which the socalled calculus of probability holds by any other name I 
personally think that it is most convenient to reserve the term probability for whatever may satisfy the wellknown 
rules of this calculus which Laplace Keynes Jeffreys and many others have formulated and for which I have given 
various formal axiom systems If and only if we accept this terminology then there can be no doubt that the 
absolute probability of a statement a is simply the degree of its logical weakness or lack of informative 
content and that the relative probability of a statement a given a statement b is simply the degree of the relative 
weakness or the relative lack of new informative content in statement a assuming that we are already in 
possession of the information b 

Thus if we aim in science at a high informative contentif the growth of knowledge means that we know more that 
we know a and b rather than a alone and that the content of our theories thus increasesthen we have to admit that 
we also aim at a low probability in the sense of the calculus of probability 

And since a low probability means a high probability of being falsified it follows that a high degree of falsifiability or 
refutability or testability is one of the aims of sciencein fact precisely the same aim as a high informative content 

The criterion of potential satisfactoriness is thus testability or improbability only a highly testable or improbable 
theory is worth testing and is 

 

actually and not merely potentially satisfactory if it withstands severe tests especially those tests to which we could 
point as crucial for the theory before they were ever undertaken 

It is possible in many cases to compare the severity of tests objectively It is even possible if we find it worth while to 
define a measure of the severity of tests See the Addenda to this volume By the same method we can define the 
explanatory power and the degree of corroboration of a theory  

IV 

The thesis that the criterion here proposed actually dominates the progress of science can easily be illustrated with 
the help of historical examples The theories of Kepler and Galileo were unified and superseded by Newtons logically 
stronger and better testable theory and similarly Fresnels and Faradays by Maxwells Newtons theory and 
Maxwells in their turn were unified and superseded by Einsteins In each such case the progress was towards a 
more informative and therefore logically less probable theory towards a theory which was more severely testable 
because it made predictions which in a purely logical sense were more easily refutable 

A theory which is not in fact refuted by testing those new and bold and improbable predictions to which it gives rise 
can be said to be corroborated by these severe tests I may remind you in this connection of Galles discovery of 
Neptune of Hertzs discovery of electromagnetic waves of Eddingtons eclipse observations of Elsassers 
interpretation of Davissons maxima as interference fringes of de Broglie waves and of Powells observations of the 
first Yukawa mesons 

All these discoveries represent corroborations of severe testsof predictions which were highly improbable in the light 
of our previous knowledge previous to the theory which was tested and corroborated Other important discoveries 
have also been made while testing a theory though they did not lead to its corroboration but to its refutation A recent 
and important case is the refutation of parity But Lavoisiers classical experiments which show that the volume of air 
decreases while a candle burns in a closed space or that the weight of burning ironfilings increases do not establish 
the oxygen theory of combustion yet they tend to refute the phlogiston theory 

Lavoisiers experiments were carefully thought out but even most socalled chancediscoveries are fundamentally of 
the same logical structure For these socalled chancediscoveries are as a rule refutations of theories which were 
consciously or unconsciously held they are made when some of our expectations based upon these theories are 
unexpectedly disappointed Thus the catalytic property of mercury was discovered when it was accidentally found 
that in its presence a chemical reaction had been speeded up which had not been expected to be influenced by 
mercury But neither Oersteds nor Rntgens nor Becquerels nor Flemings discoveries were really accidental 

 

 See especially appendix ix to my LScD 

 

 

 

even though they had accidental components every one of these men was searching for an effect of the kind he 
found 

We can even say that some discoveries such as Columbus discovery of America corroborate one theory of the 
spherical earth while refuting at the same time another the theory of the size of the earth and with it of the nearest 
way to India and that they were chancediscoveries to the extent to which they contradicted all expectations and 
were not consciously undertaken as tests of those theories which they refuted 

V 

The stress I am laying upon change in scientific knowledge upon its growth or its progressiveness may to some 
extent be contrasted with the current ideal of science as an axiomatized deductive system This ideal has been 
dominant in European epistemology from Euclids Platonizing cosmology for this is I believe what Euclid 
Elements were really intended to be to that of Newton and further to the systems of Boscovic Maxwell Einstein 
Bohr Schrdinger and Dirac It is an epistemology that sees the final task and end of scientific activity in the 
construction of an axiomatized deductive system 

As opposed to this I now believe that these most admirable deductive systems should be regarded as stepping 
stones rather than as ends  as important stages on our way to richer and better testable scientific knowledge 

Regarded thus as means or stepping stones they are certainly quite indispensable for we are bound to develop our 
theories in the form of deductive systems This is made unavoidable by the logical strength by the great informative 
content which we have to demand of our theories if they are to be better and better testable The wealth of their 
consequences has to be unfolded deductively for as a rule a theory cannot be tested except by testing one by one 
some of its more remote consequences consequences that is which cannot immediately be seen upon inspecting it 
intuitively 

Yet it is not the marvellous deductive unfolding of the system which makes a theory rational or empirical but the fact 
that we can examine it critically that is to say subject it to attempted refutations including observational tests and 
the fact that in certain cases a theory may be able to withstand those criticisms and those testsamong them tests 
under which its predecessors broke down and sometimes even further and more severe tests It is in the rational 
choice of the new theory that the rationality of science lies rather than in the deductive development of the theory 

Consequently there is little merit in formalizing and elaborating a deductive nonconventional system beyond the 
requirements of the task of criticizing and testing it and of comparing it critically with competitors This critical 

 

 I have been influenced in adopting this view by Dr J Agassi who in a discussion in  convinced me that the 
attitude of looking upon the finished deductive systems as an end is a relic of the long domination of Newtonian 
ideas and thus I may add of the Platonic and Euclidean tradition For an even more radical view of Dr Agassis 
see the last footnote to this chapter 

 

 

comparison though it has admittedly some minor conventional and arbitrary aspects is largely nonconventional 
thanks to the criterion of progress It is this critical procedure which contains both the rational and the empirical 
elements of science It contains those choices those rejections and those decisions which show that we have learnt 
from our mistakes and thereby added to our scientific knowledge 

VI 

Yet perhaps even this picture of scienceas a procedure whose rationality consists in the fact that we learn from our 
mistakesis not quite good enough It may still suggest that science progresses from theory to theory and that it 
consists of a sequence of better and better deductive systems Yet what I really wish to suggest is that science 
should be visualized as progressing from problems to problemsto problems of ever increasing depth 

For a scientific theoryan explanatory theoryis if anything an attempt to solve a scientific problem that is to say a 
problem concerned or connected with the discovery of an explanation  

Admittedly our expectations and thus our theories may precede historically even our problems Yet science 
starts only with problems Problems crop up especially when we are disappointed in our expectations or when 
our theories involve us in difficulties in contradictions and these may arise either within a theory or between two 
different theories or as the result of a clash between our theories and our observations Moreover it is only through a 
problem that we become conscious of holding a theory It is the problem which challenges us to learn to advance our 
knowledge to experiment and to observe 

Thus science starts from problems and not from observations though observations may give rise to a problem 
especially if they are unexpected that is to say if they clash with our expectations or theories The conscious task 
before the scientist is always the solution of a problem through the construction of a theory which solves the problem 
for example by explaining unexpected and unexplained observations Yet every worthwhile new theory raises new 
problems problems of reconciliation problems of how to conduct new and previously unthoughtof observational 
tests And it is mainly through the new problems which it raises that it is fruitful 

Thus we may say that the most lasting contribution to the growth of scientific knowledge that a theory can make are 
the new problems which it raises so that we are led back to the view of science and of the growth of knowledge as 
always starting from and always ending with problemsproblems of an ever increasing depth and an ever increasing 
fertility in suggesting new problems

 THE THEORY OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH 
CORRESPONDENCE TO THE FACTS 
VII 

So far I have spoken about science its progress and its criterion of progress without even mentioning truth 
Perhaps surprisingly this can be done without falling into pragmatism or instrumentalism Indeed it is even possible 
to argue in favour of the intuitive satisfactoriness of the criterion of progress in science without ever speaking about 
the truth of its theories In fact before I became acquainted with Tarskis theory of truth  it appeared to me safer and 
more economical to discuss the criterion of progress without getting too deeply involved in the highly controversial 
problem connected with the use of the word true 

My attitude at the time was this although I accepted as almost everybody does the objective or absolute or 
correspondence theory of truthtruth as correspondence with the factsI preferred to avoid the topic For it appeared 
to me hopeless to try to understand clearly this strangely elusive idea of a correspondence between a statement and 
a fact 

In order to recall why the situation appeared so hopeless we only have to remember as one example among many 
Wittgenstein Tractatus with its surprisingly nave picture theory or projection theory of truth In this book a 
proposition was conceived as a picture or projection of the fact which it was intended to describe and as having the 
same structure or form as that fact just as a gramophone record is indeed a picture or a projection of a sound and 
shares some of its structural properties  

Another of these unavailing attempts to explain this correspondence was due to Schlick who gave a beautifully clear 
and truly devastating criticism  of various correspondence theoriesincluding the picture or projection theorybut 
who unfortunately produced in his turn another one which was no better He interpreted the correspondence in 
question as a oneone correspondence between our designations and the designated objects although counter 
examples abound designations applying to many objects objects designated by many designations which show that 
this interpretation is untenable 

All this was changed by Tarskis theory of truth and of the correspondence of a statement with the facts Tarskis 
greatest achievement and the real significance of his theory for the philosophy of the empirical sciences lies I 
believe in the fact that he reestablished a correspondence theory of absolute or objective truth which showed that 
we are free to use the intuitive idea of truth as correspondence with the facts The view that his theory is applicable 
only to formalized languages is I think mistaken It is applicable to any consistent andmore or lessnatural 
language So we must try to learn

from Tarskis analysis how to dodge its inconsistencies which means admittedly the introduction of a certain amount 
of artificialityor caution into its useAlthough I may assume in this assembly some familiarity with Tarskis theory 
of truth I may perhaps explain the way in which it can be regarded from an intuitive point of view as a simple 
elucidation of the idea of correspondence with the facts I shall have to stress this almost trivial point because 
in spite of its triviality it will be crucial for my argumentThe highly intuitive character of Tarskis ideas seems to 
become more evident as I have found in teaching if we first decide explicitly to take truth as a synonym for 
correspondence with the facts and then forgetting all about truth proceed to define the idea of 
correspondence with the factsThus we shall first consider the following two formulations each of which states 
very simply in a metalanguage under what conditions a certain assertion in an object language corresponds to the 
facts 
 

 The statement or the assertion Snow is white corresponds to the facts if and only if snow is indeed 
white 
 The statement or the assertion Grass is red corresponds to the facts if and only if grass is indeed 
red 

 

These formulations in which the word indeed is only inserted for ease and may be omitted sound of course quite 
trivial But it was left to Tarski to discover that in spite of their apparent triviality they contained the solution of the 
problem of explaining correspondence with the facts and with it truth 

I have said that Schlicks theory was mistaken yet I think that certain comments he made loc cit about his own 
theory throw some light on Tarskis For Schlick says that the problem of truth shared the fate of some others whose 
solutions were not easily seen because they were mistakenly supposed to lie on a very deep level while actually they 
were fairly plain and at first sight unimpressive Tarskis solution may well appear unimpressive at first sight Yet its 
fertility and its power are impressive indeed This however is not my topic here 

VIII 

Thanks to Tarskis work the idea of objective or absolute truththat is truth as correspondence with the facts
appears to be accepted today with confidence by all who understand it The difficulties in understanding it seem to 
have two sources first the combination of an extremely simple intuitive idea with a certain amount of complexity in 
the execution of the technical programme to which it gives rise secondly the widespread but mistaken dogma that a 
satisfactory theory of truth would have to be a theory of true beliefof wellfounded or rational belief Indeed the 
three rivals of the correspondence theory of truththe coherence theory which mistakes consistency for truth the 
evidence theory which mistakes known to be true for true and the pragmatic or instrumentalist theory which 
mistakes usefulness 

 

 

for truththese are all subjective or epistemic theories of truth in contradistinction to Tarskis objective or 
metalogical theory They are subjective in the sense that they all stem from the fundamental subjectivist 
position which can conceive of knowledge only as a special kind of mental state or as a 
disposition or as a special kind of belief characterized for example by its history or by its relation to other 
beliefs 

If we start from our subjective experience of believing and thus look upon knowledge as a special kind of belief then 
we may indeed have to look upon truththat is true knowledgeas some even more special kind of belief as one 
that is wellfounded or justified This would mean that there should be some more or less effective criterion if only a 
partial one of wellfoundedness some symptom by which to differentiate the experience of a wellfounded belief from 
other experiences of belief It can be shown that all subjective theories of truth aim at such a criterion they try to 
define truth in terms of the sources or origins of our beliefs  or in terms of our operations of verification or of some 
set of rules of acceptance or simply in terms of the quality of our subjective convictions They all say more or less 
that truth is what we are justified in believing or in accepting in accordance with certain rules or criteria of origins or 
sources of our knowledge or of reliability or stability or biological success or strength of conviction or inability to 
think otherwise 

The objective theory of truth leads to a very different attitude This may be seen from the fact that it allows us to make 
assertions such as the following a theory may be true even though nobody believes it and even though we have no 
reason for accepting it or for believing that it is true and another theory may be false although we have 
comparatively good reasons for accepting it 

Clearly these assertions would appear to be selfcontradictory from the point of view of any subjective or epistemic 
theory of truth But within the objective theory they are not only consistent but quite obviously true 

A similar assertion which the objective correspondence theory would make quite natural is this even if we hit upon a 
true theory we shall as a rule be merely guessing and it may well be impossible for us to know that it is true 

An assertion like this was made apparently for the first time by Xenophanes  who lived  years ago which 
shows that the objective theory of truth is very old indeedantedating Aristotle who also held it But only with Tarskis 
work has the suspicion been removed that the objective theory of truth as correspondence with the facts may be 
either selfcontradictory because of the paradox of the liar or empty as Ramsey suggested or barren or at the 
very least redundant in the sense that we can do without it as I once thought myself 

In my theory of scientific progress I might perhaps do without it up to a point Since Tarski however I no longer see 
any reason why I should try to 

 
 See my Introduction to this volume On the Sources of Knowledge and of Ignorance 
 See the Introduction p  and ch  p  f above 

 

 

avoid it And if we wish to elucidate the difference between pure and applied science between the search for 
knowledge and the search for power or for powerful instruments then we cannot do without it For the difference is 
that in the search for knowledge we are out to find true theories or at least theories which are nearer than others to 
the truthwhich correspond better to the facts whereas in the search for theories that are merely powerful 
instruments for certain purposes we are in many cases quite well served by theories which are known to be false 
 

So one great advantage of the theory of objective or absolute truth is that it allows us to saywith Xenophanesthat 
we search for truth but may not know when we have found it that we have no criterion of truth but are nevertheless 
guided by the idea of truth as a regulative principle as Kant or Peirce might have said and that though there 
are no general criteria by which we can recognize truthexcept perhaps tautological truththere are something like 
criteria of progress towards the truth as I shall explain presently 

The status of truth in the objective sense as correspondence to the facts and its role as a regulative principle may 
be compared to that of a mountain peak which is permanently or almost permanently wrapped in clouds The 
climber may not merely have difficulties in getting therehe may not know when he gets there because he may be 
unable to distinguish in the clouds between the main summit and some subsidiary peak Yet this does not affect the 
objective existence of the summit and if the climber tells us I have some doubts whether I reached the actual 
summit then he does by implication recognize the objective existence of the summit The very idea of error or of 
doubt in its normal straightforward sense implies the idea of an objective truth which we may fail to reach 

Though it may be impossible for the climber ever to make sure that he has reached the summit it will often be easy 
for him to realize that he has not reached it or not yet reached it for example when he is turned back by an 
overhanging wall Similarly there will be cases when we are quite sure that we have not reached the truth Thus 
while coherence or consistency is no criterion of truth simply because even demonstrably consistent systems may 
be false in fact incoherence or inconsistency do establish falsity so if we are lucky we may discover inconsistencies 
and use them to establish the falsity of some of our theories  

In  when Tarski published the first English outline of his investigations into the theory of truth which he had 
published in Poland in  few philosophers would have dared to make assertions like those of Xenophanes and 
it is interesting that the volume in which Tarskis paper was published also contained two subjectivist papers on truth 
 

 
 See the discussion of the second view called instrumentalism in ch  above 
 See Alfred Tarski paper The Semantic Conception of Truth in Philosophy and Phenom Research

 See the volume referred to in the preceding note especially pp  and  

 

 

Though things have improved since then subjectivism is still rampant in the philosophy of science and especially in 
the field of probability theory The subjectivist theory of probability which interprets degrees of probability as degrees 
of rational belief stems directly from the subjectivist approach to truthespecially from the coherence theory Yet it is 
still embraced by philosophers who have accepted Tarskis theory of truth At least some of them I suspect have 
turned to probability theory in the hope that it would give them what they had originally expected from a subjectivist or 
epistemological theory of the attainment of truth through verification that is a theory of rational and justifiable 
belief based upon observed instances  

It is an awkward point in all these subjective theories that they are irrefutable in the sense that they can too easily 
evade any criticism For it is always possible to uphold the view that everything we say about the world or everything 
we print about logarithms should be replaced by a beliefstatement Thus we may replace the statement Snow is 
white by I believe that snow is white or perhaps even by In the light of all the available evidence I believe that it is 
rational to believe that snow is white The possibility of replacing any assertion about the objective world by one of 
these subjectivist circumlocutions is trivial though in the case of the assertions expressed in logarithm tableswhich 
might well be produced by machinessomewhat unconvincing It may be mentioned in passing that the subjective 
interpretation of logical probability links these subjectivist replacements exactly as in the case of the coherence 
theory of truth with an approach which on closer analysis turns out to be essentially syntactic rather than semantic
although it can of course always be presented within the framework of a semantical system 

It may be useful to sum up the relationships between the objective and subjective theories of scientific knowledge 
with the help of a little table

Like many other philosophers I am at times inclined to classify philosophers as belonging to two main groupsthose 
with whom I disagree and those who agree with me I also call them the verificationists or the justificationist 
philosophers of knowledge or of belief and the falsificationists or fallibilists or critical philosophers of knowledge or 
of conjectures I may mention in passing a third group with whom I also disagree They may be called the 
disappointed justificationiststhe irrationalists and sceptics 

The members of the first groupthe verificationists or justificationistshold roughly speaking that whatever cannot be 
supported by positive reasons is unworthy of being believed or even of being taken into serious consideration 

On the other hand the members of the second groupthe falsificationists or fallibilistssay roughly speaking that 
what cannot at present in principle be overthrown by criticism is at present unworthy of being seriously considered 
while what can in principle be so overthrown and yet resists all our critical efforts to do so may quite possibly be false 
but is at any rate not unworthy of being seriously considered and perhaps even of being believedthough only 
tentatively 

Verificationists I admit are eager to uphold that most important tradition of rationalismthe fight of reason against 
superstition and arbitrary authority For they demand that we should accept a belief only if it can be justified by 
positive evidence that is to say shown to be true or at least to be highly probable In other words they 
demand that we should accept a belief only if it can be verified or probabilistically confirmed 

Falsificationists the group of fallibilists to which I belong believeas most irrationalists also believethat they have 
discovered logical arguments which show that the programme of the first group cannot be carried out that we can 
never give positive reasons which justify the belief that a theory is true But unlike irrationalists we falsificationists 
believe that we have also discovered a way to realize the old ideal of distinguishing rational science from various 
forms of superstition in spite of the breakdown of the original inductivist or justificationist programme We hold that 
this ideal can be realized very simply by recognizing that the rationality of science lies not in 

 

 

its habit of appealing to empirical evidence in support of its dogmasastrologers do so toobut solely in the critical 
approachin an attitude which of course involves the critical use among other arguments of empirical evidence 
especially in refutations For us therefore science has nothing to do with the quest for certainty or probability or 
reliability We are not interested in establishing scientific theories as secure or certain or probable Conscious of our 
fallibility we are only interested in criticizing them and testing them in the hope of finding out where we are mistaken 
of learning from our mistakes and if we are lucky of proceeding to better theories 

Considering their views about the positive or negative function of argument in science the first groupthe 
justificationistsmay be also nicknamed the positivists and the secondthe group to which I belongthe critics or the 
negativists These are of course mere nicknames Yet they may perhaps suggest some of the reasons why some 
people believe that only the positivists or verificationists are seriously interested in truth and in the search for truth 
while we the critics or negativists are flippant about the search for truth and addicted to barren and destructive 
criticism and to the propounding of views which are clearly paradoxical 

This mistaken picture of our views seems to result largely from the adoption of a justificationist programme and of the 
mistaken subjectivist approach to truth which I have described 

For the fact is that we too see science as the search for truth and that at least since Tarski we are no longer afraid 
to say so Indeed it is only with respect to this aim the discovery of truth that we can say that though we are fallible 
we hope to learn from our mistakes It is only the idea of truth which allows us to speak sensibly of mistakes and of 
rational criticism and which makes rational discussion possiblethat is to say critical discussion in search of 
mistakes with the serious purpose of eliminating as many of these mistakes as we can in order to get nearer to the 
truth Thus the very idea of errorand of fallibilityinvolves the idea of an objective truth as the standard of which we 
may fall short It is in this sense that the idea of truth is a regulative idea 

Thus we accept the idea that the task of science is the search for truth that is for true theories even though as 
Xenophanes pointed out we may never get them or know them as true if we get them Yet we also stress that 
truth is not the only aim of science We want more than mere truth what we look for is interesting truth
truth which is hard to come by And in the natural sciences as distinct from mathematics what we look for is truth 
which has a high degree of explanatory power which implies that it is logically improbable 

For it is clear first of all that we do not merely want truthwe want more truth and new truth We are not content with 
twice two equals four even though it is true we do not resort to reciting the multiplication table if we are faced with a 
difficult problem in topology or in physics Mere truth is not 

 

 

enough what we look for are answers to our problems The point has been well put by the German humorist 
and poet Busch of MaxandMoritz fame in a little nursery rhymeI mean a rhyme for the epistemological nursery  

Twice two equals four tis true 
But too empty and too trite 
What I look for is a clue 
To some matters not so light 

Only if it is an answer to a problema difficult a fertile problem a problem of some depthdoes a truth or a 
conjecture about the truth become relevant to science This is so in pure mathematics and it is so in the natural 
sciences And in the latter we have something like a logical measure of the depth or significance of the problem in 
the increase of logical improbability or explanatory power of the proposed new answer as compared with the best 
theory or conjecture previously proposed in the field This logical measure is essentially the same thing which I have 
described above as the logical criterion of potential satisfactoriness and of progress 

My description of this situation might tempt some people to say that truth does not after all play a very big role with 
us negativists even as a regulative principle There can be no doubt they will say that negativists like myself much 
prefer an attempt to solve an interesting problem by a bold conjecture even if it soon turns out to be false to 
any recital of a sequence of true but uninteresting assertions Thus it does not seem after all as if we negativists had 
much use for the idea of truth Our ideas of scientific progress and of attempted problemsolving do not seem very 
closely related to it 

This I believe would give quite a mistaken impression of the attitude of our group Call us negativists or what you 
like but you should realize that we are as much interested in truth as anybodyfor example as the members of a 
court of justice When the judge tells a witness that he should speak The truth the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth then what he looks for is as much of the relevant truth as the witness may be able to offer A witness who 
likes to wander off into irrelevancies is unsatisfactory as a witness even though these irrelevancies may be truisms 
and thus part of the whole truth It is quite obvious that what the judgeor anybody elsewants when he asks for the 
whole truth is as much interesting and relevant true information as can be got and many perfectly candid 
witnesses have failed to disclose some important information simply because they were unaware of its relevance to 
the case 

Thus when we stress with Busch that we are not interested in mere truth but in interesting and relevant truth then I 
contend we only emphasize a point which everybody accepts And if we are interested in bold conjectures 

 
 From W Busch Schein und Sein first published posthumously in  p  of the Insel edition My 
attention has been drawn to this rhyme by an essay on Busch as a philosopher which my late friend Julius Kraft 
contributed to the volume Erziehung uncl Politik Essays for Minna Specht  see p  My translation 
makes it perhaps more like a nursery rhyme than Busch intended 

 

 

even if these should soon turn out to be false then this interest is due to our methodological conviction that only with 
the help of such bold conjectures can we hope to discover interesting and relevant truth 

There is a point here which I suggest it is the particular task of the logician to analyse Interest or relevance in the 
sense here intended can be objectively analysed it is relative to our problems and it depends on the explanatory 
power and thus on the content or improbability of the information The measures alluded to earlier and developed in 
the Addenda to this volume are precisely such measures as take account of some relative content of the 
informationits content relative to a hypothesis or to a problem 

I can therefore gladly admit that falsificationists like myself much prefer an attempt to solve an interesting problem by 
a bold conjecture even and especially if it soon turns out to be false to any recital of a sequence of 
irrelevant truisms We prefer this because we believe that this is the way in which we can learn from our mistakes 
and that in finding that our conjecture was false we shall have learnt much about the truth and shall have got nearer 
to the truth 

I therefore hold that both ideasthe idea of truth in the sense of correspondence with the facts and the idea of 
content which may be measured by the same measure as testabilityplay about equally important roles in our 
considerations and that both can shed much light on the idea of progress in science 

X 

Looking at the progress of scientific knowledge many people have been moved to say that even though we do not 
know how near or how far we are from the truth we can and often do approach more and more closely to 
the truth I myself have sometimes said such things in the past but always with a twinge of bad conscience Not 
that I believe in being overfussy about what we say as long as we speak as clearly as we can yet do not pretend 
that what we are saying is clearer than it is and as long as we do not try to derive apparently exact consequences 
from dubious or vague premises there is no harm whatever in occasional vagueness or in voicing every now and 
then our feelings and general intuitive impressions about things Yet whenever I used to write or to say something 
about science as getting nearer to the truth or as a kind of approach to truth I felt that I really ought to be writing 
Truth with a capital T in order to make quite clear that a vague and highly metaphysical notion was involved here 
in contradistinction to Tarskis truth which we can with a clear conscience write in the ordinary way with small letters 
 

It was only quite recently that I set myself to consider whether the idea of truth involved here was really so 
dangerously vague and metaphysical after 

 
 Similar misgivings are expressed by Quine when he criticizes Peirce for operating with the idea of approaching to 
truth See W V Quine Word and Object New York  p  

 

 

all Almost at once I found that it was not and that there was no particular difficulty in applying Tarskis fundamental 
idea to itFor there is no reason whatever why we should not say that one theory corresponds better to the facts than 
another This simple initial step makes everything clear there really is no barrier here between what at first sight 
appeared to be Truth with a capital T and truth in a Tarskian senseBut can we really speak about better 
correspondence Are there such things as degrees of truth Is it not dangerously misleading to talk as if Tarskian 
truth were located somewhere in a kind of metrical or at least topological space so that we can sensibly say of two 
theoriessay an earlier theory t  and a later theory t  that t  has superseded t  or progressed beyond t  by 
approaching more closely to the truth than t I do not think that this kind of talk is at all misleading On the contrary I 
believe that we simply cannot do without something like this idea of a better or worse approximation to truth For 
there is no doubt whatever that we can say and often want to say of a theory t  that it corresponds better to the 
facts or that as far as we know it seems to correspond better to the facts than another theory t I shall give here a 
somewhat unsystematic list of six types of case in which we should be inclined to say of a theory t  that it is 
superseded by t  in the sense that t  seemsas far as we knowto correspond better to the facts than t  in some 
sense or other 
 
 

t  makes more precise assertions than t  and these more precise assertions stand up to more precise tests 
t  takes account of and explains more facts than t  which will include for example the above case that other 
things being equal t  s assertions are more precise 
t  describes or explains the facts in more detail than t  
t  has passed tests which t  has failed to pass 
t  has suggested new experimental tests not considered before t  was designed and not suggested by t  
and perhaps not even applicable to t   and t  has passed these tests 
t  has unified or connected various hitherto unrelated problems 

 
 
 

 

If we reflect upon this list then we can see that the contents of the theories t  and t  play an important role in it It 
will be remembered that the logical content of a statement or a theory a is the class of all statements which follow 
logically from a while I have defined the empirical content of a as the class of all basic statements which 
contradict a   For in our list of six cases the empirical content of theory t  exceeds that of theory t  

This suggests that we combine here the ideas of truth and of content into 

 
 This definition is logically justified by the theorem that so far as the empirical part of the logical content is 
concerned comparison of empirical contents and of logical contents always yield the same results and it is 
intuitively justified by the consideration that a statement a tells the more about our world of experience the more 
possible experiences it excludes or forbids About basic statements see also the Addenda to this volume 

 

 

onethe idea of a degree of better or worse correspondence to truth or of greater or less likeness or similarity to 
truth or to use a term already mentioned above in contradistinction to probability the idea of degrees of 
verisimilitudeIt should be noted that the idea that every statement or theory is not only either true or false but has 
independently of its truth value some degree of verisimilitude does not give rise to any multivalued logicthat is to 
a logical system with more than two truth values true and false though some of the things the defenders of multi
valued logic are hankering after seem to be realized by the theory of verisimilitude and related theories alluded to in 
section  of the Addenda to this volume 
XI 
Once I had seen the problem it did not take me long to get to this point But strangely enough it took me a long time 
to put two and two together and to proceed from here to a very simple definition of verisimilitude in terms of 
truth and of content We can use either logical or empirical content and thus obtain two closely related ideas of 
verisimilitude which however merge into one if we consider here only empirical theories or empirical aspects of 
theoriesLet us consider the content of a statement a that is the class of all the logical consequences of A If a is 
true then this class can consist only of true statements because truth is always transmitted from a premise to all its 
conclusions But if a is false then its content will always consist of both true and false conclusions Example It 
always rains on Sundays is false but its conclusion that it rained last Sunday happens to be true Thus whether a 
statement is true or false there may be more truth or less truth in what it says according to whether its 
content consists of a greater or a lesser number of true statementsLet us call the class of the true logical 
consequences of a the truthcontent of a a German term Wahrheitsgehaltreminiscent of the phrase there is 
truth in what you sayof which truthcontent may be said to be a translation has been intuitively used for a long 
time and let us call the class of the false consequences of abut only thesethe falsitycontent of a The falsity
content is not strictly speaking a content because it does not contain any of the true conclusions of the false 
statements which form its elements Yet it is possiblesee the Addendato define its measure with the help of two 
contents These terms are precisely as objective as the terms true or false and content themselves Now we can 
sayAssuming that the truthcontent and the falsitycontent of two theories t  and t  are 
comparable we can say that t  is more closely similar to the truth or corresponds better to the 
facts than t  if and only if either 
a 
b 

the truthcontent but not the falsitycontent of t  exceeds that of t  
the falsitycontent of t  but not its truthcontent exceeds that of t  

If we now work with the perhaps fictitious assumption that the content and 

 

 

truthcontent of a theory a are in principle measurable then we can go slightly beyond this definition and can 
define Vsa that is to say a measure of the verisimilitude or truthlikeness of a The simplest definition will 
beVsa  Ct T aCt F awhere Ct T a is a measure of the truthcontent of a and Ct F a is a measure of the 
falsitycontent of a A slightly more complicated but in some respects preferable definition will be found in section  of 
the Addenda to the present volumeIt is obvious that Vsa satisfies our two demands according to which Vsa 
should increase 
a 
b 

if Ct T a increases while Ct F a does not and 
if Ct F a decreases while Ct T a does not 

Some further considerations of a slightly technical nature and the definitions of Ct T a and especially Ct F a and 
Vsa will be found in the Addenda Here I want only to discuss three nontechnical points 

XII 

The first point is this Our idea of approximation to truth or of verisimilitude has the same objective character and the 
same ideal or regulative character as the idea of objective or absolute truth It is not an epistemological or an 
epistemic ideano more than truth or content In Tarskis terminology it is obviously a semantic idea like truth 
or like logical consequence and therefore content Accordingly we have here again to distinguish between the 
question What do you intend to say if you say that the theory t  has a higher degree of verisimilitude than the theory 
t  and the question How do you know that the theory t  has a higher degree of verisimilitude than the theory t  

We have so far answered only the first of these questions The answer to the second question depends on it and it is 
exactly analogous to the following absolute rather than comparative question about truth I do not knowI only 
guess But I can examine my guess critically and if it withstands severe criticism then this fact may be taken as a 
good critical reason in favour of it 

My second point is this Verisimilitude is so defined that maximum verisimilitude would be achieved only by a theory 
which is not only true but completely comprehensively true if it corresponds to all facts as it were and of course 
only to real facts This is of course a much more remote and unattainable ideal than a mere correspondence with 
some facts as in say Snow is usually white 

But all this holds only for the maximum degree of verisimilitude and not for the comparison of theories with 
respect to their degree of verisimilitude This comparative use of the idea is its main point and the idea of a 
higher or lower degree of verisimilitude seems less remote and more applicable and therefore perhaps more 
important for the analysis of scientific methods than thein itself much more fundamentalidea of absolute truth itself 

 

 

This leads me to my third point Let me first say that I do not suggest that the explicit introduction of the idea of 
verisimilitude will lead to any changes in the theory of method On the contrary I think that my theory of testability or 
corroboration by empirical tests is the proper methodological counterpart to this new metalogical idea The only 
improvement is one of clarification Thus I have often said that we prefer the theory t  which has passed certain 
severe tests to the theory t  which has failed these tests because a false theory is certainly worse than one which 
for all we know may be true 

To this we can now add that even after t  has been refuted in its turn we can still say that it is better than t  for 
although both have been shown to be false the fact that t  has withstood tests which t  did not pass may be a good 
indication that the falsitycontent of t  exceeds that of t  while its truthcontent does not Thus we may still give 
preference to t  even after its falsification because we have reason to think that it agrees better with the facts than 
did t  

All cases where we accept t  because of experiments which were crucial between t  and t  seem to be of this kind 
and especially all cases where the experiments were found by trying to think out with the help of t  cases where t  
leads to other results than did t  Thus Newtons theory allowed us to predict some deviations from Keplers laws Its 
success in this field established that it did not fail in cases which refuted Keplers at least the now known falsity
content of Keplers theory was not part of Newtons while it was pretty clear that the truthcontent could not have 
shrunk since Keplers theory followed from Newtons as a first approximation 

Similarly a theory t  which is more precise than t  can now be shown to havealways provided its falsity content 
does not exceed that of t  a higher degree of verisimilitude than t  The same will hold for t  whose numerical 
assertions though false come nearer to the true numerical values than those of t  

Ultimately the idea of verisimilitude is most important in cases where we know that we have to work with theories 
which are at best approximationsthat is to say theories of which we actually know that they cannot be true This is 
often the case in the social sciences In these cases we can still speak of better or worse approximations to the truth 
and we therefore do not need to interpret these cases in an instrumentalist sense 

XIII 

It always remains possible of course that we shall make mistakes in our relative appraisal of two theories and the 
appraisal will often be a controversial matter This point can hardly be overemphasized Yet it is also important that 
in principle and as long as there are no revolutionary changes in our background knowledge the relative appraisal of 
our two theories t  and t  will remain stable More particularly our preferences need not change as we have seen 
if we eventually refute the better of the two theories 

 

 

Newtons dynamics for example even though we may regard it as refuted has of course maintained its superiority 
over Keplers and Galileos theories The reason is its greater content or explanatory power Newtons theory 
continues to explain more facts than did the others to explain them with greater precision and to unify the previously 
unconnected problems of celestial and terrestrial mechanics The reason for the stability of relative appraisals such 
as these is quite simple the logical relation between the theories is of such a character that first of all there exist 
with respect to them those crucial experiments and these when carried out went against Newtons predecessors 
And secondly it is of such a character that the later refutations of Newtons theory could not support the older 
theories they either did not affect them or as with the perihelion motion of Mercury they could be claimed to refute 
the predecessors also 

I hope that I have explained the idea of better agreement with the facts or of degrees of verisimilitude sufficiently 
clearly for the purpose of this brief survey 

XIV 

A brief remark on the early history of the confusion between verisimilitude and probability may perhaps be 
appropriate here 

As we have seen progress in science means progress towards more interesting less trivial and therefore less 
probable theories where probable is taken in any sense such as lack of content or statistical frequency that 
satisfies the calculus of probability and this means as a rule progress towards less familiar and less comfortable or 
plausible theories Yet the idea of greater verisimilitude of a better approximation to the truth is usually confused 
intuitively with the totally different idea of probability in its various senses of more likely than not more often than 
not seems likely to be true sounds plausible sounds convincing The confusion is a very old one We have only 
to remember some of the other words for probable such as likely which comes originally from like the truth or 
verisimilar eoikots eikots eikos etc in Greek verisimilis in Latin wahrscheinlich in German in 
order to see some of the traces and perhaps some of the sources of this confusion 

Two at least of the earliest of the Presocratic philosophers used eoikota in the sense of like the truth or similar to 
the truth Thus we read in Xenophanes DK B  These things let us suppose are like the truth 

It is fairly clear that verisimilitude or truthlikeness is meant here rather than probability or degree of incomplete 
certainty Otherwise the words let us suppose or let it be conjectured or let it be imagined would be redundant 
and Xenophanes would have written something like These things let it be said are probable 

Using the same word eoikota Parmenides wrote DK B    

 

 In this fragment eoikota has been most frequently translated as probable or plausible For example W Kranz 
in DielsKranz Fragmente der Vorsokratiker th edn translates it wahrscheinlich
einleuchtend that is probable and plausible he reads the passage thus This world
arrangement or worldorder I shall expound to you in all its parts as something probable 
and plausible In translating wholly like truth or wholly like the truth I am somewhat 
influenced by the line DK B  quoted above from Xenophanes and also by K Reinhardt 
Parmenides p  f where Willamovitz is referred to See also section vii of the Introduction 
to the present volume the quotation from Osiander in section i of ch  and section xii of ch 
 above 

 

 

Now of this world thus arranged to seem wholly like truth I shall tell you     

Yet already in the same generation or the next Epicharmus in a criticism of Xenophanes seems to have used the 
word eikots in the sense of plausible or something like it DK  A  though the possibility cannot be 
excluded that he may have used it in the sense of like the truth and that it was Aristotle our source is Met a 
who read it in the sense of plausible or likely Some three generations later however eikos is used quite 
unambiguously in the sense of likely or probable or perhaps even of more frequently than not by the sophist 
Antiphon when he writes DK B  If one begins a thing well it is likely to end well 

All this suggests that the confusion between verisimilitude and probability goes back almost to the beginning of 
Western philosophy and this is understandable if we consider that Xenophanes stressed the fallibility of our 
knowledge which he described as uncertain guesswork and at best like the truth This phrase it seems lent itself to 
misinterpretation as uncertain and at best of some fair degree of certaintythat is probable 

Xenophanes himself seems to have distinguished clearly between degrees of certainty and degrees of truthlikeness 
This emerges from another fragment quoted above towards the end of chapter  p   which says that even if by 
chance we were to hit upon and pronounce the final truth that is we may add perfect truthlikeness we should not 
know it Thus great uncertainty is compatible with greatest truthlikeness 

I suggest that we return to Xenophanes and reintroduce a clear distinction between verisimilitude and 
probability using this latter term in the sense laid down by the calculus of probability 

The differentiation between these two ideas is the more important as they have become confused because both are 
closely related to the idea of truth and both introduce the idea of an approach to truth by degrees Logical probability 
we do not discuss here physical probability represents the idea of approaching logical certainty or tautological truth 
through a gradual diminution of informative content Verisimilitude on the other hand represents the idea of 
approaching comprehensive truth It thus combines truth and content while probability combines truth with lack of 
content  

The feeling that it is absurd to deny that science aims at probability stems I suggest from a misguided intuition
from the intuitive confusion between the two notions of verisimilitude and of probability which as it now turns out are 
utterly different 

 
 This incidentally holds for both absolute probability pa and relative probability pa b and there are 
corresponding absolute and relative concepts of verisimilitude 

 

 

 BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENTIFIC 
GROWTH 
XV 

People involved in a fruitful critical discussion of a problem often rely if only unconsciously upon two things the 
acceptance by all parties of the common aim of getting at the truth or at least nearer to the truth and a considerable 
amount of common background knowledge This does not mean that either of these two things is an indispensible 
basis of every discussion or that these two things are themselves a priori and cannot be critically discussed in 
their turn It only means that criticism never starts from nothing even though every one of its starting points may be 
challenged one at a time in the course of the critical debate 

Yet though every one of our assumptions may be challenged it is quite impracticable to challenge all of them at the 
same time Thus all criticism must be piecemeal as against the holistic view of Duhem and of Quine which is only 
another way of saying that the fundamental maxim of every critical discussion is that we should stick to our problem 
and that we should subdivide it if practicable and try to solve no more than one problem at a time although we may 
of course always proceed to a subsidiary problem or replace our problem by a better one 

While discussing a problem we always accept if only temporarily all kinds of things as unproblematic they 
constitute for the time being and for the discussion of this particular problem what I call our background 
knowledge Few parts of this background knowledge will appear to us in all contexts as absolutely unproblematic 
and any particular part of it may be challenged at any time especially if we suspect that its uncritical acceptance 
may be responsible for some of our difficulties But almost all of the vast amount of background knowledge which we 
constantly use in any informal discussion will for practical reasons necessarily remain unquestioned and the 
misguided attempt to question it allthat is to say to start from scratchcan easily lead to the breakdown of a 
critical debate Were we to start the race where Adam started I know of no reason why we should get any further 
than Adam did 

XVI 

The fact that as a rule we are at any given moment taking a vast amount of traditional knowledge for granted for 
almost all our knowledge is traditional creates no difficulty for the falsificationist or fallibilist For he does not accept 
this background knowledge neither as established nor as fairly certain nor yet as probable He knows that even its 
tentative acceptance is risky and stresses that every bit of it is open to criticism even though only in a piecemeal 
way We can never be certain that we shall challenge the right bit but since our quest is not for certainty this does 
not matter It will be noticed that this remark contains my answer to Quines holistic view of empirical tests a view 
which Quine formulates with reference to Duhem by asserting that our statements about the external world face the 
tribunal of sense experience 

 

 

not individually but only as a corporate body  Now it has to be admitted that we can often test only a large chunk of 
a theoretical system and sometimes perhaps only the whole system and that in these cases it is sheer guesswork 
which of its ingredients should be held responsible for any falsification a point which I have tried to emphasizealso 
with reference to Duhemfor a long time past  Though this argument may turn a verificationist into a sceptic it 
does not affect those who hold that all our theories are guesses anyway 

This shows that the holistic view of tests even if it were true would not create a serious difficulty for the fallibilist and 
falsificationist On the other hand it should be said that the holistic argument goes much too far It is possible in quite 
a few cases to find which hypothesis is responsible for the refutation or in other words which part or group of 
hypotheses was necessary for the derivation of the refuted prediction The fact that such logical dependencies may 
be discovered is established by the practice of independence proofs of axiomatized systems proofs which show 
that certain axioms of an axiomatic system cannot be derived from the rest The more simple of these proofs consist 
in the construction or rather in the discovery of a modela set of things relations operations or functionswhich 
satisfies all the axioms except the one whose independence is to be shown for this one axiomand therefore for the 
theory as a wholethe model constitutes a counter example 

Now let us say that we have an axiomatized theoretical system for example of physics which allows us to predict 
that certain things do not happen and that we discover a counter example There is no reason whatever why this 
counter example may not be found to satisfy most of our axioms or even all our axioms except one whose 
independence would be thus established This shows that the holistic dogma of the global character of all tests or 
counter examples is untenable And it explains why even without axiomatizing our physical theory we may well have 
an inkling of what has gone wrong with our system 

This incidentally speaks in favour of operating in physics with highly analysed theoretical systemsthat is with 
systems which even though they may fuse all the hypotheses into one allow us to separate various groups of 
hypotheses each of which may become an object of refutation by counter examples An excellent recent example is 
the rejection in atomic theory of the law of parity another is the rejection of the law of commutation for conjugate 
variables prior to their interpretation as matrices and to the statistical interpretation of these matrices 

XVII 

One fact which is characteristic of the situation in which the scientist finds himself is that we constantly add to our 
background knowledge If we discard 

 
 See W V Quine From a Logical Point of View  p  
 See my LScD especially sections  to  and this volume ch  text to note  

 

some parts of it others closely related to them will remain For example even though we may regard Newtons 
theory as refutedthat is his system of ideas and the formal deductive system which derives from itwe may still 
assume as part of our background knowledge the approximate truth within limits of its quantitative formulae 

The existence of this background knowledge plays an important role in one of the arguments which support I 
believe my thesis that the rational and empirical character of science would vanish if it ceased to progress I can 
sketch this argument here only in its barest outline 

A serious empirical test always consists in the attempt to find a refutation a counter example In the search for a 
counter example we have to use our background knowledge for we always try to refute first the most risky 
predictions the most unlikely   consequences as Peirce already saw   which means that we always look in 
the most probable kinds of places for the most probable kinds of counter examplesmost probable in the 
sense that we should expect to find them in the light of our background knowledge Now if a theory stands up to 
many such tests then owing to the incorporation of the results of our tests into our background knowledge there 
may be after a time no places left where in the light of our new background knowledge counter examples can with 
a high probability be expected to occur But this means that the degree of severity of our test declines This is also 
the reason why an often repeated test will no longer be considered as significant or as severe there is something like 
a law of diminishing returns from repeated tests as opposed to tests which in the light of our background knowledge 
are of a new kind and which therefore may still be felt to be significant These are facts which are inherent in the 
knowledgesituation and they have often been describedespecially by John Maynard Keynes and by Ernest Nagel
as difficult to explain by an inductivist theory of science But for us it is all very easy And we can even explain by a 
similar analysis of the knowledgesituation why the empirical character of a very successful theory always grows 
stale after a time We may then feel as Poincar did with respect to Newtons theory that the theory is nothing but a 
set of implicit definitions or conventionsuntil we progress again and by refuting it incidentally reestablish its lost 
empirical character De mortuis nil nisi bene once a theory is refuted its empirical character is secure and 
shines without blemish 

 THREE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GROWTH OF 
KNOWLEDGE 
XVIII 

But let us return again to the idea of getting nearer to the truthto the search for theories which agree better with the 
facts as indicated by the list of six comparisons in section x above 

 
 See the Collected Papers of C S Peirce vol vii  and  I owe this reference to W B Gallie cp 
Philosophy   p  and a similar one to David Rynin 

 

 

 

What is the general problem situation in which the scientist finds himself He has before him a scientific problem he 
wants to find a new theory capable of explaining certain experimental facts facts which the earlier theories 
successfully explained others which they could not explain and some by which they were actually falsified The new 
theory should also resolve if possible some theoretical difficulties such as how to dispense with certain ad hoc 
hypotheses or how to unify two theories Now if he manages to produce a theory which is a solution to all these 
problems his achievement will be very great 

Yet it is not enough I have been asked What more do you want My answer is that there are many more things 
which I want or rather which I think are required by the logic of the general problem situation in which the scientist 
finds himself by the task of getting nearer to the truth I shall confine myself here to the discussion of three such 
requirements 

The first requirement is this The new theory should proceed from some simple new and powerful unifying 
idea about some connection or relation such as gravitational attraction between hitherto unconnected things such 
as planets and apples or facts such as inertial and gravitational mass or new theoretical entities such as field and 
particles This requirement of simplicity is a bit vague and it seems difficult to formulate it very clearly It seems 
to be intimately connected with the idea that our theories should describe the structural properties of the worldan 
idea which it is hard to think out fully without getting involved in an infinite regress This is so because any idea of a 
particular structure of the worldunless indeed we think of a purely mathematical structurealready presupposes 
a universal theory for example explaining the laws of chemistry by interpreting molecules as structures of atoms or 
of subatomic particles presupposes the idea of universal laws that regulate the properties and the behaviour of the 
atoms or of the particles Yet one important ingredient in the idea of simplicity can be logically analysed It is the 
idea of testability  This leads us immediately to our second requirement 

For secondly we require that the new theory should be independently testable  That is to say apart from 
explaining all the explicanda which the new theory was designed to explain it must have new and testable 
consequences preferably consequences of a new kind it must lead to the prediction of phenomena which have 
not so far been observed 

This requirement seems to me indispensable since without it our new theory might be ad hoc for it is always 
possible to produce a theory to fit any 

 
 See sections  to  of my LScD I may perhaps mention here that the idea of simplicity in spite of the fact 
that it is intuitively connected with the idea of a unified or coherent system or a theory that springs from one 
intuitive picture of the facts cannot be formally analysed in terms of numerical paucity of hypotheses For every 
theory can be formulated in one statement in fact it looks as if we might for every natural number n axiomatize 
every theory in the form of n independent axioms though perhaps not necessarily organic axioms in the sense 
of the Warsaw School 
 For a discussion of the idea of an independent test see my paper The Aim of Science Ratio   p 
 ff 

 

 

given set of explicanda Thus our two first requirements are needed in order to restrict the range of our choice among 
the possible solutions many of them uninteresting of the problem in hand 

If our second requirement is satisfied then our new theory will represent a potential step forward whatever the 
outcome of the new tests may be For it will be better testable than the previous theory the fact that it explains all the 
explicanda of the previous theory and that in addition it gives rise to new tests suffices to ensure this 

Moreover the second requirement also ensures that our new theory will to some extent be fruitful as an instrument 
of exploration That is to say it will suggest to us new experiments and even if these should at once lead to the 
refutation of the theory our factual knowledge will have grown through the unexpected results of the new 
experiments Moreover they will confront us with new problems to be solved by new explanatory theories 

Yet I believe that there must be a third requirement for a good theory It is this We require that the theory should 
pass some new and severe tests 

XIX 

Clearly this requirement is totally different in character from the previous two These could be seen to be fulfilled or 
not fulfilled largely by analysing the old and the new theories logically They are formal requirements The third 
requirement on the other hand can be found to be fulfilled or not fulfilled only by testing the new theory empirically 
It is a material requirement a requirement of empirical success 

Moreover the third requirement clearly cannot be indispensable in the same sense as are the two previous ones For 
these two are indispensable for deciding whether the theory in question should be at all accepted as a serious 
candidate for examination by empirical tests or in other words whether it is an interesting and promising theory Yet 
on the other hand some of the most interesting and most admirable theories ever conceived were refuted at the very 
first test And why not The most promising theory may fail if it makes predictions of a new kind An example is the 
marvellous theory of Bohr Kramers and Slater of   which as an intellectual achievement might almost rank 
with Bohrs quantum theory of the hydrogen atom of  Yet unfortunately it was almost at once refuted by the 
factsby the coincidence experiments of Bothe and Geiger  This shows that not even the greatest physicist can 
anticipate the secrets of nature his inspirations can only be guesses and it is no fault of his or of his theory if it is 
refuted Even Newtons theory was in the end refuted and indeed we hope that we shall in this way succeed in 
refuting and improving upon every new theory And if it is refuted in the end why not in the beginning One might 
well say that it is merely a historical accident if a theory is refuted after six months rather than after six years or six 
hundred years

 Zeitschr f Phys   pp  ff 

 

 

Refutations have often been regarded as establishing the failure of a scientist or at least of his theory It should be 
stressed that this is an inductivist error Every refutation should be regarded as a great success not merely a 
success of the scientist who refuted the theory but also of the scientist who created the refuted theory and who thus 
in the first instance suggested if only indirectly the refuting experiment 

Even if a new theory such as the theory of Bohr Kramers and Slater should meet an early death it should not be 
forgotten rather its beauty should be remembered and history should record our gratitude to itfor bequeathing to us 
new and perhaps still unexplained experimental facts and with them new problems and for the services it has thus 
rendered to the progress of science during its successful but short life 

All this indicates clearly that our third requirement is not indispensable even a theory which fails to meet it can make 
an important contribution to science Yet in a different sense I hold it is indispensable none the less  Bohr Kramers 
and Slater rightly aimed at more than making an important contribution to science 

In the first place I contend that further progress in science would become impossible if we did not reasonably often 
manage to meet the third requirement thus if the progress of science is to continue and its rationality not to decline 
we need not only successful refutations but also positive successes We must that is manage reasonably often to 
produce theories that entail new predictions especially predictions of new effects new testable consequences 
suggested by the new theory and never thought of before  Such a new prediction was that planets would under 
certain circumstances deviate from Keplers laws or that light in spite of its zero mass would prove to be subject to 
gravitational attraction that is Einsteins eclipseeffect Another example is Diracs prediction that there will be an 
antiparticle for every elementary particle New predictions of these kinds must not only be produced but they must 
also be reasonably often corroborated by experimental evidence I contend if scientific progress is to continue 

We do need this kind of success it is not for nothing that the great theories of science have all meant a new conquest 
of the unknown a new success in predicting what had never been thought of before We need successes such as 
that of Dirac whose antiparticles have survived the abandonment of some other parts of his theories or that of 
Yukawas meson theory We need the success the empirical corroboration of some of our theories if only in order to 
appreciate the significance of successful and stirring refutations like that of parity It seems to me quite clear that it 
is only through these temporary successes of our theories that we can be reasonably successful in attributing our 
refutations to definite portions of the theoretical maze For we are reasonably successful in thisa fact which must 
remain inexplicable for one who adopts Duhems and Quines views on the matter An unbroken 

 
  have drawn attention to new predictions of this kind and to their philosophical significance in ch  See 
especially pp  f 

 

 

sequence of refuted theories would soon leave us bewildered and helpless we should have no clue about the parts 
of each of these theoriesor of our background knowledgeto which we might tentatively attribute the failure of that 
theory 

XX 

Earlier I suggested that science would stagnate and lose its empirical character if we should fail to obtain 
refutations We can now see that for very similar reasons science would stagnate and lose its empirical character if 
we should fail to obtain verifications of new predictions that is if we should only manage to produce theories that 
satisfy our first two requirements but not the third For suppose we were to produce an unbroken sequence of 
explanatory theories each of which would explain all the explicanda in its field including the experiments which 
refuted its predecessors each would also be independently testable by predicted new effects yet each would be at 
once refuted when these predictions were put to the test Thus each would satisfy our first two requirements but all 
would fail to satisfy the third 

I assert that in this case we should feel that we were producing a sequence of theories which in spite of their 
increasing degree of testability were ad hoc and that we were not getting any nearer to the truth And indeed this 
feeling may well be justified this whole sequence of theories might easily be ad hoc For if it is admitted that a 
theory may be ad hoc if it is not independently testable by experiments of a new kind but merely explains all the 
explicanda including the experiments which refuted its predecessors then it is clear that the mere fact that the theory 
is also independently testable cannot as such ensure that it is not ad hoc This becomes clear if we consider that it 
is always possible by a trivial stratagem to make an ad hoc theory independently testable if we do not also 
require that it should pass the independent tests in question we merely have to connect it 
conjunctively in some way or other with any testable but not yet tested fantastic ad hoc prediction which may occur 
to us or to some science fiction writer 

Thus our third requirement like the second is needed in order to eliminate trivial and other ad hoc theories  But it 
is needed also for what seem to me even more serious reasons 

I think that we are quite right to expect and perhaps even to hope that even our best theories will be superseded and 
replaced by better ones though 

 
 Dr Jerzy Giedymin in a paper A Generalization of the Refutability Postulate Studia Logica   see 
especially pp  ff has formulated a general methodological principle of empiricism which says that our various 
rules of scientific method must not permit what he calls a dictatorial strategy that is they must exclude the 
possibility that we shall always win the game played in accordance with these rules Nature must be able to 
defeat us at least sometimes If we drop our third requirement then we can always win and need not consider 
Nature at all as far as the construction of good theories is concerned speculations about answers which Nature 
may give to our questions will play no role in our problem situation which will always be fully determined by our 
past failures alone 

 

 

we may at the same time feel the need for encouragement in our belief that we are making progress Yet this should 
certainly not induce in us the attitude of merely producing theories so that they can be superseded 

For our aim as scientists is to discover the truth about our problem and we must look at our theories as serious 
attempts to find the truth If they are not true they may be admittedly important stepping stones towards the truth 
instruments for further discoveries But this does not mean that we can ever be content to look at them as being 
nothing but stepping stones nothing but instruments for this would involve giving up even the view that they are 
instruments of theoretical discoveries it would commit us to looking upon them as mere instruments for some 
observational or pragmatic purpose And this approach would not I suspect be very successful even from a 
pragmatic point of view if we are content to look at our theories as mere stepping stones then most of them will not 
even be good stepping stones Thus we ought not to aim at theories which are mere instruments for the exploration 
of facts but we ought to try to find genuine explanatory theories we should make genuine guesses about the 
structure of the world In brief we should not be satisfied with the first two requirements 

Of course the fulfilment of our third requirement is not in our own hands No amount of ingenuity can ensure the 
construction of a successful theory We also need luck and we also need a world whose mathematical structure is 
not so intricate as to make progress impossible For indeed if we should cease to progress in the sense of our third 
requirementif we should only succeed in refuting our theories but not in obtaining some verifications of predictions of 
a new kindwe might well decide that our scientific problems have become too difficult for us because the structure if 
any of the world is beyond our powers of comprehension Even in this case we might proceed for a time with theory 
construction criticism and falsification the rational side of the method of science might for a time continue to 
function Yet I believe that we should feel that especially for the functioning of its empirical side both kinds of 
successes are essential success in refuting our theories and success on the part of some of our theories in resisting 
at least some of our most determined attempts to refute them 

XXI 

It may be objected that this is merely good psychological advice about the attitude which scientists ought to adopta 
matter which after all is their private affairand that a theory of scientific method worthy of its name should be able 
to produce logical or methodological arguments in support of our third requirement Instead of appealing to the 
attitude or the psychology of the scientist our theory of science should even be able to explain his attitude and his 
psychology by an analysis of the logic of the situation in which he finds himself There is a problem here for our 
theory of method 

I accept this challenge and I shall produce three reasons the first from the idea of truth the second from the idea of 
getting nearer to the truth 

 

 

verisimilitude and the third from our old idea of independent tests and of crucial tests 

The first reason why our third requirement is so important is this We know that if we had an independently 
testable theory which was moreover true then it would provide us with successful predictions 
and only with successful ones Successful predictionsthough they are not of course sufficient conditions for 
the truth of a theoryare therefore at least necessary conditions for the truth of an independently testable theory In 
this senseand only in this senseour third requirement may even be said to be necessary if we seriously accept 
truth as a regulative idea 

The second reason is this If it is our aim to strengthen the verisimilitude of our theories or to get nearer to the 
truth then we should be anxious not only to reduce the falsity content of our theories but also to strengthen their truth 
content 

Admittedly this may be done in certain cases simply by constructing the new theory in such a way that the refutations 
of the old theory are explained saving the phenomena in this case the refutations But there are other cases of 
scientific progresscases whose existence shows that this way of increasing the truth content is not the only possible 
one 

The cases I have in mind are cases in which there was no refutation Neither Galileos nor Keplers theories were 
refuted before Newton what Newton tried to do was to explain them from more general assumptions and thus to 
unify two hitherto unrelated fields of inquiry The same may be said of many other theories Ptolemys system was not 
refuted when Copernicus produced his And though there was before Einstein the puzzling experiment of Michelson 
and Morely this had been successfully explained by Lorentz and Fitzgerald 

It is in cases like these that crucial experiments become decisively important We have no reason to regard the 
new theory as better than the old theoryto believe that it is nearer to the truthuntil we have derived from the new 
theory new predictions which were unobtainable from the old theory the phases of Venus the perturbations the 
massenergy equation and until we have found that these new predictions were successful For it is only this 
success which shows that the new theory had true consequences that is a truth content where the old theories had 
false consequences that is a falsity content 

Had the new theory been refuted in any of these crucial experiments then we should have had no reason to abandon 
the old one in its favoureven if the old theory was not wholly satisfactory This was the fate of the BohrKramers
Slater theory 

In all these important cases we need the new theory in order to find out where the old theory was deficient 
Admittedly the situation is different if the deficiency of the old theory is already known before the new theory is 
invented but logically the case has enough similarity with the other cases to regard a new theory which leads to new 
crucial experiments  Einsteins mass 

 

 

energy equation as superior to one which can only save the known phenomena  LorentzFitzgerald 

The same pointthe importance of crucial testscan be made without appealing to the aim of increasing the 
verisimilitude of a theory by using an old argument of minethe need to make the tests of our explanations 
independent  This need is a result of the growth of knowledgeof the incorporation of what was new and 
problematic knowledge into background knowledge with a consequent loss of explanatory power to our theories 

These are my main arguments 

XXII 

Our third requirement may be divided into two parts first we require of a good theory that it should be successful in 
some of its new predictions secondly we require that it is not refuted too soonthat is before it has been strikingly 
successful Both requirements sound strange The first because the logical relationship between a theory and any 
corroborating evidence cannot it seems be affected by the question whether the theory is temporally prior to the 
evidence The second because if the theory is doomed to be refuted its intrinsic value can hardly depend upon 
delaying the refutation 

Our explanation of this slightly puzzling difficulty is simple enough the successful new predictions which we require 
the new theory to produce are identical with the crucial tests which it must pass in order to become sufficiently 
interesting to be accepted as an advance upon its predecessor and to be considered worthy of further experimental 
examination which may eventually lead to its refutation 

Yet the difficulty can hardly be resolved by an inductivist methodology It is therefore not surprising that inductivists 
such as John Maynard Keynes have asserted that the value of predictions in the sense of facts derived from the 
theory but previously not known was imaginary and indeed if the value of a theory would lie merely in its relation to 
its evidential basis then it would be logically irrelevant whether the supporting evidence precedes or follows in time 
the invention of the theory Similarly the great founders of the hypothetical method used to stress the saving of the 
phenomena that is to say the demand that the theory should explain known experience Successful new 
predictionof new effectsseems to be a late idea for obvious reasons perhaps it was first mentioned by some 
pragmatist although the distinction between the prediction of known effects and the prediction of new effects was 
hardly ever made explicitly But it seems to me quite indispensable as a part of an epistemology which views science 
as progressing to better and better explanatory theories that is not merely to instruments of exploration but to 
genuine explanations 

Keynes objection that it is an historical accident whether this support was known before the theory was proposed or 
only afterwards so that it could attain the status of a prediction overlooks the allimportant fact that it is 

 
 See especially my paper The Aim of Science Ratio   

 

 

through our theories that we learn to observe that is to say to ask questions which lead to observations and to 
their interpretations This is the way our observational knowledge grows And the questions asked are as a rule 
crucial questions which may lead to answers that decide between competing theories It is my thesis that it is the 
growth of our knowledge our way of choosing between theories in a certain problem situation which makes 
science rational Now both the idea of the growth of knowledge and that of a problem situation are at least partly 
historical ideas This explains why another partly historical ideathat of a genuine prediction of evidence it may 
be about past facts not known when the theory was first proposedmay play an important role here and why the 
apparently irrelevant time element may become relevant  

I shall now briefly sum up our results with respect to the epistemologies of the two groups of philosophers I have dealt 
with the verificationists and the falsificationists 

While the verificationists or inductivists in vain try to show that scientific beliefs can be justified or at least 
established as probable and so encourage by their failure the retreat into irrationalism we of the other group have 
found that we do not even want a highly probable theory Equating rationality with the critical attitude we look for 
theories which however fallible progress beyond their predecessors which means that they can be more severely 
tested and stand up to some of the new tests And while the verificationists laboured in vain to discover valid positive 
arguments in support of their beliefs we for our part are satisfied that the rationality of a theory lies in the fact that we 
choose it because it is better than its predecessors because it can be put to more severe tests because it may even 
have passed them if we are fortunate and because it may therefore approach nearer to the truth 

APPENDIX A PRESUMABLY FALSE YET FORMALLY 
HIGHLY PROBABLE NONEMPIRICAL STATEMENT 

In the text of this chapter I have drawn attention to the criterion of progress and of rationality based on the 
comparison of degrees of testability or degrees of the empirical content or explanatory power of 
theories I did so because these degrees have been little discussed so far 

 
 Verificationists may think that the preceding discussion of what I have called here the third requirement quite 
unnecessarily elaborates what nobody contests Falsificationists may think otherwise and personally I feel greatly 
indebted to Dr Agassi for drawing my attention to the fact that I have previously never explained clearly the 
distinction between what are called here the second and third requirements He thus induced me to state it here in 
some detail I should mention however that he disagrees with me about the third requirement which as he 
explained to me he cannot accept because he can regard it only as a residue of verificationist modes of thought 
See also his paper in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy   where he expresses his 
disagreement on p  I admit that there may be a whiff of verification here but this seems to me a case where 
we have to put up with it if we do not want a whiff of some form of instrumentalism that takes theories to be mere 
instruments of exploration 

 

 

I always thought that the comparison of these degrees leads to a criterion which is more important and more realistic 
than the simpler criterion of falsifiability which I proposed at the same time and which has been widely 
discussed But this simpler criterion is also needed In order to show the need for the falsifiability or testability criterion 
as a criterion of the empirical character of scientific theories I will discuss as an example a simple purely existential 
statement which is formulated in purely empirical terms I hope this example will also provide a reply to the often 
repeated criticism that it is perverse to exclude purely existential statements from empirical science and to classify 
them as metaphysical 

My example consists of the following purely existential theory 

There exists a finite sequence of Latin elegiac couplets such that if it is pronounced in an appropriate manner at a 
certain time and place this is immediately followed by the appearance of the Devilthat is to say of a manlike 
creature with two small horns and one cloven hoof 

Clearly this untestable theory is in principle verifiable Though according to my criterion of demarcation it is 
excluded as nonempirical and nonscientific or if you like metaphysical it is not so excluded by those positivists who 
consider all wellformed statements and especially all verifiable ones as empirical and scientific 

Some of my positivist friends have indeed assured me that they consider my existential statement about the Devil to 
be empirical It is empirical though false they said And they indicated that I was mistaking false empirical statements 
for nonempirical ones 

However I think that the confusion if any is not mine I too believe that the existential statement is false but I believe 
that it is a false metaphysical statement And why I ask should anybody who takes it for empirical think that it is 
false Empirically it is irrefutable No observation in the world can establish its falsity There can be no empirical 
grounds for its falsity 

Moreover it can be easily shown to be highly probable like all existential statements it is in an infinite or sufficiently 
large universe almost logically true to use an expression of Carnaps Thus if we take it to be empirical we 
have no reason to reject it and every reason to accept it and to believe in itespecially upon a subjective theory of 
probable belief 

Probability theory tells us even more it can be easily proved not only that empirical evidence can never refute an 
almost logically true existential statement but that it can never reduce its probability Its probability could be 
reduced only by some information which is at least almost logically false and therefore not by an observational 
evidence statement So the empirical probability or degree of empirical confirmation in Carnaps sense of our 
statement about the devilsummoning spell must for ever remain equal to unity whatever the facts may be 

It would of course be easy enough for me to amend my criterion of 

 

 

demarcation so as to include such purely existential statements among the empirical statements I merely should 
have to admit not only testable or falsifiable statements among the empirical ones but also statements which may in 
principle be empirically verified 

But I believe that it is better not to amend my original falsifiability criterion For our example shows that if we do not 
wish to accept my existential statement about the spell that summons the devil we must deny its empirical character 
notwithstanding the fact that it can easily be formalized in any model language sufficient for the expression of even 
the most primitive scientific assertions By denying the empirical character of my existential statement I make it 
possible to reject it on grounds other than observational evidence See chapter  section  for a discussion of such 
grounds 

This shows that it is preferable as I have been trying to make clear for some considerable time not to assume 
uncritically that the terms empirical and wellformed or meaningful must coincideand that the situation is hardly 
improved if we assume uncritically that probability or probabilistic confirmability may be used as a criterion of the 
empirical character of statements or theories For a nonempirical and presumably false statement may have a high 
degree of probability as has been shown here

THE DEMARCATION BETWEEN SCIENCE AND METAPHYSICS 
Summary 

PUT in a nutshell my thesis amounts to this The repeated attempts made by Rudolf Carnap to show that the 
demarcation between science and metaphysics coincides with that between sense and nonsense have failed The 
reason is that the positivistic concept of meaning or sense or of verifiability or of inductive confirmability etc is 
inappropriate for achieving this demarcationsimply because metaphysics need not be meaningless even though is it 
not science In all its variants demarcation by meaninglessness has tended to be at the same time too narrow 
and too wide as against all intentions and all claims it has tended to exclude scientific theories as meaningless 
while failing to exclude even that part of metaphysics which is known as rational theology 

 INTRODUCTION 

WRITING about Carhopand in criticism of Carnapbrings back to my mind the time when I first met him at his 
Seminar in  or  It brings back even more vividly a later occasion in  in the beautiful Tyrolese hills 
when I had the opportunity of spending part of my holidays in prolonged critical discussions with Carnap and with 
Herbert Feigl in the company of our wives We had a happy time with plenty of sunshine and I think all 
tremendously enjoyed these long and fascinating talks interspersed 

 

A paper contributed in January  to the planned volume The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap of the 
Library of Living Philosophers ed P A Schilpp 

In view of the delay in the publication of the Carnap volume my contribution has been with the permission of the 
Professor Schilpp distributed in a stncilled version since June  Apart from small stylistic corrections I have 
made no changes in the text although since it was wriiten i have further developed a number of points in various 
publications see especially my Logic of Scientific Discovery new appendix IX especially pp  f the 
appendix to chapter  of the present volume an article in Dialectica   pp  and a Note in 
Mind   pp  

 

 

with a little climbing but never interrupted by it None of us will ever forget I am sure how Carnap once led us in a 
steep climb up a trackless hill through a beautiful and almost impenetrable thicket of alpine rhododendrons and how 
he led us at the same time through a beautiful and almost impenetrable thicket of arguments whose topic induced 
Feigl to christen our hill Semantische Schnuppe something like Semantical Shooting Starthough several 
years had to elapse before Carnap stimulated by Tarskis criticism discovered the track which led him from Logical 
Syntax to Semantics  

I found in Carnap not only one of the most captivating persons I had ever met but also a thinker utterly absorbed in 
and devoted to his problems and eager to listen to criticism And indeed among some other characteristics which 
Carnap shares with Bertrand Russellwhose influence upon Carnap and upon us all was greater than anyone elses
is his intellectual courage in changing his mind under the influence of criticism even on points of fundamental 
importance to his philosophy 

I had come to the Tyrol with the manuscript of a large book entitled Die beiden Grundprobleme der 
Erkenntnistheorie The Two Fundamental Problems of Epistemology It is still unpublished but an English 
translation may appear one day parts of it were later incorporated in a much abbreviated form in my Logik der 
Forschung The two problems were the problems of induction and of demarcationthe demarcation between 
science and metaphysics The book contained among much else a fairly detailed criticism of Wittgensteins 
and Carnaps doctrine of the elimination or overthrow Ueberwindung   of metaphysics through meaning
analysis I criticized this doctrine not from a metaphysical point of view but from the point of view of one who 
interested in science feared that this doctrine far from defeating the supposed enemy metaphysics in effect 
presented the enemy with the keys of the beleaguered city 

My criticism was directed largely against two books of Carnap Der logische Aufbau der Welt Aufbau for 
short and Scheinprobleme in der Philosophie and some of his articles in Erkenntnis Carnap 
accepted part of it  although he felt as it turned out  that I had exaggerated the differences 
between my views and those of the Vienna Circle of which he was a leading member 

 

 In  Carnap used the term Semantics as a synonym for logical syntax see Erkenntnis   p  
 See Carnap Ueberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache  The 
Overthrow of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language Erkenntnis   pp  
ff 
 See Carnaps generously appreciative report on certain of my views which were then still unpublished in 
Erkenntnis   pp  to  and my discussion of it in my Logic of Scientific Discovery LSc
D   originally published in German in  as Logik der Forschung but here always 
referred to as LScD note  to section  
 See Carnap review of my LScD in Erkenntnis   pp  especially  By his efforts to 
characterize his position clearly  Popper  is led to overemphasize the differences between his views and 
those    which are most closely allied to his     Popper is very close indeed to the point of view of the Vienna 
Circle In his presentation the differences appear much greater than they are in fact 

 

 

This silenced me for many years  especially as Carnap paid so much attention to my criticism in his Testability 
and Meaning But I felt all the time that the differences between our views were far from being imaginary and my 
feeling that they were important was much enhanced by Carnaps most recent papers and books on probability and 
induction 

The purpose of this paper is to discuss these differences so far as they concern the problem of 
demarcation It is with reluctance that I expose myself again to the charge of exaggerating differences But I hope 
that Professor Carnap wont be prevented from speaking his mind by an apprehension of silencing me for the rest of 
my days I promise to be more reasonable this time I have however accepted the invitation to write this paper and 
this leaves me no alternative but to try to characterize our differences as clearly and as sharply as possible In other 
words I must try to defend the thesis that these differences are realas real as I have felt them to be for the last  
years 

In Section  of this paper I try to give a brief outline of some of my own views which form the basis of my criticism In 
the later sections I try to trace the developmentas I see itof Carnaps views on the problem of the demarcation 
between science and metaphysics My approach throughout is critical rather than historical but I have aimed at 
historical accuracy if not at historical completeness 

 MY OWN VIEW OF THE PROBLEM 

It was in  that I first faced the problem of drawing a line of demarcation between those statements and 
systems of statements which could be properly described as belonging to empirical science and others which might 
perhaps be described as pseudoscientific or in certain contexts as metaphysical or which belonged perhaps to 
pure logic or to pure mathematics 

This is a problem which has agitated many philosophers since the time of Bacon although I have never found a very 
explicit formulation of it The most widely accepted view was that science was characterized by its observational 
basis or by its inductive method while pseudosciences and metaphysics were characterized by their 
speculative method or as Bacon said by the fact that they operated with mental anticipationssomething 
very similar to hypotheses 

This view I have never been able to accept The modern theories of physics especially Einsteins theory widely 
discussed in the year  were highly speculative and abstract and very far removed from what might be called 
their observational basis All attempts to show that they were more or less directly based on observations were 
unconvincing The same was true even of Newtons theory Bacon had raised objections against the Copernican 

 

 I published nothing even alluding to these differences of opinion during the first ten years after the publication of 
my LScD although I alluded to them in some lectures and next to nothing during the next ten years ie until 
I started on the present paperno more at any rate than a few critical remarks on Wittgenstein and Schlick in 
my Open Society first published in  see notes  L   and  to ch  see also chs   and  
of the present volume 

 

system on the ground that it needlessly did violence to our senses and in general the best physical theories always 
resembled what Bacon had dismissed as mental anticipations 

On the other hand many superstitious beliefs and many ruleofthumb procedures for planting etc to be found in 
popular almanacs and dream books have had much more to do with observations and have no doubt often been 
based on something like induction Astrologers more especially have always claimed that their science was based 
upon a great wealth of inductive material This claim is perhaps unfounded but I have never heard of any attempt to 
discredit astrology by a critical investigation of its alleged inductive material Nevertheless astrology was rejected by 
modern science because it did not fit accepted theories and methods 

Thus there clearly was a need for a different criterion of demarcation and I proposed though years elapsed before I 
published this proposal that the refutability or falsifiability of a theoretical system should be taken as the 
criterion of its demarcation According to this view which I still uphold a system is to be considered as scientific only 
if it makes assertions which may clash with observations and a system is in fact tested by attempts to produce such 
clashes that is to say by attempts to refute it Thus testability is the same as refutability and can therefore likewise 
be taken as a criterion of demarcation 

This is a view of science which takes its critical approach to be its most important characteristic Thus a scientist 
should look upon a theory from the point of view of whether it can be critically discussed whether it exposes itself to 
criticism of all kinds andif it doeswhether it is able to stand up to it Newtons theory for example predicted 
deviations from Keplers laws due to the interactions of the planets which had not been observed at the time It 
exposed itself thereby to attempted empirical refutations whose failure meant the success of the theory Einsteins 
theory was tested in a similar way And indeed all real tests are attempted refutations Only if a theory successfully 
withstands the pressure of these attempted refutations can we claim that it is confirmed or corroborated by 
experience 

There are moreover as I found later   degrees of testability some theories expose themselves to possible 
refutations more boldly than others For example a theory from which we can deduce precise numerical predictions 
about the splitting up of the spectral lines of light emitted by atoms in magnetic fields of varying strength will be more 
exposed to experimental refutation than one which merely predicts that a magnetic field influences the emission of 
light A theory which is more precise and more easily refutable than another will also be the more interesting one 
Since it is the more daring one it will be the one which is less probable But it is better testable for we can 
make our tests more precise and more severe And if it stands up to severe tests it will be better confirmed 
or better attested by these tests Thus confirmability or attestability or corroborability must increase 
with testability 

 

 See LScD sections  to  

 

 

 

This indicates that the criterion of demarcation cannot be an absolutely sharp one but will itself have degrees There 
will be welltestable theories hardly testable theories and nontestable theories Those which are nontestable are of 
no interest to empirical scientists They may be described as metaphysical 

Here I must again stress a point which has often been misunderstood Perhaps I can avoid these misunderstandings 
if I put my point now in this way Take a square to represent the class of all statements of a language in which we 
intend to formulate a science draw a broad horizontal line dividing it into an upper and lower half write science and 
testable into the upper half and metaphysics and nontestable into the lower then I hope you will realize that I do 
not propose to draw the line of demarcation in such a way that it coincides with the limits of a language leaving 
science inside and banning metaphysics by excluding it from the class of meaningful statements On the contrary 
beginning with my first publication on this subject  I stressed the fact that it would be inadequate to draw the line 
of demarcation between science and metaphysics so as to exclude metaphysics as nonsensical from a meaningful 
language 

I have indicated one of the reasons for this by saying that we must not try to draw the line too sharply This becomes 
clear if we remember that most of our scientific theories originate in myths The Copernican system for example was 
inspired by a NeoPlatonic worship of the light of the Sun who had to occupy the centre because of his nobility This 
indicates how myths may develop testable components They may in the course of discussion become fruitful and 
important for science In my Logic of Scientific Discovery  I gave several examples of myths which have 
become most important for science among them atomism and the corpuscular theory of light It would hardly 
contribute to clarity if we were to say that these theories are nonsensical gibberish in one stage of their development 
and then suddenly become good sense in another 

Another argument is the following It may happenand it turns out to be an important casethat a certain statement 
belongs to science since it is testable while its negation turns out not to be testable so that it must be placed 
below the line of demarcation This is indeed the case with the most important and most severely testable 
statementsthe universal of science I recommended in my Logic of Scientific Discovery that they should 
be expressed for certain purposes in a form like There does not exist any perpetual motion machine this is 
sometimes called Plancks formulation of the First Law of Thermodynamics that is to say in the form of a 
negation of an existential statement The corresponding existential statementThere exists a perpetual 
motion machinewould belong I suggested together with There exists a seaserpent to those below the line of 
demarcation as opposed to There is a seaserpent now on view in the British Museum which is well 

 

 See Ein Kriterion des empirischen Charakters theoretischer Systeme Erkenntnis   pp 
 ff now in LScD pp  see also LScD especially sections  and  
 LScD section  p  

 

 

above the line since it can easily be tested But we do not know how to test an isolated purely existential assertion 

I cannot in this place argue for the adequacy of the view that isolated purely existential statements should be classed 
as untestable and as falling outside the scientists range of interest  I only wish to make clear that if this view is 
accepted then it would be strange to call metaphysical statements meaningless  or to exclude them from our 
language For if we accept the negation of an existential statement as meaningful then we must accept the 
existential statement itself also as meaningful 

I have been forced to stress this point because my position has repeatedly been described as a proposal to take 
falsifiability or refutability as the criterion of meaning rather than of demarcation or as a proposal to exclude 
existential statements from our language or perhaps from the language of science Even Carnap who discusses my 
position in considerable detail and reports it correctly feels himself compelled to interpret it as a proposal to exclude 
metaphysical statements from some language or other  

But it is a fact that beginning with my first publication on this subject see note  above I always dismissed the 
problem of meaninglessness as a pseudoproblem and I was always opposed to the idea that it may be identified 
with the problem of demarcation This is my view still 

 CARNAPS FIRST THEORY OF MEANINGLESSNESS 

One of the theories which I had criticized in my manuscript and later more briefly in my Logic of Scientific 
Discovery was the assertion that metaphysics was meaningless and consisted of nonsensical 
pseudopropositions This theory  

 
 But one may perhaps find in Brouwers theories a suggestion that a universal statement could he meaningful 
while its existential negation was meaningless 
 See Testability and Meaning section  p  We may take Poppers principle of falsifiability as an 
example of the choice of this language viz of a language that excludes existential sentences as meaningless 
Carnap continues  Popper is however very cautious in the formulation of his    principle of demarcation he 
does not call the existential sentences meaningless but only nonempirical or metaphysical This second part of 
the quotation is perfectly correct and seems quite clear to me but Carnap continues Perhaps he  Popper  
wishes to exclude existential sentences and other metaphysical sentences not from the language altogether but 
only from the language of empirical science But why does Carnap assume that I should wish to exclude them 
from any language when I have repeatedly said the opposite 
 Carnap and the Vienna Circle attributed it to Wittgenstein but it is much older The Theory goes back to Hobbes 
at least and in the form described below as condition aasserting that words purporting to denote unobservable 
entities cannot have any meaningit was clearly and forcefully used by Berkeley and other nominalists See ch 
 also my reference to Hume LScD section  
 LScD section  I suppose that some people found it hard to accept the view that a pure or isolated 
existential statement There exists a seaserpent should be called metaphysical even though it might he 
deducible from a statement of an empirical character There is now a seaserpent on view in the entrance hall of 
the British Museum But they overlooked the fact that a in so far as it was so deducible it was no longer 
isolated but belonged to a testable theory and b if a statement is deducible from an empirical or a scientific 
statement then this fact need not make it empirical or scientific Any tautology is so deducible 

 

was supposed to bring about the overthrow of metaphysics and to destroy it more radically and more effectively 
than any earlier antimetaphysical philosophy But as I pointed out in my criticism the theory was based on a nave 
and naturalistic  view of the problem of meaningfulness moreover its propagators in their anxiety to oust 
metaphysics failed to notice that they were throwing all scientific theories on the same scrapheap as the 
meaningless metaphysical theories All this I suggested was a consequence of trying to destroy metaphysics 
instead of looking for a criterion of demarcationThe naturalistic theory as I called it of meaningfulness and 
meaninglessness in Carnap Aufbau which here followed Wittgenstein Tractatus was abandoned by 
Carnap long ago it has been replaced by the more sophisticated doctrine that a given 
expression is a meaningful sentence in a certain artificial language if and only if it complies 
with the rules of formation for wellformed formulae or sentences in that languageIn my opinion 
the development from the nave or naturalistic theory to the more sophisticated doctrine was a 
highly important and desirable one But its full significance has not been appreciated as far as I 
can see apparently it has not been noticed that it simply destroys the doctrine of the 
meaninglessness of metaphysicsIt is for this reason that I am now going to discuss this 
development in some detailBy the naturalistic theory of meaninglessness I mean the doctrine 
that every linguistic expression purporting to be an assertion is either meaningful or 
meaningless not by convention or as a result of rules which have been laid down by 
convention but as a matter of actual fact or due to its nature just as a plant is or is not green 
in fact or by nature and not by conventional rulesAccording to Wittgensteins famous 
verifiability criterion of meaning which Carnap accepted a sentencelike expression or a string 
of words was a meaningful sentence or proposition if and only if it satisfied the conditions a 
and bor a condition c which will be stated later 
a 
b 

all words which occurred in it had meaning and 
all words which occurred in it fitted together properly 

According to condition a of the theory which goes back to Hobbes and Berkeley a string of 
words was meaningless if any word in it was meaningless Wittgenstein formulated it in his 
Tractatus   italics mine The right method of philosophy is this when someone    wished 
to say something metaphysical to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to certain 
signs in his propositions According to Hobbes and Berkeley the only way in which a meaning 
was given to a word was by linking associating the word with certain observable experiences 
or phenomena Wittgenstein himself was 

 
 Although I called the theory naturalistic I now also call it absolutistic and essentialistic cp note  below for 
reasons which may perhaps emerge I do not propose to argue these reasons here for my criticism of the theory

not explicit on this point but Carnap was In his Aufbau he tried to show that all concepts used in the 
sciences could be defined on the basis of my own observational or perceptual experience He 
called such a definition of a concept its constitution and the resulting system of concepts a constitution 
system And he asserted that metaphysical concepts could not be constituted 

Condition b of the theory goes back to Bertrand Russell who suggested  that certain combinations of symbols 
which looked like propositions must be absolutely meaningless not simply false if certain paradoxes were to be 
avoided Russell did not mean to make a proposalthat we should consider these combinations as contrary to 
some partly conventional rules for forming sentences in order to avoid the paradoxes Rather he thought that 
he had discovered the fact that these apparently meaningful formulae expressed nothing and that they were in 
nature or in essence meaningless pseudopropositions A formula like a is an element of a or a is not an element of 
a looked like a proposition because it contained two subjects and a twotermed predicate but it was not a genuine 
proposition or sentence because a formula of the form x is an element of y could be a proposition only x was one 
typelevel lower than ya condition which obviously could not be satisfied if the same symbol a was to be 
substituted for both x and y 

This showed that a disregard of the typelevel of words or of the entities designated by them could make sentence
like expressions meaningless and according to Wittgenstein Tractatus and more explicitly Carnap Aufbau this 
confusion was a major source of metaphysical nonsense ie of the offering of pseudo
propositions for propositions It was called confusion of spheres in the Aufbau  it is the same 
kind of confusion which nowadays is often called a category mistake  According to the 
Aufbau for example my own experiences das Eigenpsychische physical bodies and the 
experiences of others das Fremdpsychische all belong to different spheres or types or 
categories and a confusion of these must lead to pseudopropositions and to pseudoproblems 
 Carnap describes the difference between physical and psychological entities as one between 
two types of order  subsisting within one kind or range of ultimate entities which leads him to 
a solution of the bodymind problem on the lines of neutral monism

and meaningless linguistic expressions covers only one side of this theory There is another side to the socalled 
verifiability criterion which may be formulated as the condition c 

c an alleged proposition or sentence is genuine if and only if it is a truth function of or reducible 
to elementary or atomic propositions expressing observations or perceptions 

In other words it is meaningful if and only if it is so related to some observation sentences that its truth follows from 
the truth of these observation sentences It is certain Carnap writes  that a string of words has meaning only if its 
derivability relations from protocolsentences observation sentences are given    that is to say if the way to its 
verification    is known  

The conditions a and b on the one hand and c on the other hand were asserted by Carnap to be equivalent  

A result of this theory was in Carnaps words  that the alleged sentences of metaphysics stand revealed by 
logical analysis as pseudosentences 

Carnaps theory of the intrinsic meaningfulness or meaninglessness of strings of words was soon to be modified but 
in order to prepare a basis for judging these modifications I must say a few words of criticism here  

First a word on c the verifiability criterion of meaning This criterion excludes from the realm of meaning all 
scientific theories or laws of nature for these are no more reducible to observation reports than socalled 
metaphysical pseudopropositions Thus the criterion of meaning leads to the wrong demarcation of 
science and metaphysics This criticism was accepted by Carnap in his Logical Syntax of Language  
and in his Testability and Meaning  but 

 
 See his paper on the Overthrow of Metaphysics Erkenntnis   pp  The Overthrowpaper 
belongs strictly speaking no longer to the period of the first theory of meaninglessness owing to its recognition 
of the fact that meaninglessness depends upon the language in question for Carnap writes p   
Meaningless in a precise sense is a string of words which within a certain given language does not form a 
sentence However the obvious consequences of this remark are not yet drawn and the theory is still asserted in 
an absolute sense our conditions a and b are formulated at the bottom of p  and c on p    as 
quoted

demand for verification is weakened

 See LScD especially sections      and  

 See the end of the first paragraph and the second paragraph on p  section  especially the following

even his latest theories are still open to it as I shall try to show in section  below 

Next we consider condition a of the doctrine the nominalistic view that only empirically definable words or signs 
have meaning 

Here the situation is even worse although it is very interesting 

For the sake of simplicity I begin my criticism with a very simple form of nominalism It is the doctrine that all non
logical or as I prefer to say nonformative words are nameseither such as Fido of a single physical object or as 
dog shared by several such objects Thus dog may be the name shared by the objects Fido Candy and Tiffin and 
so with all other words 

This view may be said to interpret the various words extensionally or enumeratively their meaning is given by 
a list or an enumeration of the things they name this thing here and that thing over there    We may call 
such an enumeration an enumerative definition of the meaning of a name and a language in which all nonlogical 
or nonformative words are supposed to be enumeratively defined may be called an enumerative language or a 
purely nominalistic language 

Now we can easily show that such a purely nominalistic language is completely inadequate for any scientific purpose 
This may be expressed by saying that all its sentences are analyticeither analytically true or contradictoryand that 
no synthetic sentences can be expressed in it Or if we prefer a formulation which avoids the terms analytic and 
synthetic which at present are under heavy fire from Professor Quines guns then we can put it in this way in a 
purely nominalistic language no sentence can be formulated whose truth or falsity could not be decided by merely 
comparing the defining lists or enumerations of the things which are mentioned in the sentence Thus the truth or 
falsity of any sentence is decided as soon as the words which occur in it have been given their meaning 

That this is so may be seen from our example Fido is a dog is true because Fido was one of the things enumerated 
by us in defining dog As opposed to this Chunky is a dog must be false simply because Chunky was not one of the 
things to which we pointed when drawing up our list defining dog Similarly if I give the meaning of white by listing 
 the paper on which I am now writing  my handkerchief  the cloud over there and  our snowman then the 
statement I have white hair will be false whatever the colour of my hair may be 

It is clear that in such a language hypotheses cannot be formulated It can not be a language of science And 

conversely every language adequate for science must contain words whose meaning is not given in an enumerative 
way Or as we may say every scientific language must make use of genuine universals ie of words whether 
defined or undefined with an indeterminate extension though perhaps with a reasonably definite intensional 
meaning For the intensional analysis of meaning see Carnap excellent book Meaning and Necessity 

Precisely the same criticism applies to more complicated languages espe 

 

 

cially to languages which introduce their concepts by the method of extensional abstraction used first by Frege and 
Russell provided the class of the fundamental elements upon which this method is based and the fundamental 
relations between these elements are supposed to be given extensionally by lists Now this was the case in Carnap 
Aufbau he operated with one primitive relation Er Experience of remembering which was assumed to be given 
in the form of a list of pairs  

All concepts belonging to his constitution system were supposed to be extensionally definable on the basis of this 
primitive relation Er ie of the list of pairs which gave a meaning to this relation Accordingly all statements which 
could be expressed in his language were true or false simply according to the extensional meaning of the words 
which occurred in them they were all either analytically true or contradictory  owing to the absence of genuine 
universal  words 

To conclude this section I turn to the condition b of the theory and to the doctrine of meaninglessness due to type 
mistakes or category mistakes This doctrine was derived as we have seen from Russells theory that an 
expression like a is an element of the class a must be meaninglessabsolutely or intrinsically or essentially as it 
were 

Now this doctrine has long since turned out to be mistaken Admittedly it is true that we can with Russell construct a 
language embodying a theory of types in which the expression in question is not a wellformed formula But we can 
also with Zermelo and his successors  Fraenkel Behmann von Neumann Bernays Lesniewski Quine 
Ackermann construct languages in which the expression in question is wellformed and thus meaningful and in 
some of them it is even a true statement for certain values of a 

These are of course wellknown facts But they completely destroy the idea of an inherently or naturally or 
essentially meaningless expression For the expression a is an element of the class a turns out to be meaningless 
in one language but meaningful in another and this establishes that a proof that an expression is meaningless in 
some languages must not be mistaken for a proof of intrinsic meaninglessness 

In order to prove intrinsic meaninglessness we should have to prove a great deal We should have to prove not 
merely that an alleged statement asserted or submitted by some writer or speaker is meaningless in all consistent 

 

 See especially Aufbau section  Carnap said there of his Theorem  which asserts the asymmetry of the 
primitive relation Er that it is an empirical theorem since its asymmetry can be read off the list of empirically 
given pairs But we must not forget that this is the same list of pairs which constituted or defined Er 
moreover a list of pairs which would lead to the negation of theorem  ie to the theorem that Er is 
symmetrical could not have been interpreted as an adequate list for Er as is particularly clear from sections  
to  
 This is the criticism of the Aufbau which I put to Feigl when we met first It was a meeting which for me proved 
momentous for it was Feigl who a year or two later arranged the vacation meeting in the Tyrol 
 The Difference Between Individual Concepts and Universal Concepts was discussed in the Aufbau section 
 it was criticized briefly in LScD sections  and  

 

 

languages but also that there cannot exist a meaningful sentence in any consistent language which would be 
recognized by the writer or speaker in question as an alternative formulation of what he intended to say And nobody 
has ever suggested how such a proof could possibly be given 

It is important to realize that a proof of intrinsic meaninglessness would have to be valid with respect to every 
consistent language and not merely with respect to every language that suffices for empirical science Few 
metaphysicians assert that metaphysical statements belong to the field of the empirical sciences and nobody would 
give up metaphysics because he is told that its statements cannot be formulated within these sciences or within 
some language suitable for these sciences After all Wittgensteins and Carnaps original thesis was that 
metaphysics is absolutely meaninglessthat it is sheer gibberish and nothing else that it is perhaps of the character 
of sighs or groans or tears or of surrealist poetry but not of articulate speech In order to show this it would be quite 
insufficient to produce a proof to the effect that it cannot be expressed in languages which suffice for the needs of 
science 

But even this insufficient proof has never been produced by anybody in spite of the many attempts to construct 
metaphysicsfree languages for science Some of these attempts will be discussed in the next two sections 

 CARNAP AND THE LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE 

Carnaps original overthrow of metaphysics was unsuccessful The naturalistic theory of meaninglessness turned out 
to be baseless and the total result was a doctrine which was just as destructive of science as it was of metaphysics 
In my opinion this was merely the consequence of an illadvised attempt to destroy metaphysics wholesale instead of 
trying to eliminate piecemeal as it were metaphysical elements from the various sciences whenever we can do this 
without endangering scientific progress by misplaced criticism such as had been directed by Bacon against 
Copernicus or by Duhem and Mach against atomism 

But the naturalistic theory of meaning was abandoned by Carnap a long time ago as I have said It has been 
replaced by the theory that whether a linguistic expression is wellformed or not depends on the rules of the language 
to which the expression is supposed to belong together with the theory that the rules of language are often not 
precise enough to decide the issue so that we have to introduce more precise rulesand with them an artificial 
language system 

I wish to repeat that I regard this as a very important development and as one that provides the key to a considerable 
number of interesting problems But it leaves the problem of demarcation between science and 
metaphysics exactly where it was This is my thesis 

To put it quite differently the nave or naturalistic or essentialistic theory of meaningfulness discussed in the previous 
section is mistaken and had to be 

 

 

replaced by a theory of wellformed formulae and with it of languages which are artificial in being subject to definite 
rules This important task has since been carried out by Carnap with great success But this reformation of the 
concept of meaningfulness completely destroys the doctrine of the meaninglessness of 
metaphysics And it leaves us without a hope of ever reconstructing this doctrine on the basis of the reformed 
concept of meaninglessness 

Unfortunately this seems to have been overlooked For Carnap and his circle  Neurath was especially influential 
tried to solve the problem by constructing a language of science a language in which every legitimate statement 
of science would be a wellformed formula while none of the metaphysical theories would be expressible in iteither 
because the terminology was not available or because there was no wellformed formula to express it 

I consider the task of constructing artificial model languages for a language of science an interesting one but I shall 
try to show that the attempt to combine this task with that of destroying metaphysics by rendering it meaningless 
has repeatedly led to disaster The antimetaphysical bias is a kind of philosophical or metaphysical prejudice which 
prevented the system builders from carrying out their work properly 

I shall try to show this briefly in this section for a the Physicalistic Language b the Language of Unified 
Science c the languages of the Logical Syntax and later in section  more fully for those proposed in 
Testability and Meaning 

a The Physicalistic Language Carnap Aufbau had sponsored what he called a methodological 
solipsismtaking ones own experiences as the basis upon which the concepts of science and thus the language 
of science have to be constructed By  Carnap had given this up under Neuraths influence and had adopted 
the thesis of physicalism according to which there was one unified language which spoke about physical things 
and their movements in space and time Everything was to be expressible in this language or translatable into it 
especially psychology in so far as it was scientific Psychology was to become radically behaviouristic every 
meaningful statement of psychology whether human or animal was to be translatable into a statement about the 
spatiotemporal movements of physical bodies 

The tendency underlying this programme is clear a statement about the human soul was to become as meaningless 
as a statement about God Now it may be fair enough to put statements about the soul and about God on the the 
same level But it seems questionable whether antimetaphysical and antitheological tendencies were much 
furthered by placing all our subjective experiences or rather all statements about them on the same level of 
meaninglessness as the statements of metaphysics Theologians or metaphysicians might be very pleased to learn 
that statements such as God exists or The Soul exists are on precisely the same level as I have conscious 

experiences or There exist feelingssuch as love or hatedistinguishable from the bodily movements which often 
though not always accompany them 

 

 

There is no need therefore to go into the merits or demerits of the behaviourist philosophy or the translatability 
thesis which in my opinion is nothing but materialist metaphysics in linguistic trappingsand I for one prefer to 
meet it without trappings we see that as an attempt to kill metaphysics this philosophy was not very effective As 
usual the broom of the antimetaphysicist sweeps away too much and also too little As a result we are left with an 
untidy and altogether untenable demarcation 

For an illustration of too much and too little I may perhaps cite the following passage from Carnap Psychology 
Within the Physical Language  Physics is altogether practically free from metaphysics thanks to the efforts of 
Mach Poincar and Einstein in psychology efforts to make it a science free from metaphysics have hardly begun 
Now free from metaphysics means here for Carnap reducible to protocolstatements But not even the simplest 
physical statements about the functioning of a potentiometerthe example is Carnaps  are so reducible Nor do I 
see any reason why we should not introduce mental states in our explanatory psychological theories if in physics old 
or new we are permitted to explain the properties of a conductor by the hypothesis of an electric fluid or of an 
electronic gas 

The point is that all physical theories say much more than we can test Whether this more belongs legitimately to 
physics or whether it should be eliminated from the theory as a metaphysical element is not always easy to say 
Carnaps reference to Mach Poincar and Einstein was unfortunate since Mach more especially looked forward to 
the final elimination of atomism which he with many other positivists considered to be a metaphysical element of 
physics He eliminated too much Poincar tried to interpret physical theories as implicit definitions a view which 
can hardly be more acceptable to Carnap and Einstein has for a long time been a believer in metaphysics operating 
freely with the concept of the physically real although no doubt he dislikes pretentious metaphysical verbiage as 
much as any of us a Most of the concepts with which physics works such as forces fields and even electrons and 
other particles are what Berkeley for example called qualitates occultae Carnap showed  that assuming 
conscious states in our psychological explanations was exactly analogous to assuming a forcea qualitas occulta
in order to explain the strength of a wooden post and he believed that such a view commits the fallacy of 
hypostasization  of which he suggested no physicist is guilty although it is often committed by psychologists  
But the fact is that we cannot explain the strength of the post by its structure alone as Carnap suggested   but only 
by its structure together with laws which make ample use of hidden forces which Carnap like Berkeley condemned 
as occult

Before concluding point a I wish to mention only briefly that this physicalism although from my point of view too 
physicalistic in most respects was not physicalistic enough in others For I do believe indeed that whenever we wish 
to put a scientific statement to an observational test this test must in a sense be physicalistic that is to say 
that we test our most abstract theories psychological as well as physical by deriving from them statements about the 
behaviour  of physical bodies 

I have called simple descriptive statements describing easily observable states of physical bodies basic 
statements and I asserted that in cases in which tests are needed it is these basic statements  which we try to 
compare with the facts and that we choose these statements and these facts because they are most easily 
comparable and intersubjectively most easily testable 

Thus according to my view we do not for the purpose of such basic tests choose reports which are difficult to test 
intersubjectively about our own observational experiences but rather reports which are easy to check about 
physical bodiesincluding potentiometerswhich we have observed 

The point is important because this theory of mine concerning the physicalist character of test statements is radically 
opposed to all those widely accepted theories which hold that we are constructing the external world of science out 
of our own experiences I have always believed that this is a prejudice it is still widely held and that quite properly 
we never trust our own experiences unless we are confident that they conform with intersubjectively testable views 

Now on this point Carnaps and Neuraths views were much less physicalistic at that time In fact they still upheld a 
form of Carnaps original methodological solipsism For they taught that the sentences which formed the empirical 
basis in my terminology of all tests and which they called protocolsentences should be reports about our own 
observational experiences although expressed in a physical language ie as reports about our own bodies In 
Otto Neuraths formulation such a protocolsentence was to have accordingly a very queer form He wrote  A 
complete protocolsentence might for example read Ottos protocol at   Ottos verbalized thinking was at  
In this room at  was a table observed by Otto 

 
 This behaviour however is always interpreted in the light of certain theories which creates a danger of 
circularity I cannot discuss the problem fully here but I may mention that the behaviour of men predicted by 
psychological theories nearly always consists not of purely physical movements but of physical movements 
which if interpreted in the light of theories are meaningful Thus if a psychologist predicts that a patient will 
have bad dreams he will feel that he was right whether the patient reports I dreamt badly last night or whether 
he reports I want to tell you that I have had a shocking dream though the two behaviours ie the movements 
of the lips may differ physically more widely than the movements corresponding to a negation may differ from 
those corresponding to an affirmation 
 The terms basic statement basic proposition or basic sentence Basissatz and empirical basis were 
introduced in LScD sections  and  to  they have often been used since by other authors in similar and 
in different senses See now also section i of the Addenda to the present volume 

 Erkenntnis   p  

 

 

One sees that the attempt is made here to incorporate the old starting pointthe observers own subjective 
experiences ie methodological solipsism 

Carnap later accepted my view but in the article On ProtocolSentences  in which he very kindly called this view 
of mine the most adequate of the forms of scientific language at present advocated    in the    theory of 
knowledge  he did not yet quite appreciate the fact appreciated clearly in Testability and Meaning as we 
shall see that the difference between my view and Neuraths concerned a fundamental point whether or not to 
appeal in our tests to simple observable physical facts or to our own senseexperiences methodological 
solipsism He therefore said in his otherwise admirable report of my views that the testing subject S will in practice 
often stop his tests when he has arrived at the observation statements of the protocolling subject S ie at 
statements of his own senseexperience whereas I held that he would stop only when he had arrived at a 
statement about some easily and intersubjectively observable behaviour of a physical body which at the 
moment did not appear to be problematic  

The point here mentioned is of course closely connected with the fact that I never believed in induction for which it 
seems natural to start from our own experiences but in a method of testing predictions deducible from our 
theories while Neurath believed in induction At that time I thought that when reporting my views Carnap had given 
up his belief in induction If so he has returned to it since 

b The Language of Unified Science Closely connected with physicalism was the view that the 
physicalist language was a universal language in which everything meaningful could be said The physicalist 
language is universal Carnap wrote  If because of its character as a universal language we adopt the 
language of physics as the    language of science then all science turns into physics Metaphysics is excluded 
as nonsensical  The various sciences become parts of the unified science 

It is clear that this thesis of the one universal language of the one unified science is closely connected 
with that of the elimination of metaphysics if it were possible to express everything that a nonmetaphysical scientist 
may wish to say in one language which by its rules makes it impossible to express metaphysical ideas then 
something like a prima facie case would have been made out in favour of the conjecture that metaphysics cannot 
be expressed in any reasonable language Of course the conjecture would be still very far from being established 

Now the queer thing about this thesis of the one universal language is that before it was ever published on the th 
of December  it had been

refuted by one of Carnaps colleagues in the Vienna Circle For Gdel by his two famous incompleteness theorems 
had proved that one unified language would not be sufficiently universal for even the purposes of elementary number 
theory although we may construct a language in which all assertions of this theory can be expressed no such 
language suffices for formalizing all the proofs of those assertions which in some other language can be proved 

It would have been best therefore to scrap forthwith this doctrine of the one universal language of the one universal 
science especially in view of Gdels second theorem which showed that it was pointless to try to discuss the 
consistency of a language in that language itself But more has happened since to establish the impossibility of the 
thesis of the universal language I have in mind especially Tarskis proof that every universal language is 
paradoxical first published in  in Polish and in  in German But in spite of all this the doctrine has survived 
at least I have nowhere seen a recantation  And the socalled International Encyclopedia of Unified Science 
which was founded upon his doctrine despite my opposition  at the First Congress for Scientific Philosophy in 
Paris  is still being continued It will remain a monument to a metaphysical doctrine once passionately held by 
Neurath and brilliantly wielded by him as a major weapon in the antimetaphysical crusade 

For no doubt the strong philosophical belief which inspired this forceful and lovable person was by his own 
standards purely metaphysical A unified science in a unified language is really nonsense I am sorry to say and 
demonstrably so since it has been proved by Tarski that no consistent language of this kind can exist Its logic is 
outside it Why should not its metaphysics be outside it too 

 
 The doctrine is still maintained in all essentials although in a more cautious mood in Testability and 
Meaning and not touched upon in the corrections and additions added to various passages in  see below 
note  and text In an excellent and by now famous paragraph of his Introduction to Semantics section 
 Carnap indicated how the views exhibited in his earlier book The Logical Syntax of Language have 
to be modified as a result chiefly of the new point of view of semantics But the Syntax although it continued 
to subscribe to the doctrine of the unified science in a unified language see especially section  the bottom of 
p  and pp  ff did not investigate this doctrine more fully which may perhaps be the reason why Carnap 
overlooked the need to modify this doctrine 

 In Paris I opposed the foundation of the Encyclopedia  Neurath used to call me the official opposition of the 
Circle although I was never so fortunate as to belong to it I pointed out among other things that it would have 
no similarity whatever to an encyclopedia as Neurath conceived it and that it would turn out to be another series 
of Erkenntnis articles For Neuraths ideal of an encyclopedia see for example his critical article on LScD 
Erkenntnis  pp  to  especially section  At the Copenhagen Congress in  which Carnap did 
not attend I tried to show that the doctrine of the unity of science and of the one universal language was 
incompatible with Tarskis theory of truth Neurath thereupon suggested in the discussion which followed my 
lecture that Tarskis theories about the concept of truth must be untenable and he inspired if my memory does 
not deceive me Arne Ness who was also present to undertake an empirical study of the usages of the word 
truth in the hope of thus refuting Tarski See also Carnaps appropriate remark on Ness in the Introduction to 
Semantics p  

 

 

I do not of course suggest that Carnap did not know all this but I suggest that he did not see its devastating effect 
upon the doctrine of the unified science in the unified language 

It may be objected perhaps that I am taking the doctrine of the unified language too seriously and that a strictly 
formalized science was not intended  Neurath for example used to speak especially in his later publications of a 
universal slang which indicates that he did not think of a formalized universal language I believe that this is true 
But this view again destroys the doctrine of the meaninglessness of metaphysics For if there are no 
strict rules of formation for the universal slang then the assertion that we cannot express metaphysical 
statements in it is gratuitous and it can only lead us back to the nave naturalistic view of meaninglessness criticized 
above in section  

It may be mentioned in this context that Gdels and Churchs discoveries also sealed the fate of another of the pet 
doctrines of positivism and of one of my pet aversions   I have in mind Wittgensteins The riddle does not exist 
If a question can be put at all it can also be answered  

This doctrine of Wittgensteins called by Carnap in the Aufbau  the proud thesis of the omnipotence of rational 
science was hardly tenable even when it first appeared if we remember Brouwers ideas published long before the 
Tractatus was written With Gdel especially with his second theorem of undecidability and Church its situation 
became even worse for from them we learned that we could never complete even our methods of solving 
problems Thus a wellformed mathematical question may become meaningless if we adopt a criterion of meaning 
according to which the meaning of a statement lies in the method by which it can be verified in mathematics proved 
or disproved This shows that we may be able to formulate a question and similarly the possible answers to it 
without an inkling as to how we might find out which of the possible answers is true which demonstrates the 
superficiality of Wittgensteins proud thesis 

Carnap was the first philosopher who recognized the immense importance of Gdels discoveries and he did his best 
to make them known to the philosophical world It is the more surprising that Gdels result did not produce that 
change which it should have produced in the Vienna Circles tenets in my opinion undoubtedly and obviously 
metaphysical tenets all too tenaciously held concerning the language and the scope of science 

 
 Another is  of the Tractatus see also  Hence there can never be surprises in logic which is 
either trivial viz if logic is confined to the twovalued propositional calculus or obviously mistaken and most 
misleading in view of  Mathematics is a method of logic I think that nearly every mathematical proof is 
surprising By God this is impossible Hobbes said when first encountering Euclids derivation of the 
Pythagorean theorem 
 Tractatus  We also read there For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be 
expressed But the question may be Is this assertion for example Goldbachs conjecture demonstrable And 
the true answer may be We dont know perhaps we may never know and perhaps we can never know

c Carnap Logical Syntax is one of the few philosophical books which can be described as of really firstrate 
importance Admittedly some of its arguments and doctrines are superseded owing mainly to Tarskis discoveries 
as Carnap himself explained frankly in that famous last paragraph of his Introduction to Semantics Admittedly 
the book is not easy to read and even more difficult in English than in German But it is my firm conviction that if 
ever a history of the rational philosophy of the earlier half of this century should be written this book ought to have a 
place in it second to none I cannot even try here wedged between critical analyses to do justice to it But one point 
at least I must mention It was through this book that the philosophical world to the west of Poland was first 
introduced to the method of analysing languages in a metalanguage and of constructing objectlanguagesa 
method whose significance for logic and the foundations of mathematics cannot be overrated and it was in this book 
that the claim was first made and I believe completely substantiated that this method was of the greatest 
importance for the philosophy of science If I may speak personally the book which came out a few months before 
my Logic of Scientific Discovery and which I read while my book was in the press marks the beginning of a 
revolution in my own philosophical thinking although I did not understand it fully because of its real internal 
difficulties I believe before I had read Tarskis great paper on the Concept of Truth in the German translation 
 Then I realized of course that a syntactic metalinguistic analysis was inadequate and must be replaced by 
what Tarski called semantics 

Of course I believe that from the point of view of the problem of demarcation a great step forward was made in the 
Syntax I say of course since I am alluding to the fact that some of my criticism was accepted in this book Part of 
the relevant passage is quoted above in note  But what is most interesting from our present point of view is the 
passage immediately following the quotation it shows I believe that Carnap did not accept enough of my criticism 
The view here presented he writes  allows great freedom in the introduction of new primitive concepts and new 
primitive sentences in the language of physics or of science in general yet at the same time it retains the possibility 
of differentiating pseudoconcepts and pseudosentences from real scientific concepts and sentences 
and thus of eliminating the former Here we find again the old thesis of the meaninglessness of metaphysics 
But it is mitigated if only a little by the immediate continuation of this passage which Carnap places in square 
brackets and which shows the influence of my criticism mentioned by him on the preceding page This elimination 
however is not so simple as it appeared on the basis of the earlier position of the Vienna Circle which was in 
essentials that of Wittgenstein On that view it was a question of the language in an absolute sense it was thought 
possible to reject both concepts and sentences if they did not fit into the language 

 

 Syntax section  p  top The italics are Carnaps 

 

 

The position indicated by these passages including the one quoted briefly in note  above may be described as 
follows 
 

Some difficulties especially those of Wittgensteins verifiability criterion of meaning are recognized also the 
inadequacy of what I have called the naturalistic theory of meaningfulness which corresponds to the belief in 
the language in which things simply are or are not essentially meaningful by their nature 
But the belief is still maintained that we can by some feat of ingenuity establish one language which does the 
trick of rendering meaningless precisely the metaphysical concepts and sentences and no others 
Even the belief that we can construct one universal language of unified science is still upheld in consequence 
of  but it is not stressed and not examined in detail See point b in this section above and especially the 
passage from the Syntax section  p  mentioned in note  above 

 

 

This situation does not call for further criticism on my part practically all that needs to be said I have said already 
especially that this approach renders Tarskis Semantics meaningless and with it most of the theory of logical 
inference ie of logic Only one furtherand I believe importantcomment has to be made 

One of the difficulties of this great and important book of Carnaps lies in its emphasis upon the fact that the syntax of 
a language can be formulated in that language itself The difficulty is the greater because the reader has hardly 
learnt to distinguish between an objectlanguage and a metalanguage when he is told that after all the distinction is 
not quite as radical as he supposed it to be since the metalanguage it is now emphasized may form part of the 
objectlanguage 

Carnaps emphasis is undoubtedly misplaced It is a fact that part of the metalanguage viz its syntax can form 
part of the objectlanguage But although this fact is very important as we know from Gdels work its main use is in 
the construction of selfreferring sentences which is a highly specialized problem From the point of view of 
promoting the understanding of the relation between objectlanguage and metalanguage it would no doubt have 
been wiser to treat the metalanguage as distinct from the objectlanguage It could of course have still been shown 
that at least a part of the metalanguage and enough for Gdels purposesmay be expressed in the object
language without stressing the mistaken thesis that the whole of the metalanguage can be so expressed 

Now there is little doubt that it was the doctrine of the one universal language in which the one unified science was to 
be expressed that led Carnap to this emphasis which contributes so much to the difficulties of his book for he hoped 
to construct a unified language which would automatically eliminate metaphysics It is a great pity to find this excellent 
book spoiled by an antimetaphysical dogmaand by a wrong demarcation which eliminates together with 
metaphysics the most important parts of logic 

The Syntax continues the doctrine of the meaninglessness of metaphysics 

 

in the following form All meaningful sentences either belong to the language of science or if philosophical they 
can be expressed within the syntax of that language This syntax comprises the whole of the philosophy and logic of 
science so far as these are translatable into the formal mode of speech moreover this syntax can if we wish be 
formulated in the same universal object language in which all the sciences may be formulated 

Here it is not only the doctrine of the one universal language which I cannot accept I also cannot accept the ruling 
that what I say must be translatable into the formal mode of speech in order to be meaningful or to be understood 
by Carnap No doubt one should express oneself as clearly as possible and no doubt what Carnap calls the formal 
mode of speech is often preferable to what he calls the material mode and I have often used it in my Logic of 
Scientific Discovery and before without having been told to do so But it is not necessarily preferable And why 
should it necessarily be preferable Perhaps because the essence of philosophy is language analysis But I am not 
a believer in essences Nor in Wittgenstein How to make oneself better understood can only be a matter of thought 
and experience 

And why should all philosophy be linguistic analysis No doubt it may often help to put a question in terms of 
languageconstruction But why should all philosophical questions be of this kind Or is this the one and only non
linguistic thesis of philosophy 

The positivist attack has put if I may say so the fear of God into all of us who wish to speak sense We have all 
become more careful in what we say and how we say it and this is all to the good But let us be clear that the 
philosophical thesis that language analysis is everything in philosophy is paradoxical I admit that 
this criticism of mine no longer applies in this form to Testability and Meaning which replaces the thesis by a 
proposal that is no longer paradoxical no reasons however are offered in favour of the proposal except that it is 
an improved version of the thesis and this is no reason it seems to me for accepting it 

 TESTABILITY AND MEANING 

Carna Testability and Meaning is perhaps the most interesting and important of all the papers in the field of the 
philosophy of the empirical sciences which were written in the period between Wittgenstein Tractatus and the 
German translation of Tarskis essay on the concept of truth It was written in a period of crisis and marks great 
changes in the authors views At the same time its claims are very modest The object of this essay is not to 
offer    solutions    It aims rather to stimulate further investigations This aim was amply realized the 
investigations which sprang from it must number hundreds 

Replacing verifiability by testability or by confirmability Testability and Meaning is as its title indicates very 
largely a treatise on our central problem It still attempts to exclude metaphysics from the language of science 

 

 

 

   an attempt will be made to formulate the principle of empiricism in a more exact way by stating a requirement of 
confirmability or testability as a criterion of meaning we read in section  and in section  p   this hint is 
elaborated As empiricists we require the language of science to be restricted in a certain way we require that 
descriptive predicates and hence synthetic sentences are not to be admitted unless they have some connection with 
possible observations    What is not to be admitted is of course metaphysics    even if L were to be a 
language adequate for all science    we should not wish for example to have in L    sentences corresponding 
to many or perhaps most of the sentences occurring in the books of metaphysicians  

Thus the main ideaexcluding metaphysics from the wellformed formulae of L the language of scienceis 
unchanged Unchanged too is the idea of the one language of science although Carnap now says very clearly 
that we can choose our language and that various scientists can choose it in different ways he proposes that we 
accept a universal language and he even defends the thesis of physicalism in a modified form He often speaks 
as in the passages quoted of the language of science or of the possibility of having a language for all science or 
of the whole or the total language of science  the impossibility of such a language he still does not realize 

Carnap is however very careful in the formulation of his new ideas He says that we have a choice between many 
languages of science and he says that the principle of empiricismwhich turns out to be another name for the 
principle of the meaninglessness of metaphysicsshould preferably be formulated not as an assertion but as a 
proposal or requirement  for selecting a language of science 

One might think that with this formulation the idea of excluding metaphysics as meaningless has in fact been 
abandoned for the metaphysician need not and clearly would not accept any such proposal he would simply make 
another proposal in its place according to which metaphysics would become meaningful in an appropriate language 
But this is not how Carnap sees the situation He sees it rather as the task or duty imposed upon the anti
metaphysician to justify his view of the meaninglessness of metaphysics by constructing a 
language of science free from metaphysics And this is how the problem is still seen by many I fear 

It is easy to show using my old arguments that no such language can be constructed 

My thesis is that a satisfactory language for science would have to contain with any wellformed formula its 
negation and since it has to contain universal sentences it has therefore to contain existential sentences also 

But this means that it must contain sentences which Carnap Neurath and all other antimetaphysicians always 
considered to be metaphysical In order 

 
 Testability section  p  
 See Testability sections  p  f and  p   p  as quoted and  pp   
 Section  p   

 

 

to make this quite clear I choose as an extreme example what may be called the archmetaphysical 
assertion  There exists an omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient personal spirit I shall briefly show how this 
sentence can be constructed as a wellformed or meaningful sentence in a physicalistic language which is quite 
similar to those proposed in Testability and MeaningWe can take as primitive the following four physicalistic 
predicates 
 

The thing a occupies a position b or more precisely a occupies a position of which the point or region b is a 
part in symbols Posab   
The thing machine or body or person    a can put the thing b into position c in symbols Putabc  
a makes the utterance b in symbols Uttab 
a is asked ie adequately stimulated by an utterance combined say with a truth drug whether or not b in 
symbols Askab 

We assume that in our language we have at our disposal names of all expressions of the form Posab Puta
bc etc including some of those introduced below with their help I shall use for simplicitys sake quotation 
names I am aware however of the fact that this procedure is not exact especially where variables in quotes are 
bound as in  but this difficulty can be overcomeNow we can easily introduce with the help of explicit definitions 
using  and   

 
 
 

a is omnipresent or Oposa 
a is omnipotent or Oputa 

 
 One need not believe in the scientific character of psychoanalysis which I think is in a metaphysical phase in 
order to diagnose the antimetaphysical fervour of positivism as a form of Fatherkilling 
 Posab is used for the sake of simplicity we should really operate with position and momentum or with the 
state of a The necessary amendments are trivial I may remark that I do not presuppose that the variables a 
b etc all belong to the same type or semantical category 
 Or as Carnap would put it a is able to make the full sentence Posbc true see Carnaps explanation of his 
primitive realizable a term of the metalanguage however in contradistinction to my Put in Testability 
section  p  Explanation  
 The definitions are  Oposa  bPosab Oputa  bcPutabcNext we have the Bilateral 
reduction sentence  Askab cid

Moreover with the help of  and  we can introduce by Carnaps reduction method 
a thinks b or Thab 

Carnap recommends  that such a predicate should be admitted With the help of  we can now define 
explicitly 

a is a thinking person or Thpa 
a is a personal spirit or Spa 
a knows that b is in position c or Knposabc 
a knows that b can put c into the position d or Knputabcd 
a knows that b thinks c or Knthabc 
a is unfathomable or Unkna 
a knows the fact b or Knab 
a is truthful or  Veraxa 
a is omniscient or Okna 

Nothing is now easier than to give an existential formula expressing the archmetaphysical assertion that a 
thinking person a exists positioned everywhere able to put anything anywhere thinking all and only what is in fact 
true and with nobody else knowing all about as thinking The uniqueness of an a of this kind is demonstrable from 
as properties We cannot however identify a with the God of Christianity There is a difficulty in defining morally 
good on a physicalistic basis But questions of definability are anyway in my opinion supremely uninteresting
outside mathematicsexcept to essentialists see below 

It is clear that our purely existential archmetaphysical formula cannot be submitted to any scientific test there is no 
hope whatever of falsifying itof finding out if it is false that it is false For this reason I describe it as metaphysical
as falling outside the province of science 

But I do not think Carnap is entitled to say that it falls outside science or outside the language of science or that it is 
meaningless Its meaning seems to me perfectly clear also the fact that some logical analysts must have mistaken 
its empirical incredibility for meaninglessness But one could even conceive of experiments which might confirm it in 
Carnaps sense that is to say weakly verify it see text to note  It helps us very little if we are told in 
Testability  that the meaning of a sentence is in a certain sense identical with the way we determine its truth and 
falsehood and a sentence has meaning only if such a determination is possible One thing emerges clearly from this 
passagethat it is not Carnaps intention to allow meaning to a formula like the archmetaphysical one But the 
intention is not realized it is not realized I think because it is not realizable 

I need hardly say that my only interest in constructing our archmetaphysical existential formula is to show that there 
is no connection between wellformedness and scientific character The problem of how to construct a 
language of science which includes all we wish to say in science but excludes 

 
 Testability section  p  S  

 Testability section  end of first paragraph 

 

 

those sentences which have always been considered as metaphysical is a hopeless one It is a 
typical pseudoproblem And nobody has ever explained why it should be interesting to solve it if it is 
soluble Perhaps in order to be able to say as before that metaphysics is meaningless But this would not mean 
anything like what it meant before a 

But it may be said it may still be possible to realize at least part of the old Wittgensteinian dream and to make 
metaphysics meaningless For perhaps Carnap was simply too generous in allowing us to use dispositional 
predicates such as a is able to put b into c and a thinks b the latter characterized as a disposition to utter b I 
cannot hold out any hope to those who pursue this line of thought As I tried to show when discussing the Aufbau in 
section  we need in science genuine nonextensional universals But in my Logic of Scientific 
Discovery I indicated brieflymuch too briefly for I thought that the reductionist  ideas of the Aufbau had been 
given up by its authorthat all universals are dispositional not only a predicate like soluble but also 
dissolving or dissolved 

If I may quote from my Logic of Scientific Discovery LScD for short 

Every descriptive statement uses    universals every statement has the character of a theory of a hypothesis The 
statement Here is a glass of 

 
a Added in Proofs 

The reaction of my positivist friends to my archmetaphysical formula I have not yet seen Carnaps reaction but 
I received a report from BarHillel was this As this formula is wellformed it is meaningful and also scientific of 
course not scientifically or empirically true but rather scientifically or empirically false or more precisely 
disconfirmed by experience Some of my positivist friends also denied that my name archmetaphysical had any 
historical justification and asserted that the antimetaphysical tendencies of the Vienna Circle never had anything 
to do with antitheological tendencies and this in spite of Neuraths physicalism which was intended as a modern 
version of either classical or dialectical materialism 

Now should anyone go so far as to commit himself to the admission that my archmetaphysical formula is well
formed and therefore empirically true or false then I think he will encounter difficulties in extricating himself from 
this situation For how could anybody defend the view that my archmetaphysical formula is false or 
disconfirmed It is certainly unfalsifiable and nondisconfirmable In fact it is expressible in the form 

Ex Gx 

in words there exists something that has the properties of God And on the assumption that Gx is an 
empirical predicate we can prove that its probability must equal  See Carnap Logical Foundations of 
Probability p  I can prove further that this means that its probability cannot be diminished by any 

empirical information that is by any information whose logical probability differs from zero But this means 
according to Carnap Logical Foundations that its degree of confirmation equals  and that it cannot be 
disconfirmedas I asserted above 

How then can my positivist friends assert that the empirical statement Ex Gx is false It is at any rate 
better confirmed than any scientific theory 

My own view is that it is nontestable and therefore nonempirical and nonscientific 

 The term reductionism is it seems Quines It corresponds closely to my term inductivism See for example 
Carnap report in Erkenntnis   pp  See also my remarks in LScD section  p  where in 
criticism of what Quine calls reductionism I wrote The older positivists accepted as scientific only such concepts 
or terms as    could be reduced to elementary experiences sensedata impressions perceptions 
experiences of remembrance  Carnaps term in the Aufbau  etc See also LScD section  especially 
notes  and  and text 

 

 

water cannot be verified by any observational experience The reason is that the universals which occur in it 
cannot be correlated with any particular observational experience    By the word glass for example we denote 
physical bodies which exhibit a certain lawlike behaviour and the same applies to the word water 
Universals    cannot be constituteda That is they cannot be defined in the manner of the Aufbau 

What then is the answer to the problem of defining or introducing a dispositional term like soluble The answer is 
simply that the problem is insoluble And there is no need whatever to regret this fact 

It is insoluble for assume we have succeeded in reducingx is soluble in water by what Carnap calls a reduction
sentence describing an operational test such as if x is put into water then x is soluble in water if and only if it 
dissolves What have we gained We have still to reduce water and dissolves and it is clear that among the 
operational tests which characterize water we should have to include if anything that is soluble in water is put into 
x then if x is water that thing dissolves In other words not only are we forced in introducing soluble to fall back 
upon water which is dispositional in perhaps even a higher degree but in addition we are forced into circularity for 
we introduce soluble with the help of a term water which in its turn cannot be operationally introduced without 
soluble and so on ad infinitum 

The situation with x is dissolving or x has dissolved is very similar We say that x has dissolved rather than that it 
has disappeared only if we expect to be able to show say by evaporating the water that certain traces of this 
process can be found and that we can if necessary even identify parts of the dissolved and later reclaimed 
substance with parts of x by tests which will have to establish among other things the fact that the reclaimed 
substance is again soluble 

There is a very good reason why this circle cannot be broken by establishing a definite order of reduction or 
introduction It is this our actual tests are never conclusive and always tentative We never should agree to a ruling 
telling us to stop our tests at any particular pointsay when arriving at primitive predicates All predicates are for the 

scientist equally dispositional ie open to doubt and to tests This is one of the main ideas of the theory of the 
empirical basis in my LScD  

 
 The passage is from LScD end of section  see also sections  and  Although this passage together 
with Carnaps related passage about the term soluble  Testability section  p  may perhaps have 
contributed to starting the socalled problem of counterfactual conditionals I have never been able in 
spite of strenuous efforts to understand this problem or more precisely what remains of it when one does not 
subscribe either to essentialism or to phenomenalism or to meaninganalysis 

 In Testability Carnap accepts most of my theory of the empirical basis  LScD sections  to  including 
most of my terminology empirical basis basic sentences etc cp also his introduction and use of the term 
observable with LScD section  p  Even the slight but significant discrepancy which I have here 
interpretedsee text to notes  to  aboveas a survival from his days of methodological solipsism and which 
I criticized in LScD note  and text to note  to section  is now rectified  Testability section  see 
especially Decision  p  and text to note  p  Some other points of agreement apart from those to 
which Carnap himself refers are the thesis that there is a conventional component in the acceptance or 
rejection of any synthetic sentence cp Testability section  p  with my LScD section  p  
and the rejection of the doctrine of atomic sentences which state ultimate facts cp Testability section  p 
 with my LScD section  p  Yet in spite of this farreaching agreement a decisive difference 
remains I stress a negative view of testability which for me is the same as refutability and I accept 
confirmations only if they are the outcome of unsuccessful but genuine attempts at refutation For Carnap 
testability and refutability remain weakened forms of verification The consequences of this difference will 
become clear in my discussion of probability and induction in section  below 

 

 

So much about the fact that soluble cannot be reduced to something that is less dispositional As to my contention 
that there is no need to regret this fact I want only to say again that outside mathematics and logic problems of 
definability are mostly gratuitous We need many undefined terms  whose meaning is only precariously fixed by 
usageby the manner in which they are used in the context of theories and by the procedures and practices of the 
laboratory Thus the meaning of these concepts will be changeable But this is so with all concepts including defined 
ones since a definition can only reduce the meaning of the defined term to that of undefined terms 

What then is behind the demand for definitions An old tradition reaching back far beyond Locke to Aristotelian 
essentialism and as a result of it a belief that if a man was unable to explain what a word meant which he used 
then this showed that he had given no meaning to it  Wittgenstein and had therefore been talking nonsense But 
this Wittgensteinian belief is nonsense since all definitions must ultimately go back to undefined terms However 
since I have discussed all this elsewhere  I shall say nothing further about it here 

In concluding this section I wish to stress again the point that testability and confirmability even if satisfactorily 
analysed are in no way better fitted to serve as criteria of meaning than the older criterion of verifiability But I 
must say that in addition I am unable to accept Carnaps analysis of either test testable etc or of confirmation 
The reason is again that his terms are substitutes for verification verifiable etc slightly weakened so as to 

escape the objection that laws are not verifiable But this compromise is inadequate as we shall see in the next and 
last section of this paper Acceptability in science depends not upon anything like a truthsurrogate 
but upon the severity of tests  

 
 In Testability section  p  Carnap hopes that we may introduce all terms on the basis of one undefined 
onetermed predicate either bright or alternatively solid But one cannot introduce any other term on this basis 
with the help of a reduction pair at least two different given predicates are needed even for one bilateral 
reduction sentence Moreover we need at least one twotermed relation 

 See for example my Open Society ch  section ii 
 As a consequence the following contentcondition or entailment condition is invalid If x entails y ie if the 
content of y is part of that of x then y must be at least as well confirmed as x the invalidity of the content 
condition was pointed out in my LScD sections of  and  cp sections  f where content is identified 
with degree of testability and  absolute  logical improbability and where it was shown that the invalidity of the 
content condition destroys the identification of degree of confirmation with logical probability In Testability 
however Carnaps whole theory of reduction rests upon this condition Cp paragraph  of section  p  and 
Definition Ia on p  In Probability p  cp p  Carnap notes the invalidity of the entailment 
condition or consequence condition but he does not draw from it the I believe necessary conclusion that 
degree of confirmation cannot coincide with probability I have reaffirmed this conclusion in appendix IX to L
ScD Cp notes  and  f below and text 

 

 

 PROBABILITY AND INDUCTION 

The full consequences of approaching confirmation as if it was a kind of weakened verification become manifest only 
in Carnaps two books on probabilitythe big volume entitled Logical Foundations of Probability referred to 
here as Probability and the smaller progressreport The Continuum of Inductive Methods referred to 
here as Methods  

The topics of these two books are very closely related to our problem They deal with the theory of induction and 
induction has always been one of the most popular criteria of demarcation for science for the empirical sciences are 
as a rule considered to be characterized by their methods and these in turn are usually characterized as 
inductive  

This is Carnaps view too his new criterion of demarcation is as we have seen confirmability And in these two 
books Carnap explains that the methods of confirming a sentence are identical with the inductive method Thus 
we must conclude that the criterion of demarcation now becomes more precisely confirmability by inductive 
methods In other words a linguistic expression will belong to the empirical sciences if and only if it is logically 
possible to confirm it by inductive methods or by inductive evidence 

As I have indicated in section  this criterion of demarcation does not 

 

 There is very little of relevance to the particular problem of demarcation in two of the three books published 
between Syntax and ProbabilityIntroduction to Semantics and Meaning and Necessity and 
nothing so far as I can see in Formalization of Logic which comes between them In the Introduction I 
only find a what I take to be an allusion to Neuraths opposition to Tarskis concept of truth  Carnap gives an 
excellent and tolerant reply to it pp vii f and b a just dismissal of the relevance of Arne Ness questionnaire 
method p   see also my note  and text above In Meaning and Necessity which I for one believe to 
be the best of Carnaps books it is also perhaps the one which has been most fiercely attacked there are a few 
remarks on ontology and metaphysics p   which together with a reference to Wittgenstein p  f appear to 
indicate that Carnap still believes in the meaninglessness of metaphysics for this reference reads    to know 
the meaning of a sentence is to know in which of the possible cases it would be true and in which not as 
Wittgenstein has pointed out This passage however seems to me to be in conflict with Carnaps main 
conclusions which I find convincing For the cited passage outlines it is clear what Carnap calls an 
extensional approach as opposed to an intensional approach to meaning on the other hand the main 
conclusions    are that we must distinguish between understanding the meaning of a given expression and 
investigating whether and how it applies p  italics mine and meaning is explained with the help of 
intension application with the help of extension Relevant to our problem is also Carnaps explication of 
his concept explication p  f see below 
 Our problem of demarcation is not explicitly discussed in these two books except for a remark in Probability p 
 on the principle of empiricism also mentioned on pp  and  and a discussion of the empirical 
character of the principle of uniformity of nature pp  ff Both passages will be mentioned below 

 

 

satisfy my requirements all sorts of pseudosciences such as astrology are clearly not excluded The answer to this 
would be no doubt that the criterion is not intended to exclude what I call pseudosciences and that these consist 
simply of false sentences or perhaps of disconfirmed sentences rather than of metaphysical nonconfirmable 
ones I am not satisfied by this answer believing as I do that I have a criterion which excludes for example astrology 
and which has proved extremely fruitful in connection with a host of problems but I am prepared to accept it for 
arguments sake and to confine myself to showing as before that the criterion produces the wrong 
demarcation 

My criticism of the verifiability criterion has always been this against the intention of its defenders it did not 
exclude obvious metaphysical statements but it did exclude the most important and interesting 
of all scientific statements that is to say the scientific theories the universal laws of nature Now let us see 
how these two groups of statements fare under the new criterion 

As to the first it turns out that my archmetaphysical existential formula obtains in Carnaps system a high 
confirmation value for it belongs to the almosttautological almost Ltrue sentences whose confirmation value is  
or in a finite world of sufficient size indistinguishable from  Moreover it is a kind of statement for which even 
experimental confirmation is conceivable  although no tests in my sense there is no conceivable way of 
refuting it Its lack of refutability puts it into the class of metaphysical sentences by mry criterion of demarcation Its 
high confirmation value in Carnaps sense on the other hand should make it vastly superior to and more scientific 
than any scientific law 

For all universal laws have zero confirmation according to Carnaps theory in a world which is in any sense 
infinite temporal infinity suffices as Carnap himself has shown  and even in a finite world their value would be 
indistinguishable from zero if the number of events or things in this world is sufficiently large All this is an obvious 
consequence of the fact that confirmability and confirmation in Carnaps sense are just slightly weakened versions 
of verifiability and verification The reason why the universal laws are not verifiable is thus identical with the reason 
why they are not confirmable they assert a great deal about the worldmore than we can ever hope either to verify 
or to confirm 

In face of the fact that natural laws turn out to be nonconfirmable 

 
 There may conceivably be seers like Swedenborg who make accurate predictions of future events whenever 
they tell us under the influence of truth drugs they they are now inspired by that a for which our existential 
formula is true and we may conceivably be able to build receivers to take their placereceivers which under 
certain circumstances turn out always to speak and to predict the truth 
 See Probability section  f p  For a similar result see my LScD section  p  f One might 
ascribe to a hypothesis the hypotheses discussed are universal laws   a probability calculated say by 
estimating the ratio between all the tests passed by it to all those conceivable tests which have not yet been 
attempted But this way too leads nowhere for this estimate can be computed with precision and the result is 
always that the probability is zero Another passage from this page is quoted in note  below 

 

 

according to his definition of degree of confirmation Carnap adopts two courses a he introduces ad hoc a new 
concept called the qualified   instance confirmation of the law l which is so defined that we sometimes obtain in 
place of zero a confirmation value close to  b he explains that natural laws are not really needed in science and 
that we can dispense with them Verificationism made them meaningless Confirmationism merely makes them 
unnecessary this is the gain which the weakening of the verifiability criterion achieves 

I shall now discuss a and b a little more fully 

a Carnap realizes of course that his zeroconfirmation of all laws is counterintuitive He therefore suggests 
measuring the intuitive reliability of a law by the degree of confirmation of an instance of the law see note  
above But he nowhere mentions that this new measure introduced on p  of Probability satisfies practically 
none of the criteria of adequacy and none of the theorems which have been built up on the preceding  pages 
This is so however and the reason is that the instance confirmation of a law l on the evidence e is simply not a 
probability function of l and e not a regular cfunction of l and e 

And it could hardly be otherwise We are given up to p  a detailed theory of confirmation in the sense of 
probability   On p  we find that for a law this confirmation is zero We are now faced with the following 
alternatives either i we accept the result as correct and consequently say that the degree of rational belief in a well
supported law cannot differ appreciably from zeroor from that of a refuted law or even from that of a self
contradictory sentence or ii we take the result as a refutation of the claim that our theory has supplied us with an 
adequate definition of degree of confirmation The ad hoc introduction of a new measure in order to escape from 

an unintended result is hardly an acceptable third possibility But what is most unsatisfactory is to take this 
momentous stepa break with the method of explication see note  below used so farwithout giving any 
warning to the reader this may result in the serious misconception that only a minor adjustment has been made 

For if we are to take probability or confirmation at all seriously then the adjustment could not have been more 
radical it replaces a confirmation function whose value is  by another whose value will be often close to  If we 
permit ourselves the freedom thus to introduce a new measure with no better justification than that the zero 
probability was counterintuitive while 

 
 I confine my discussion to what Carnap calls  Probability p  f the qualified instance confirmation a 
because Carnap prefers it as representing still more accurately our intuitions and b because in a sufficiently 
complex world with sufficiently many predicates the nonqualified instance confirmation leads in all interesting 
cases to extremely low confirmation values On the other hand the qualified instance confirmation this I mention 
only in passing is squarely hit by the socalled paradox of confirmation see Probability p  But this is a 
defect which I found can always be repairedin this case by making the two arguments of the definiens in  
p  symmetrical with respect to the two logically equivalent implicative formulations of l they become 
respectively after simplification j cid

 j This avoids the paradox 

 h and eh cid

 

 

the probability near to  seems to represent    still more accurately what is vaguely meant by the reliability of a law 
 then we can obtain for any sentence any probability or degree of confirmation we like 

Moreover Carnap nowhere attempts to show that the newly introduced instance confirmation is adequate or at least 
consistent which it is not see note  above No attempt is made for example to show that every refuted law 
obtains a lower instance confirmation than any of those which have stood up to tests 

That this minimum requirement cannot be satisfied even after repairing the inconsistency may be shown with the 
help of Carnaps example the law all swans are white This law ought to be considered as falsified if our evidence 
consists of a flock of one black and say  white swans But upon this evidence the instance confirmation 
instead of being zero will be very near to  The precise difference from  will depend upon the choice of the 
parameter  discussed below More generally if a theory is again and again falsified on the average in every n th 
instance then its qualified instance confirmation approaches  n instead of  as it ought to do so that the law 
All tossed pennies always show heads has the instance confirmation  instead of  

In discussing in my LScD a theory of Reichenbachs which leads to mathematically equivalent results  I 
described this unintended consequence of his theory as devastating After  years I still think it is 

b With his doctrine that laws may be dispensed with in science Carnap in effect returns to a position very similar to 
the one he had held in the heyday of verificationism viz that the language of science is molecular and which he 
had given up in the Syntax and in Testability Wittgenstein and Schlick finding that natural laws are non
verifiable concluded from this that they are not genuine sentences overlooking that they were thus committed to

 Probability p  Cp Meaning and Necessity section  pp  f The task of making more exact a 
vague or not quite exact concept    belongs to the most important tasks of logical analysis    We call this the 
task of    giving an explication for the earlier concept    See also Probability section  p  I must say 
here again only in passing that I disagree with Carnaps views on explication My main point is that I do not 
believe that one can speak about exactness except in the relative sense of exactness sufficient for a 
particular given purposethe purpose of solving a certain given problem Accordingly concepts cannot be 
explicated as such but only within the framework of a definite problemsituation Or in other words adequacy 
can only be judged if we are given a genuine problem it must not in its turn be a problem of explication for 
the solution of which the explication or analysis is undertaken 
 The confirmation values are identical if Carnaps  see below is zero and for any finite  the value of Carnaps 
instance confirmation approaches indefinitely with accumulating evidence the value criticized by me in my old 
discussion of Reichenbachs theory I quote from my LScD section  p  so far as it fits the present 
case The probability of this hypothesis I am speaking quite generally of universal laws would then be 
determined by the truth frequency of the singular statements which correspond to it ie which are its instances 
A hypothesis would thus have a probability of  if on the average it is contradicted by every second statement of 
this sequence ie by every second of its instances In order to escape from this devastating conclusion one 
might still try two more expedients One of these two leads to the zero probability of all universal laws the 
passage is quoted in note  above 

 

 

them meaningless pseudosentences Not unlike Mill they described them as rules for the derivation of genuine 
singular sentencesthe instances of the lawfrom other genuine sentences the initial conditions I criticized this 
doctrine in my LScD and when Carnap accepted my criticism in the Syntax and in Testability  I thought that 
the doctrine was dead But with Carnaps return to verificationism in a weakened form it has come to life again in a 
weakened form I do not think that the odds for its survival are good 

In one respect Carnap goes even further than Schlick Schlick believed that without laws we could not make 
predictions Carnap however asserts that the use of laws is not indispensable for making predictions  And he 
continues Nevertheless it is expedient of course to state universal laws in books on physics biology psychology 
etc Although these laws stated by scientists do not have a high degree of confirmation he writes but this is an 
understatement since their degree of confirmation could not be lower they have a high qualified instance 
confirmation    

While reading through this section of my paper Dr J Agassi has found a simple and I believe newparadox of 
inductive confirmation which he has permitted me to report here a It makes use of what I propose to call an 
Agassipredicatea factual predicate Ax which is so chosen as to hold for all individuals events or perhaps 
things occurring in the evidence at our disposal but not for the majority of the others For example we may choose 
at present to define Ax as x has occurred or has been observed before st January  Another choice 
Berkeleys choice as it werewould be x has been perceived Then it follows from Carnaps theory that with 
growing evidence the degree of confirmation of Aa must become indistinguishable from  for any individual a in 
the world present past or future And the same holds for the qualified or unqualified instance confirmation of the 
universal law xAxa law stating that all events in the world present past or future occur before  which 

makes  an upper bound for the duration of the world Clearly the famous cosmological problem of the 
approximate period of its creation can be equally easily dealt with Nevertheless it would hardly be expedient to state 
universal laws like those of Agassi in books on cosmologyin spite of their high instance confirmation 

In the last pages of Testability Carnap discussed the sentence If all minds    should disappear from the universe 
the stars would still go on in their courses Lewis and Schlick asserted correctly that this sentence was not 
verifiable and Carnap replied equally correctly in my opinion that it was a

Professor Nelson Goodman to whom I sent a stencilled copy of this paper has kindly informed me that he has 
anticipated Dr Agassi in the discovery of this paradox and of what I have here called an  Agassi predicate 

 

 

perfectly legitimate scientific assertion based as it was on well confirmed universal laws But by now universal 
laws have become dispensable and without them the sentence in question cannot possibly be upheld 
Moreover one sees easily from Agassis argument that a sentence that contradicts it can be maximally confirmed 

But I do not intend to use this one casethe status of natural lawsas my main argument in support of my contention 
that Carnaps analyses of confirmation and with it his criterion of demarcation are inadequate I therefore 
now proceed to offer in support of this contention arguments which are completely independent of the case of natural 
laws although they may allow us to see more clearly why this inadequacy was bound to arise in Carnaps theory 

As motto for my criticism I take the following challenging passage of Carnaps  

   if it could be shown that another method for instance a new definition for degree of confirmation 
leads in certain cases to numerical values more adequate than those furnished by C that would 
constitute an important criticism Or if someone    were to show that any adequate explicatum must 
fulfil a certain requirement and that C does not fulfil it it might be a helpful first step towards a better 
solution 

I shall take up both alternatives of this challenge but reverse their order  I shall show that an adequate concept of 
confirmation cannot satisfy the traditional rules of the calculus of probability  I shall give an alternative definition of 
degree of confirmation 

Ultimately I shall show  that Carnaps theory of confirmation appears to involve a an infinite regress and b an 
a priori theory of the mutual dependence of all atomic sentences with like predicates 

 To begin with I suggest that we distinguish not only between logical probability probability   and relative 
frequency probability   as Carnap does but between at least three different conceptsthe third being degree 
of confirmation 

Surely as a first suggestion this is unobjectionable we could still decide after due investigation that logical 
probability can be used as the explicandum for degree of confirmation Carnap unfortunately prejudges the 
issue He assumes without any further discussion that his distinction between two probability concepts is sufficient 
neglecting the warnings of my old book  

It can be shown that confirmation as Carnap himself understands this concept cannot be logical probability I offer 
three arguments 

 
 Probability section  p  
 LScD before section  Instead of discussing the probability of a hypothesis we should try to assess    
how far it has been corroborated or confirmed Or section  This shows that it is not so much the number of 
the corroborating confirming instances which determines its degree of corroboration as the severity of the 
various tests to which the hypothesis in question    has been subjected This in its turn depends upon the 
degree of testability    of the hypothesis    And section  A theory can be the better corroborated confirmed 
the better it is testable Testability however is converse to    logical probability    

 

 

a We can easily agree on the kind of thing we may both call provisionally probability for we both call probability 
something that satisfies the laws of the calculus of probability  

More specifically Carnap says of the concept of logical probability  that it satisfies certain axiom systems and in any 
case the special addition principle and general multiplication principle  Now it is an elementary consequence of 
the latter that the more a statement asserts the less probable it is This may be expressed by saying that 
the logical probability of a sentence x on a given evidence y decreases when the informative content of x increases 
 

But this is sufficient to show that a high probability cannot be one of the aims of science For the scientist is most 
interested in theories with a high content He does not care for highly probable trivialities but for bold and severely 
testable and severely tested hypotheses If as Carnap tells us a high degree of confirmation is one of the things 
we aim at in science then degree of confirmation cannot be identified with probability 

This may sound paradoxical to some people But if high probability were an aim of science then scientists should say 
as little as possible and preferably utter tautologies only But their aim is to advance science that is to add to its 
content Yet this means lowering its probability And in view of the high content of universal laws it is neither 
surprising to find that their probability is zero nor that those philosophers who believe that science must aim at high 
probabilities cannot do justice to facts such as these that the formulation and testing of universal laws is 
considered their most important aim by most scientists or that the intersubjective testability of science depends upon 

these laws as I pointed out in section  of my LScD 

From what has been said it should be clear that an adequately defined degree of confirmation cannot satisfy the 
general multiplication principle for probabilities  

 
 In a note in Mind   p  f I said that it was desirable to construct a system of axioms for probability 
in such a way that it can be    interpreted by any of the different interpretations of which the three most 
discussed are  the classical definition of probability as the ratio of the favourable to the equally possible cases 
 the frequency theory     the logical theory defining probability as the degree of a logical relation between 
sentences    I took this classification from LScD section  reversing the order of  and  A similar 
classification can be found in Probability p  Contrast also the discussion of the arguments of the 
probability function in my Mind note with Probability section  A  B and section  In this note I gave an 
independent formal axiom system which however I have much simplified since It was published in the BJPS 
  p  My Mind note has been now reprinted in LScD pp  

 Probability section  p  see also section  pp  ff 
 This is equivalent to the content condition see note  above Since Carnap considers this condition to be 
invalid  Probability section  p  consequence condition he is I believe committed to agreeing that 
degree of confirmation cannot be a regular confirmation function ie a probability  
 See sections  of my note Degree of Confirmation LScD pp  Dr Y BarHillel has drawn my 
attention to the fact that some of my examples were anticipated by Carnap in Probability section  p  f 
case  b Carnap infers from them that the content condition see notes  and  above is invalid but fails to 
infer that all regular confirmation functions are inadequate 

 

 

To sum up point a Since we aim in science at a high content we do not aim at a high probability 

b The severity of possible tests of a statement or a theory depends among other factors on the precision of its 
assertions and upon its predictive power in other words upon its informative content which increases with these two 
factors This may be expressed by saying that the degree of testability of a statement increases with its 
content But the better a statement can be tested the better it can be confirmed ie attested by its tests Thus we 
find that the opportunities of confirming a statement and accordingly the degree of its confirmability or corroborability 
or attestability increase with its testability and with its content  

To sum up point b Since we want a high degree of confirmation or corroboration we need a high 
content and thus a low absolute probability 

c Those who identify confirmation with probability must believe that a high degree of probability is desirable They 
implicitly accept the rule Always choose the most probable hypothesis 

Now it can be easily shown that this rule is equivalent to the following rule Always choose the hypothesis which goes 
as little beyond the evidence as possible And this in turn can be shown to be equivalent not only to Always accept 

the hypothesis with the lowest content within the limits of your task for example your task of predicting but also to 
Always choose the hypothesis which has the highest degree of ad hoc character within the limits of your task 
This is an unintended consequence of the fact that a highly probable hypothesis is one which fits the known facts 
going as little as possible beyond them 

But it is well known that ad hoc hypotheses are disliked by scientists they are at best stopgaps not real aims 
Scientists prefer a bold hypothesis because it can be more severely tested and independently tested 

To sum up point c Aiming at high probability entails a counterintuitive rule favouring ad hoc 
hypotheses 

These three arguments exemplify my own point of view for I see in a confirming instance the result of a severe 
test or of an attempted but unsuccessful refutation of the theory Those on the other hand who do not look for 
severe tests but rather for confirmation in the sense of the old idea of verification or a weakened version of it 
come to a different idea of confirmability a sentence will be the better confirmable the more nearly verifiable it is or 
the more nearly deducible from observation sentences It is clear in this case that universal laws are not as in our 
analysis highly confirmable but that owing to their high content their confirmability will be zero 

 In taking up the challenge to construct a better definition of confirmation I wish to say first that I do not believe 
that it is possible to give a completely satisfactory definition My reason is that a theory which has been tested with 
great ingenuity and with the sincere attempt to refute it will have 

 
 For a fuller argument see LScD sections  f 

 

 

a higher degree of confirmation than one which has been tested with laxity and I do not think that we can completely 
formalize what we mean by an ingenious and sincere test  Nor do I think that it is an important task to give an 
adequate definition of degree of confirmation In my view the importance if any of giving the best possible definition 
lies in the fact that such a definition shows clearly the inadequacy of all probability theories posing as theories of 
induction I have given what I consider a reasonably adequate definition elsewhere  I may give here a slightly 
simpler definition which satisfies the same desiderata or conditions of adequacy 

Here Cxy means the degree of confirmation of x by y while pxy and px are relative and absolute 
probabilities respectively The definition can be relativized 

 

 

Here z should be taken as the general background knowledge the old evidence and old and new initial conditions 
including if we wish accepted theories while y should be taken as representing those new observational results 
excluded from z which may be claimed to confirm the new explanatory hypothesis x  

My definition satisfies among other conditions of adequacy  the condition that the confirmability of a statement
its highest degree of confirmation equals its content ie the degree of its testability 

Another important property of this concept is that it satisfies the condition that the severity of a test measured by the 
improbability of the testinstance has an almostadditive influence upon the resultant degree of confirmation of the 
theory This shows that some at least of the intuitive demands are satisfied 

My definition does not automatically exclude ad hoc hypotheses but it can be shown to give most reasonable 
results if combined with a rule excluding ad hoc hypotheses  

 
 See the end of my note Degree of Confirmation referred to in note   LScD p  
 Degree of Confirmation LScD p  f Cp my remark p  The particular way in which Cxy is here 
defined I consider unimportant What may be important are the desiderata and the fact that they can be 
satisfied together 
 That is to say the total evidence e is to be partitioned into y and z and y and z should be so chosen as to give C
xyz the highest value possible for x on the available total evidence 
 Called desiderata in the note in question Kemeny has rightly stressed that the conditions of adequacy should 
not be introduced to fit the explicatum That this is not the case here is perhaps best proved by the fact that I have 
now improved my definition by simplifying it without changing my desiderata 
 The rule for the exclusion of ad hoc hypotheses may take the following form the hypothesis must not repeat 
except in a completely generalized form the evidence or any conjunctive component of it That is to say x  
This swan is white is not acceptable as a hypothesis to explain the evidence y  This swan is white although 
All swans are white would be acceptable and no explanation x of y must be circular in this sense with respect to 
any nonredundant conjunctive component of y This leads to an emphasis upon universal laws as 
indispensable while Carnap believes as we have seen see above and Probability section  H esp p 
 that universal laws can be dispensed with 

 

 

So much about my own present positive theory which goes very considerably beyond my LScD But I must 
return to my critical task I believe that my positive theory strongly suggests that the fault lies with the verificationist 
and inductivist approach whichin spite of the attention paid to my criticism has never been completely abandoned 
by Carnap But inductive logic is impossible I shall try to show this following my old L Sc D as my last 
critical point 

 I asserted in my LScD  that an inductive logic must involve either a an infinite regress discovered by 
Hume or b the acceptance with Kant of some synthetic principle as valid a priori I have a strong suspicion that 
Carnaps theory of induction can be criticized as involving both a and b 

a If we need in order to justify induction as probable a probable principle of induction such as a principle 
of the uniformity of nature then we also need a second such principle in order to justify the induction of the first 
Carnap in his section on the Presuppositions of Induction  introduces a principle of uniformity He does not 
mention the objection of a regress but a remark in his exposition seems to indicate that he has it in mind The 
opponents he writes p  would perhaps say that the statement of the probability of uniformity must be taken as 
a factual statement   Our reply is    this statement is itself analytic I was far from convinced by Carnaps 
arguments but since he indicates that the whole problem of the justification and the presupposition of inductive 
method will be treated in a later volume in more exact technical terms it is perhaps better to suppress at this 
stage my inclination to offer a proof that no such principle of uniformity can be analytic except in a Pickwickian 
sense of analytic especially since my discussion of point b will perhaps indicate the lines on which a proof of this 
kind might proceed 

b Natural laws or more generally scientific theories whether of a causal or a statistical character are hypotheses 
about some dependence They assert roughly speaking that certain events or statements describing them are 
in fact not independent of others although so far as their purely logical relations go they are independent Let us 
take two possible facts which are we first assume completely unconnected say  Chunky is clever and  Sandy is 
clever described by the two statements x and y Then somebody may conjectureperhaps mistakenlythat they 
are connected that Chunky is a relation of Sandys and that the information or evidence y increases the probability 
of x If he is wrong that is if x and y are independent then we have 

 pxy  px 

 
 Probability section  F pp  ff especially pp   For the passages from LScD see section  
pp f and  pp  f 

 

 

which is equivalent to 

 pxy  pxpy 

This is the usual definition of independence 

If the conjecture that the events are connected or interdependent is correct then we have 

 pxy  px 

that is the information y raises the probability of x above its absolute or initial value px 

I believeas I think most empiricists dothat any such conjecture about the interdependence or correlation of events 
should be formulated as a separate hypothesis or as a natural law Cleverness runs in families to be submitted first 
to a process of careful formulation with the aim of making it as highly testable as possible and after that to severe 
empirical tests 

Carnap is of a different opinion He proposes that we accept as probable a principle to the effect that the evidence  
Sandy is clever increases the probability of A is clever for any individual Awhether A is the name of a cat a dog 
an apple a tennis ball or a cathedral This is a consequence of the definition of degree of confirmation which he 
proposes According to this definition any two sentences with the same predicate clever or sick and different 
subjects are interdependent or positively correlated whatever the subject may be and wherever they may be 
situated in the world this is the actual content of his principle of uniformity 

I am far from certain whether he has realized these consequences of his theory for he nowhere mentions them 
explicitly But he introduces a universal parameter which he calls  and    turns out on a simple mathematical 
calculation to be the reciprocal of the logical correlation coefficient  for any two sentences with the same predicate 
and different subjects  The assumption that  is infinite corresponds to the assumption of independence 

According to Carnap we are bound to choose a finite value of  when we wish to choose our definition of the 
probability  function The choice of  and with it of the degree of correlation between any two sentences with the 
same predicate thus appears to be part of a decision or convention the choice of a definition of probability It looks 
therefore as if no statement about the 

 
 The logical correlation coefficient of x and y can be defined as pxy  pxpy pxpypx  p Admitting 
this formula for all regular probability functions means a slight generalization of a suggestion which is made in 
Kemeny and Oppenheim Degree of Factual Support Philos of Sci  p  formula  for a special 
probability function in which all atomic sentences are absolutely independent It so happens that I think that this 
special function is the only one which is adequate 

 We can prove this for example by taking Methods p  formula  putting s  sM  wk  cx  cx    c

y and replacing chMeM by cxy We obtain   cx  ycxy  cxcy which shows that  is the 
reciprocal of a dependencemeasure and from this     cxy  cxcycx  cy which as cx  cx   
 cy is the logical correlation coefficientI may perhaps say here that I prefer the term dependence to Keynes 
and Carnaps term relevance looking like Carnap at probability as a generalized deductive logic I take 
probabilistic dependence as a generalization of logical dependence 

 

 

world was involved in the choice of  But it is a fact that our choice of  is equivalent to the most sweeping assertion 
of dependence that one can imagine It is equivalent to the acceptance of as many natural laws as there are 
predicates each asserting the same degree of dependence of any two events with like predicates in the world And 
since such an assumption about the world is made in the form of a nontestable actthe introduction of a definition
there seems to me an element of apriorism involved 

One might still say perhaps that there is no apriorism here since the dependencies mentioned are a consequence 
of a definition that of probability or degree of confirmation which rests on a convention or a decision and is 
therefore analytic But Carnap gives two reasons for his choice of his confirmation function which do not seem to fit 
this view The first of the two reasons I have in mind is that his confirmation function as he remarks is the only one 
among those which suggest themselves which is not entirely inadequate  Inadequate that is for explaining or 
explicating the undoubted fact that we can learn from experience Now this fact is empirical and a theory 
whose adequacy is judged by its ability to explain or cohere with this fact does not quite look like being analytic It is 
interesting to see that Carnaps argument in favour of his choice of  which I am suspecting of apriorism is the 
same as Kants or Russells or Jeffreyss it is what Kant called a transcendental argument How is knowledge 
possible the appeal to the fact that we possess empirical knowledge ie that we can learn from experience The 
second of the two reasons is Carnaps argument that the adoption of an appropriate  one which is neither infinite 
for an infinite  is equivalent to independence nor zero would be more successful in nearly all universes except in 
the two extreme cases in which all individuals are independent or have like properties All these reasons seem to me 
to suggest that the choice of  ie of a confirmation function is to depend upon its success or upon the probability of 
its success in the world But then it would not be analyticin spite of the fact that it is also a decision concerning the 
adoption of a definition I think that it can be explained how this may be so We can if we like define the word truth 
so that it comprises some of those statements we usually call false Similarly we can define probable or confirmed 
so that absurd statements get a high probability All this is purely conventional or verbal as long as we do not take 
these definitions as adequate explications But if we do then the question is no longer conventional or analytic For 
to say of a contingent or factual statement x that it is true in an adequate sense of the word true is to make 
a factual statement and so it is with x is now highly probable It is the same with x is strongly dependent upon y 
and x is independent of ythe statements whose fate is decided upon when we choose  The choice of  is 
therefore indeed equivalent to that of adopting a sweeping though unformulated statement about the general 
interdependence or uniformity of the world 

But this statement is adopted without any empirical evidence Indeed 

 
 Probability section  p  cp Methods section  p  

 

Carnap shows  that without adopting it we can never learn from empirical evidence according to his theory of 
knowledge Thus empirical evidence does not and cannot count before the adoption of a finite  This is why it has 
to be adopted a priori 

The principle of empiricism Carnap writes in another context  can be violated only by the assertion of a factual 
synthetic sentence without a sufficient empirical foundation or by the thesis of apriorism when it contends that for 
knowledge with respect to certain factual sentences no empirical foundation is required I believe that what we have 
observed here shows that there is a third way of violating the principle of empiricism We have seen how it can be 
violated by constructing a theory of knowledge which cannot do without a principle of inductiona principle that tells 
us in effect that the world is or very probably is a place in which men can learn from experience and that it will 
remain or very probably remain so in future I do not believe that a cosmological principle of this kind can be a 
principle of pure logic But it is introduced in such a way that it cannot be based upon experience either It therefore 
seems to me that it cannot be anything else but a principle of a priori metaphysics 

Nothing but the synthetic the factual character of  seems to be able to explain Carnaps suggestion that we may try 
out which value of  is most successful in a given world But since empirical evidence does not count without the prior 
adoption of a finite  there can be no clear procedure for testing the  chosen by the method of trial and error My 
own feeling is that I prefer in any case to apply the method of trial and error to the universal laws which are 
indispensable for intersubjective science which are clearly and admittedly factual and which we may succeed in 
making severely testable with the aim of eliminating all those theories that can be discovered to be erroneous 

I am glad to have been given an opportunity to get these matters off my mindor off my chest as physicalists might 
say I do not doubt that with another vacation in the Tyrol and another climb up the Semantische Schnuppe 
Carnap and I could reach agreement on most of these points for we both I trust belong to the fraternity of 
rationaliststhe fraternity of those who are eager to argue and to learn from one another But since the physical gap 
between us seems unbridgeable I now send to him across the oceanknowing that I shall soon be at the receiving 
endthese my best barbed arrows with my best brotherly regards

LANGUAGE AND THE BODYMIND PROBLEM  
A RESTATEMENT OF INTERACTIONISM 
 INTRODUCTION 

THIS IS a paper on the impossibility of a physicalistic causal theory of the human language  

 It is not a paper on linguistic analysis the analysis of wordusages For I completely reject the claim of certain 
language analysts that the source of philosophical difficulties is to be found in the misuse of language No doubt 
some people talk nonsense but I claim a that there does not exist a logical or languageanalytical method of 
detecting philosophical nonsense which by the way does not stop short of the ranks of logicians language analysts 
and semanticists b that the belief that such a method existsthe belief more especially that philosophical 
nonsense can be unmasked as due to what Russell might have called typemistakes and what nowadays are 
sometimes called categorymistakesis the aftermath of a philosophy of language which has since turned out to be 
baseless 

 It is the result of Russells early belief that a formula like x is an element of x is essentially or intrinsically 
meaningless We now know that this is not so Although we can indeed construct a formalism F  theory of types 
in which the formula in question is not wellformed or meaningless we can construct another formalism a typefree 
formalism F  in which the formula is wellformed or meaningful The fact that a doubtful expression cannot be 
translated into a meaningful expression of a given F  does not therefore establish that there exists no F  such that 
the doubtful formula in question can be translated into a meaningful statement of F  In other words we are never 
able to say in doubtful cases that a certain formula as used by some 

 

 This issue was first discussed by Karl Bhler in his Sprachtheorie  pp  

 

 

speaker is meaningless in any precise sense of this term for somebody may invent a formalism such that the 
formula in question can be rendered by a wellformed formula of that formalism to the satisfaction of the original 
speaker The most one can say is I do not see how such a formalism can be constructed 

 As for the bodymind problem I wish to reject the following two different theses of the language analyst  The 
problem can be solved by pointing out that there are two languages a physical and a psychological language but not 
two kinds of entities bodies and minds  The problem is due to a faulty way of talking about minds ie it is due to 
talking as if mental states exist in addition to behaviour while all that exists is behaviour of varying character for 
example intelligent and unintelligent behaviour 

 I assert that  the twolanguage solution is no longer tenable It arose out of neutral monism the view that 
physics and psychology are two ways of constructing theories or languages out of some neutral given material and 

that the statements of physics and of psychology are abbreviated statements about that given material and 
therefore translatable into one another that they are two ways of talking about the same facts But the idea of a 
mutual translatability had to be given up long ago With it the twolanguage solution disappears For if the two 
languages are not intertranslatable then they deal with different kinds of facts The relation between these kinds of 
facts constitutes our problem which can therefore only be formulated by constructing one language in which we can 
speak about both kinds of facts 

 Since  is so vague we must ask Is there or is there not the stationmasters belief that the train is leaving in 
addition to his belieflike behaviour Is there his intention to communicate a fact about the train to the signalman in 
addition to his making the appropriate movements Is there the signalmans understanding of the message in 
addition to his understandinglike behaviour Is it possible that the signalman understood the message perfectly 
well but behaved for some reason or other as if he had misunderstood it 

 If as I think the answer to these questions is yes then the bodymind problem arises in its classical Cartesian 
form If the answer is no then we are faced with a philosophical theory which may be called physicalism or 
behaviourism If the questions are not answered but dismissed as meaningless if more especially we are told that 
to ask whether Peter has a toothache in addition to his toothachelike behaviour is meaningless because all that 
can be known about his toothache is known through observing his behaviour then we are faced with the positivists 
mistaken belief that a fact is or is reducible to the sum total of the evidence in its favourie with the verifiability 
dogma of meaning Cf  below and my Logic of Scientific Discovery  

 An important assumption of what follows here is that the deterministic interpretation of physics even of 
classical physics is a misinterpretation and that there are no scientific reasons in favour of determinism

 FOUR MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF LANGUAGE 

 Karl Bhler appears to have been the first to propose in   the doctrine of the three functions of language  
the expressive or symptomatic function  the stimulative or signal function  the descriptive function To these I 
have added  the argumentative function which can be distinguished  from function  It is not asserted that there 
are no other functions such as prescriptive advisory etc but it is asserted that these four functions mentioned 
constitute a hierarchy in the sense that each of the higher ones cannot be present without all those which are 
lower while the lower ones may be present without the higher ones 

 An argument for example serves as an expression in so far as it is an outward symptom of some internal state 
whether physical or psychological is here irrelevant of the organism It is also a signal since it may provoke a reply 
or agreement In so far as it is about something and supports a view of some situation or state of affairs it is 
descriptive And lastly there is its argumentative function its giving reasons for holding this view eg by pointing 
out difficulties or even inconsistencies in an alternative view 

 A GROUP OF THESES 

 The primary interest of science and philosophy lies in their descriptive and argumentative functions the interest of 
behaviourism or physicalism for example can only lie in the cogency of their critical arguments 

 Whether a person does in fact describe or argue or whether he merely expresses or signals depends on 
whether he speaks intentionally about something or intentionally supports or attacks some view 

 The linguistic behaviour of two persons or of the same person at two different dates may be indistinguishable 
yet the one may in fact describe or argue while the other may only express and stimulate 

 Any causal physicalistic theory of linguistic behaviour can only be a theory of the two lower 
functions of language 

 Any such theory is therefore bound either to ignore the difference between the higher and 
lower functions or to assert that the two higher functions are nothing but special cases of the 
two lower functions 

 This holds more especially for such philosophies as behaviourism and the philosophies which try to rescue the 
causal completeness or selfsufficiency of the physical world such as epiphenomenalism psychophysical 
parallelism the twolanguage solutions physicalism and materialism All these are selfdefeating in so far as their 
arguments establishunintentionally of coursethe nonexistence of arguments

 THE MACHINE ARGUMENT 

 A wallthermometer may be said not only to express its internal state but also to signal and even to describe A 
selfregistering one does so even in writing Yet we do not attribute the responsibility for the description to it we 
attribute it to its maker Once we understand this situation we see that it does not describe any more than my pen 
does like my pen it is only an instrument for describing But it expresses its own state and it signals 

 The situation outlined in  is fundamentally the same for all physical machines however complicated 

 It may be objected that example  is too simple and that by complicating the machine and the situation we 
may obtain true descriptive behaviour Let us therefore consider more complex machines By way of concession to 
my opponents I shall even assume that machines can be constructed to any behaviouristic specification 

 Consider a machine invested with a lens an analyser and a speaking apparatus which pronounces whenever 

a physical body cf medium size appears before its lens the name of this body cat dog etc or says in some 
cases I dont know Its behaviour can be made even more humanlike  by making it do this not always but only in 
response to a stimulus question Can you tell me what this thing is etc  by making it in a percentage of cases 
reply I am getting tired let me alone for a while etc Other responses can be introduced and variedperhaps 
according to inbuilt probabilities 

 If the behaviour of such a machine becomes very much like that of a man then we may mistakenly believe that 
the machine describes and argues just as a manwho does not know the working of a phonograph or radio may 
mistakenly think that it describes and argues Yet an analysis of its mechanism teaches us that nothing of this kind 
happens The radio does not argue although it expresses and signals 

 There is in principle no difference between a wallthermometer and the observing and describing machine 
discussed Even a man who is conditioned to react to appropriate stimuli with the sounds cat and dog without 
intention to describe or to name does not describe although he expresses and signals 

 But let us assume that we find a physical machine whose mechanism we do not understand and whose 
behaviour is very human We may then wonder whether it does not perhaps act intentionally rather than 
mechanically causally or probabilistically ie whether it does not have a mind after all whether we should not be 
very careful to avoid causing it pain etc But once we realize completely how it is constructed how it can be copied 
who is responsible for its design etc no degree of complexity will make it different in kind from an automatic pilot or 
a watch or a wallthermometer 

 Objections to this view and to the view  are usually based on the positivistic doctrine of the identity of 
empirically indistinguishable objects 

 

 

Two clocks the argument goes may look alike although the one works mechanically and the other electrically but 
their difference can be discovered by observation If no difference can be so discovered then there simply is none 
Reply if we find two pound notes which are physically indistinguishable even as to the number we may have good 
reason to believe that one of them at least is forged and a forged note does not become genuine because the 
forgery is perfect or because all historical traces of the act of forgery have disappeared 

 Once we understand the causal behaviour of the machine we realize that its behaviour is purely expressive or 
symptomatic For amusement we may continue to ask the machine questions but we shall not seriously argue with it
unless we believe that it transmits the arguments both from a person and back to a person 

 This I think solves the socalled problem of other minds If we talk to other people and especially if we argue 
with them then we assume sometimes mistakenly that they also argue that they speak intentionally about 
things seriously wishing to solve a problem and not merely behaving as if they were doing so It has often been seen 
that language is a social affair and that solipsism and doubts about the existence of other minds become 
selfcontradictory if formulated in a language We can put this now more clearly In arguing with other people a thing 
which we have learnt from other people for example about other minds we cannot but attribute to them intentions 
and this means mental states We do not argue with a thermometer 

 THE CAUSAL THEORY OF NAMING 

 But there are stronger reasons Consider a machine which every time it sees a ginger cat says  Mike It 
represents we may be tempted to say a causal model of naming or of the namerelation 

 But this causal model is deficient We shall express this by saying that it is not and cannot be a causal 
realization of the namerelation Our thesis is that a causal realization of the namerelation cannot exist 

 We admit that the machine may be described as realizing what we may loosely call a causal chain  of events 
joining Mike the cat with  Mike its name But there are reasons why we cannot accept this causal chain as a 
representation or realization of the relation between a thing and its name 

 It is nave to look at this chain of events as beginning with the appearance of Mike and ending with the 
enunciation  Mike 

It begins if at all with a state of the machine prior to the appearance of Mike a state in which the machine is as it 
were ready to respond to the appearance of Mike It ends if at all not with the enunciation of a word since there is 
a state following this All this is true of the corresponding human response if causally considered It is our 
interpretation which makes 

 

 It does not matter for our present purposes whether or not the expression causal chain is adequate for a more 
thorough analysis of causal relations 

 

 

Mike and  Mike the extremes or terms of the causal chain and not the objective physical situation Moreover we 
might consider the whole process of reaction as name or only the last letters of  Mike say  Ike Thus 
although those who know or understand the namerelation may choose to interpret a causal chain as a model of it it 
is clear that the namerelation is not a causal relation and cannot be realized by any causal model The same holds 
for all abstract eg logical relations even for the simplest oneone relation 

 The namerelation is therefore clearly not to be realized by say an association model or a conditioned reflex 
model of whatever complexity It involves some kind of knowledge that  Mike is by some convention the name 
of the cat Mike and some kind of intention to use it as a name 

 Naming is by far the simplest case of a descriptive use of words Since no causal realization of the namerelation 
is possible no causal physical theory of the descriptive and argumentative functions of language 
is possible 

 INTERACTION 

 It is true that the presence of Mike in my environment may be one of the physical causes of my saying Here is 

Mike But if I say Should this be your argument then it is contradictory because I have grasped or realized that it is 
so then there was no physical cause analogous to Mike I do not need to hear or see your words in order to realize 
that a certain theory it does not matter whose is contradictory The analogy is not to Mike but rather to my 
realization that Mike is here This realization of mine may be causally but not purely physically connected with 
the physical presence of Mike 

 Logical relationships such as consistency do not belong to the physical world They are abstractions perhaps 
products of the mind But my realization of an inconsistency may lead me to act in the physical world precisely as 
may my realization of the presence of Mike Our mind may be said to be as capable of being swayed by logical or 
mathematical or say musical relationships as by a physical presence 

 There is no reason except a mistaken physical determinism why mental states and physical states should not 
interact The old argument that things so different could not interact was based on a theory of causation which has 
long been superseded 

 If we act through being influenced by the grasp of an abstract relationship we initiate physical causal chains 
which have no sufficient physical causal antecedents We are then first movers or creators of a physical causal 
chain 

 CONCLUSION 

The fear of obscurantism or of being judged an obscurantist has prevented most antiobscurantists from saying 
such things as these But this fear has produced in the end only obscurantism of another kind 

 

 

  
A NOTE ON THE BODYMIND PROBLEM 

I AM very grateful to Professor Wilfrid Sellars for bringing  my paper Language and the BodyMind Problem  to the 
attention of philosophers and even more for his kindness in describing it as challenging and as telling if uneven 
Of its unevenness nobody can be more aware than I I think I am more sensitive to it than Andersens princess was to 
the pea And although I am inclined to count its six leaves among my scanty laurels I could not rest on them even if I 
wished to But the small hard peas which bother me and keep me awake at night seem to have been well hidden and 
in a spot far removed from Professor Sellars two largish lumps of stuffing which I believe are not at all hard to 
smooth out 

 As to the first lump Professor Sellars after quoting me correctly at some length proceeds to focus attention as 
he puts it On the statement  Poppers statement quoted above that    if the two languages are not translatable 
they deal with different sets of facts And Professor Sellars then goes on to say that a fact may be either a 
descriptive fact or else something like the fact that we ought to fulfil our undertakings which I may be permitted 
to call a quasi fact And he says that my argument would be valid if only it would contain the premise that both 
languages in question have the business of describing ie of stating descriptive facts 

Now I agree with every word of this but I completely fail to see its relevance in focusing attention upon one 
statement Professor Sellars understandably enough got its context out of focus 

For a the premise which according to Professor Sellars makes my argument valid was clearly enough indicated 
in my own argument which therefore is itself valid according to Professor Sellars Moreover my argument has the 
form of a reductio ad absurdum of the two language theory and the premise 

 

 By way of his A Note on Poppers argument for Dualism Analysis  pp  f 
 Not Mindbody problem as Professor Sellars writes My paper is included in this volume as ch  

 

 

correctly demanded by Professor Sellars is not mine but part of that theory It is indeed referred to in my argument 
as part of the two language solution of the view that    the statements of physics and of psychology are    two 
ways of talking about the same facts which clearly indicates that these facts are descriptive facts in Professor 
Sellars terminology My own contribution consisted simply in pointing out that once the two languages of physics 
and of psychology are admitted not to be translatable into each other they cannot any longer be said to talk about 
the same facts and must be admitted to talk about different factswhere facts means whatever the twolanguage 
theorists meant when they said that physics and psychology talked about the same facts 

Thus the problem of quasi facts simply does not arise 

All this can be verified by reading more closely the passage from my paper which Professor Sellars himself quotes at 
the beginning of his paper it is the passage which gets out of focus once he focuses attention on part of it There is 
a not very important misquotationset instead of kindin the focused passage 

So no hard core no difference of opinion as far as I can see underlies Professor Sellars first lumpalthough I seem 
to differ with him about the relevance of his comments 

 Now to smooth out the second lump In the later sections of his paper Professor Sellars writes  Professor 
Popper makes a telling if uneven defence of the thesis that aboutness or reference cannot be defined in 
Behaviourese  Professor Sellars himself believes in the truth of this alleged thesis of mine I must confess that I 
was surprised when I read this I was not aware of having ever tried to defend anything of the kind It happens to be 
one of my oldest convictions that a thesis of the kind here attributed to methat such and such cannot be defined 
in somebodys languageis nearly always irrelevant It is not irrelevant of course if the opponents thesis was 
one about definability Definability may be interesting in certain contexts but to say a term is not definable never 
implies that it cannot be legitimately used for it may be legitimately used as an undefined term There was no need 
for me to read through my paper in order to be sure that I never maintained anything like the thesis attributed to me 
by Professor Sellars But to make doubly sure I did read through my paper and I found no trace of such a thesis on 
definability And to make trebly sure I herewith publicly recant any theory I may ever have advanced based upon the 
thesis attributed to me by Professor Sellars not because the thesis is false I agree with Professor Sellars that it is 
true and I even agree that my arguments might be used to support its truthwhich may perhaps explain the 
misunderstanding but because I should hate the idea of philosophizing with the help of arguments about non
definability 

Professor Sellars goes on to say And he  Popper  is surely right in holding the thesis I have just repudiated 
However at this stage he  Popper  tacitly adds the premise E is about x is a descriptive assertion 

 

 

It is hard for me to check whether or not I have added this premise tacitly at this stage since this stage is not 
indicated by Professor Sellarsor only indicated with the help of a reference to that alleged thesis of mine which I fail 
to find anywhere in my paper I may here warn readers that seven of the passages in quotation marks in this second 
part of Professor Sellars paper are not quotations from my paper as some might think Two others Name relation 
and Causalphysicalistic did occur in my paper but the former hyphened the latter unhyphened 

If however I have somewhere tacitly and unconsciously added the premise which Professor Sellars says I have 
added I cannot detect any trace of it then I wish again to recant For I am in complete agreement with Professor 
Sellars thesis that if a statement A says that another statement E is about something then A usually does not to 
use Professor Sellars words play the same sort of a role as The Moon is round  A need not be and usually is not 
descriptive in the same sense as the statement about the moon although it may be What was your last lecture 
aboutIt was a lecture about probability is an instance of descriptive usage 

I also agree entirely with Professor Sellars concluding remark that from the fact and it is a fact that what Professor 
Popper calls the name relation paragraph  ff is not definable in causalphysicalistic terms we cannot conclude 
to the truth of Dualism Exactly This is why I never said anything about definability Indeed had I no stronger 
arguments in favour of my dualistic faith than this completely irrelevant fact for I agree that it is a fact though 
completely irrelevant then I should be readynay most anxiousto give up dualism As it happens my arguments 
were quite different They were about  the possible scope of deductive physical theories rather than about 
definability and my thesis was that no causal physical theory of the descriptive and argumentative 
functions of language is possible 

I wish to make it perfectly clear that I have no objection whatever to Professor Sellars thesisthat a statement such 
as E is about x is ordinarily or frequently a device whereby we convey to the hearer how a mentioned 
expression is used by using an equivalent expression Nor do I deny that this thesis of Professor Sellars is relevant 
to my own thesis All I wish to say under  is that my thesis is not based on the argument about definability which 
Professor Sellars ascribes to me If it were I should retract it 

 There is a remark on Professor Ryles views in Professor Sellars paper with which I cannot agree Professor 
Sellars writes I also agree that the idea of a mutual translatability of    mind talk and behaviour talk had to be 
given up long since in spite of Ryles valiant efforts to the contrary 

To this I should like to say that I am not aware of the fact that Professor Ryle has ever held what I call the two 
languages theory How could he believing as he does that the problem arises out of categorymistakes within the 
one natural language It is not to him I was alluding in that place 

At the same time it is perfectly true that I had Professor Ryle in mind 

 

 This is another instance of an aboutstatement A which describes an argument E 

 

 

when in another paragraph of my paper I tried to show briefly that the theory of categorymistakes is also 
untenable 

If I might here add to my arguments another then I should say this Assuming that by the usages of our language 
expressions naming physical states are put in a category different from that in which expressions naming mental 
states are put I should be inclined to see in this fact an indication or a suggestion not more than this to be sure 
that these two categories of expression name entities which are ontologically differentor in other words that they 
are different kinds of entities Thus I should be inclined not more than this to entertain the opposite conclusion 
to the one drawn by Professor Ryle although admittedly the premises would be insufficient for a formal derivation of 
the conclusion 

However I am not prepared to grant the truth of this assumption quite apart from my and from Professor Smarts   
objections to arguments based upon the idea of categorymistakes I find very many of Professor Ryles analyses 
most illuminating but I can only say that ordinary English very often treats mental states and physical states on a par 
with each other not only where it speaks of a mental disease of a hospital for the mentally sick or of a man who is 
both physically and mentally well balanced etc these cases might be dismissed as deriving from a philosophical 
dualism but especially where we say Thinking of sheep always helps me to fall asleep or Reading Mr Smiths 
novels always helps me to fall asleep which does not mean training my eyes on one of Mr Smiths novels always 
helps me to fall asleep and yet is completely analogous to taking bromide always helps me to fall asleep There are 
countless similar examples They certainly do not establish that ordinary English words describing mental states and 
physical states always belong to the same category  Professor Ryle has succeeded in showing that they dont 
But my examples establish I think that the words are often used in ways which are strikingly alike The uncertainty of 
the languagesituation may be illustrated by an example of Professor Ryles  He says rightly that a child who has 
just watched the parade of all the battalions batteries and squadrons which constitute a division makes a mistake 
in the sense that he has not quite got the meaning of the words when he then asks And when will the division 
comeHe would Professor Ryle says be shown his mistake by being told that in watching the battalions batteries 
and squadrons marching past he had been watching the division marching past The marchpast was not a parade of 
battalions    and a division it was a parade of the battalions    of a division This is absolutely true But are there 
no contexts of perfectly good English usage in which battalions are treated on a par with divisions Could there not 
be a parade of say one division and three battalions and two batteries I can imagine that 

 

 See his excellent brief A Note of Categories in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science  
 pp  f 
 The Concept of Mind p  f The example of the Colleges and the University is precisely analogous 

 

 

 

this might be an outrage to military usage although a battle in which a division attacks a battalion is I suppose 
perfectly good military usage But is it an outrage to ordinary English usage And if not can the mistake which the 
child undoubtedly committed be a category mistake And if not do we not commit a category mistake assuming 
such a thing exists if we wrongly diagnose that the childs mistake was a category mistake 

 

  
SELFREFERENCE AND MEANING IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE 

Theaetetus Now listen to me attentively Socrates for what I shall put before you is not a little 
tricky 

Socrates I promise to do my best Theaetetus so long as you spare me the details of your 
achievements in the theory of numbers and speak in a language which I an ordinary man can 
understand 

Th The very next question which I am going to ask you is an extraordinary one although expressed 
in perfectly ordinary language 

S There is no need to warn me I am all ears 

Th What did I say between your last two interruptions Socrates 

S You said The very next question which I am going to ask you is an extraordinary one although 
expressed in perfectly ordinary language 

Th And did you understand what I was saying 

S I did of course your warning referred to a question which you intended to ask me 

Th And what was this question of mine to which my warning referred Can you repeat it 

S Your question Let me see    Oh yes your question was What did I say between your last two 
interruptions Socrates 

Th I see you have kept your promise Socrates you did attend to what I was saying But did you 
understand this question of mine which you have just quoted 

S I think I can prove that I understood your question at once For did I not reply correctly when you 
first put it to me 

Th That is so But do you agree that it was an extraordinary question 

S No Admittedly it was not very politely put Theaetetus but this I am afraid is nothing out of the 
ordinary No I cant see anything extraordinary in it 

Th I am sorry if l was rude Socrates believe me I only wanted to be brief which was of some 
importance at that stage of our discussion But I find 

 

 

it interesting that you think my question an ordinary one apart from its rudeness for some 
philosophers might say that it is an impossible questionat any rate one which it is impossible to 
understand properly since it can have no meaning 

S Why should your question have no meaning 

Th Because indirectly it referred to itself 

S I do not see this As far as I can see your question only referred to the warning you gave me just 
before you asked it 

Th And what did my warning refer to 

S Now I see what you mean Your warning referred to your question and your question to your 
warning 

Th But you say that you understood both my warning and my question 

S I had no trouble at all in understanding what you said 

Th This seems to prove that two things a person says may be perfectly meaningful in spite of the 
fact that they are indirectly selfreferringthat the first refers to the second and the second to the first 

S It does seem to prove it 

Th And dont you think that this is extraordinary 

S To me it does not appear extraordinary It seems obvious I do not see why you should bother to 
draw my attention to such a truism 

Th Because it has been denied at least implicitly by many philosophers 

S Has it You surprise me 

Th I mean the philosophers who say that a paradox such as the Liar the Megaric version of the 
Epimenides cannot arise because a meaningful and properly constructed statement cannot refer 
to itself 

S I know the Epimenides and the Liar who says What I am now saying is untrue and nothing 
else and I find the solution you just mentioned attractive 

Th But it does not solve the paradox if you admit as you did that indirect selfreference is 
admissible For as Langford has shown the Liar or the Epimenides can be formulated by using 
indirect selfreference instead of direct selfreference 

S Please give me this formulation at once 

Th The next assertion I am going to make is a true one 

S Dont you always speak the truth 

Th The last assertion I made was untrue 

S So you wish to withdraw it All right you may begin again 

Th You dont seem to realize what my two assertions taken together amounted to 

S Oh now I see the implications of what you were saying You are quite right It is old Epimenides 
all over again 

Th I have used indirect selfreference instead of direct selfreference that is the only difference And 
this example establishes I believe that such paradoxes as the Epimenides cannot be solved by 
dwelling on the impossibility of selfreferring assertions For even if direct selfreference 

 

 

were impossible or meaningless indirect selfreference is certainly quite a common thing I may for 
example make the following comment I am confidently looking forward to a clever and appropriate 
remark from you Socrates 

S This expression of your confidence Theaetetus is highly flattering 

Th This shows how easily it may occur that a comment is a comment upon another one which in its turn is a 
comment upon the first But once we see that we cannot solve the paradoxes in this way we shall also see that even 
direct selfreference may be perfectly in order In fact many examples of nonparadoxical although directly self
referring assertions have been known for a long time both of selfreferring statements of a more or less empirical 
character and of selfreferring statements whose truth or falsity can be established by logical reasoning 

S Could you produce an example of a selfreferring assertion which is empirically true 

Th                 

S I could not hear what you were saying Theaetetus Please repeat it a little louder My hearing is no longer what it 
used to be 

Th I said I am now speaking so softly that dear old Socrates cannot make out what I am saying 

S I like this example and I cannot deny that when you were speaking so softly you were speaking truthfully Nor 
can I deny the empirical character of this truth for had my ears been younger it would have turned out an untruth 

Th The truth of my next assertion will be even logically demonstrable for example by a reductio ad absurdum 
a method most beloved of Euclid the Geometrician 

S I do not know him you dont mean the man from Megara I presume But I think I know what you mean by a 
reductio Will you now state your theorem 

Th What I am now saying is meaningful 

S If you dont mind I shall try to prove your theorem myself For the purpose of a reductio I begin with the 
assumption that your last utterance was meaningless This however turns out to contradict your utterance and thus 
to entail the falsity of your utterance But if an utterance is false then it must clearly be meaningful Thus my 
assumption is absurd which proves your theorem 

Th You have got it Socrates You have proved my theorem as you insist on calling it But some philosophers may 
not believe you They will say that my utterance or perhaps the one you disproved that is What I am now saying is 
meaningless was paradoxical and that since it is paradoxical you can prove whatever you like about itits truth as 
well as its falsity 

S I have shown that the assumption of the truth of the assertion What I 

 

 

am now saying is meaningless leads to an absurdity Let them show by a similar argument that the 
assumption of its falsity or of the truth of your theorem leads to an absurdity also When they 
succeed in this then they may claim its paradoxical character or if you like its meaninglessness and 
the meaninglessness of your theorem also 

Th I agree Socrates moreover I am perfectly satisfied that they will not succeedat least as long 
as by a meaningless utterance they mean something like an expression which is formulated in a 
manner which violates the rules of grammar or in other words a badly constructed expression 

S I am glad that you feel so sure Theaetetus but are you not just a little too sure of our case 

Th If you dont mind Ill postpone the answer to that question for a minute or two My reason is that I 
should like first to draw your attention to the fact that even if somebody did show that my theorem or 
perhaps its negation was paradoxical he would not thereby have succeeded in showing that it is to 
be described as meaningless in the best and most appropriate sense of the word For in order to 
succeed he would have to show that if we assume the truth of my theorem or the falsity of its 
negation What I am now saying is meaningless an absurdity follows But I should be inclined to 
argue that such a derivation cannot be attempted by anybody who does not understand the meaning 
of my theorem or of its negation And I should also be inclined to argue that if the meaning of an 
utterance can be understood then the utterance has a meaning and again that if it has any 
implications that is to say if anything follows from it it must also have a meaning This view at 
least seems to be in accordance with ordinary usage dont you think so 

S I do 

Th Of course I do not wish to say that there may not be other ways of using the word meaningful 
for example one of my fellowmathematicians has suggested that we call an assertion meaningful 
only if we possess a valid proof of it But this would have the consequence that we could not know of 
a conjecture such as GoldbachsEvery even number except  is the sum of two primeswhether it 
is at all meaningful before we have found a valid proof of it moreover even the discovery of a 
counter example would not disprove the conjecture but only confirm its lack of meaning 

S I think this would be both a strange way and an awkward way of using the word meaningful 

Th Other people have been a little more liberal They suggested that we should call an assertion 
meaningful if and only if there is a method which can either prove it or disprove it This would make 
a conjecture such as Goldbachs meaningful the moment we have found a counter example or a 
method of constructing one But as long as we have not 

 

 

found a method of proving or disproving it we cannot know whether or not it is meaningful 

S It does not seem right to me to denounce all conjectures or hypotheses as meaningless or 
nonsensical simply because we dont know yet how to prove them or disprove them 

Th Others again have suggested calling an assertion meaningful only if we know how to find out 
whether it is true or false a suggestion which amounts more or less to the same 

S It does look to me very similar to your previous suggestion 

Th If however we mean by a meaningful assertion or question something like an expression which 
is understandable by anybody knowing the language because it is formed in accordance with the 
grammatical rules for the formation of statements or questions in that language then I believe we 
can give a correct answer to my next question which again will be a selfreferring one 

S Let me see whether I can answer it 

Th Is the question I am now asking you meaningful or meaningless 

S It is meaningful and demonstrably so For assume my answer to be false and the answer It is 
meaningless to be true Then a true answer to your question can be given But a question to which 
an answer can be given and a true answer at that must be meaningful Therefore your question was 
meaningful quod erat demonstrandum 

Th I wonder where you picked up all this Latin Socrates Still I can find no flaw in your 
demonstration it is after all only a version of your proof of what you call my theorem 

S I think you have disposed of the suggestion that selfreferring assertions are always meaningless 
But I am sad at this admission for it seemed such a straightforward way of getting rid of the 
paradoxes 

Th You need not be sad there simply was no way out in this direction 

S Why not 

Th Some people seem to think that there is a way of solving the paradoxes by dividing our 
utterances or expressions into meaningful statements which in turn can be either true or false and 
utterances which are meaningless or nonsensical or not properly constructed or pseudostatements 
or indefinite propositions as some philosophers preferred to call them and which can be neither true 
nor false If they could only show that a paradoxical utterance falls into the third of these three 
exclusive and exhaustive classestrue false and meaninglessthen they believe the paradox in 
question would have found its solution 

S Precisely This was the way I had in mind though I was not so clear about it and I found it 
attractive 

 

Th But these people dont ask themselves whether it is at all possible to solve a paradox such as 
that of the liar on the basis of a classification into these three classes even if we could prove that it 
belongs to this third class of meaningless utterances 

 

S I dont follow you Assume they have succeeded in finding a proof which establishes that an 
utterance of the form U is false is meaningless whenever U is a name of this very utterance U is 
false Why should this not solve the paradox 

Th It would not It would only shift it For under the assumption that U is itself the utterance U is 
false I can disprove the hypothesis that U is meaningless with the help of precisely this threefold 
classification of utterances 

S If you are right then a proof of the hypothesis that U is meaningless would indeed only establish a 
new statement which can be proved as well as disproved and therefore a new paradox But how can 
you disprove the hypothesis that U is meaningless 

Th Again by a reductio Quite generally we can read off from our classification two rules i From 
the truth of X is meaningless we can derive the falsity of X is true and also what interests us here 
the falsity of X is false ii From the falsity of any utterance Y we can conclude that Y is meaningful 
According to these rules we find that from the truth of our hypothesis U is meaningless we can 
derive by i the falsity of U is false concluding by ii that U is false is meaningful But since U is 
false is nothing but U itself we have shown by ii again that U is meaningful which concludes the 
reductio Incidentally since the truth of our hypothesis entails the falsity of U is false it also entails 
our original paradox 

S This is a surprising result a Liar who comes back by the window just when you think you have 
got rid of him by the door Is there no way whatever of eliminating these paradoxes 

Th There is a very simple way Socrates 

S What is it 

Th Just avoid them as nearly everybody does and dont worry about them 

S But is this sufficient Is this safe 

Th For ordinary language and for ordinary purposes it seems sufficient and quite safe At any rate 
you can do nothing else in ordinary language since paradoxes can be constructed in it and are 
understandable as we have seen 

S But could we not legislate say that any kind of selfreference whether direct or indirect should be 
avoided and thereby purify our language of paradoxes  

 

Th We might try to do this although it might lead to new difficulties But a language for which we 
legislate in this way is no longer our ordinary language artificial rules make an artificial language Has 
not our discussion shown that at least indirect selfreference is quite an ordinary thing 

S But for mathematics say a somewhat artificial language would be appropriate would it not 

 

Th It would and for the construction of a language with artificial rules which if it is properly done 
might be called a formalized language we shall take hints from the fact that paradoxes which we 
wish to avoid can occur in ordinary language 

S And you would legislate for your formalized language I suppose that all selfreference must be 
strictly excluded would you not 

Th No We can avoid paradoxes without using such drastic measures 

S Do you call them drastic Th They are drastic because they would exclude some very interesting 
uses of selfreference especially Gdels method of constructing selfreferring statements a method 
which has most important applications in my own field of interest the theory of numbers They are 
drastic moreover because we have learned from Tarski that in any consistent languagelet us call it 
Lthe predicates true in L and false in L cannot occur as opposed to meaningful in L and 
meaningless in L which may occur and that without predicates such as these paradoxes of the 
type of the Epimenides or of Grellings paradox of the heterological adjectives cannot be 
formulated This hint turns out to be sufficient for the construction of formalized languages in which 
these paradoxes are avoided 

S Who are all these mathematicians Theodorus never mentioned their names 

Th Barbarians Socrates But they are very able Gdels method of arithmetization as it is called 
is especially interesting in the context of 
our present discussion 

S Another selfreference and quite an ordinary one I am getting a bit hypersensitive to these 
things 

Th Gdels method one might say is to translate certain nonarithmetical assertions into 
arithmetical ones they are turned into an arithmetical code as it were and among the assertions 
which can be so coded there happens to be also the one which you have jokingly described as my 
theorem To be a little more exact the assertion which can be turned into Gdels arithmetical code is 
the selfreferring statement This expression is a wellformed formula here wellformed formula 
replaces of course the word meaningful I felt you will remember a little too sure for your liking that 
my theorem cannot be disproved My reason was simply that when turned into the Gdelian code 

 

 

my theorem becomes a theorem of arithmetic It is demonstrable and its negation is refutable Now if 
anybody were to succeed by a valid argument perhaps by one similar to your own proof in 
disproving my theoremfor example by deriving an absurdity from the assumption that the negation 
of my theorem is falsethen this argument could be used to show the same of the corresponding 
arithmetical theorem and since this would at once provide us with a method of proving    I feel 
that I have good reasons for believing that my theorem cannot be disproved 

 

S Could you explain Gdels method of coding without getting involved in technicalities 

Th There is no need to do this since it has been done beforeI do not mean before now the 
supposed dramatic date of this little dialogue of ours which is about  BC but I mean before our 
dialogue will ever be concocted by its author which wont take place before another  years have 
elapsed 

S I am shocked Theaetetus by these latest selfreferences of yours You talk as if we were actors 
reciting the lines of a play This is a trick which I am afraid some playwrights think witty but hardly 
their victims anyway I dont But even worse than any such selfreferring joke is this preposterous 
nay this nonsensical chronology of yours Seriously I must draw a line somewhere Theaetetus and 
I am drawing it here 

Th Come Socrates who cares about chronology Ideas are timeless 

S Beware of metaphysics Theaetetus 

 

  
WHAT IS DIALECTIC 

There is nothing we can imagine however absurd or incredible that has not been maintained by one 
philosopher or another 

DESCARTES 

 DIALECTIC EXPLAINED 

THE above motto can be generalized It applies not only to philosophers and philosophy but throughout the realm of 
human thought and enterprise to science technology engineering and politics Indeed the tendency to try anything 

once suggested by the motto can be discerned in a still wider realmin the stupendous variety of forms and 
appearances which are produced by life on our planet 

Thus if we want to explain why human thought tends to try out every conceivable solution for any problem with which 
it is faced then we can appeal to a highly general sort of regularity The method by which a solution is approached is 
usually the same it is the method of trial and error This fundamentally is also the method used by living 
organisms in the process of adaptation It is clear that the success of this method depends very largely on the 
number and variety of the trials the more we try the more likely it is that one of our attempts will be successful 

We may describe the method employed in the development of human thought and especially of philosophy as a 
particular variant of the trial and error method Men seem inclined to react to a problem either by putting forward 
some theory and clinging to it as long as they can if it is erroneous they may even perish with it rather than give it up 
  or by fighting against such a theory once they have seen its weaknesses This struggle of ideologies 

 

 The dogmatic attitude of sticking to a theory as long as possible is of considerable significance Without it we 
could never find out what is in a theorywe should give the theory up before we had a real opportunity of finding 
out its strength and in consequence no theory would ever be able to play its role of bringing order into the world 
of preparing us for future events of drawing our attention to events we should otherwise never observe 

 

 

which is obviously explicable in terms of the method of trial and error seems to be characteristic of anything that may 
be called a development in human thought The cases in which it does not occur are in the main those in which a 
certain theory or system is dogmatically maintained throughout some long period but there will be few if any 
examples of a development of thought which is slow steady and continuous and proceeds by successive degrees 
of improvement rather than by trial and error and the struggle of ideologies 

If the method of trial and error is developed more and more consciously then it begins to take on the characteristic 
features of scientific method This method  can briefly be described as follows Faced with a certain problem the 
scientist offers tentatively some sort of solutiona theory This theory science accepts only provisionally if at all and 
it is most characteristic of the scientific method that scientists will spare no pains to criticize and test the theory in 
question Criticizing and testing go hand in hand the theory is criticized from very many different sides in order to 
bring out those points which may be vulnerable And the testing of the theory proceeds by exposing these vulnerable 
points to as severe an examination as possible This of course is again a variant of the method of trial and error 
Theories are put forward tentatively and tried out If the outcome of a test shows that the theory is erroneous then it 
is eliminated the method of trial and error is essentially a method of elimination Its success depends mainly on three 
conditions namely that sufficiently numerous and ingenious theories should be offered that the theories offered 
should be sufficiently varied and that sufficiently severe tests should be made In this way we may if we are lucky 
secure the survival of the fittest theory by elimination of those which are less fit 

If this description  of the development of human thought in general and of scientific thought in particular is accepted 
as more or less correct then it may help us to understand what is meant by those who say that the development of 
thought proceeds on dialectic lines 

Dialectic in the modern  sense ie especially in the sense in which Hegel used the term is a theory which 
maintains that somethingmore especially human thoughtdevelops in a way characterized by what is called the 
dialectic triad thesis antithesis and synthesis First there is some idea or theory or movement which may be 
called a thesis Such a thesis will often produce opposition because like most things in this world it will probably 

 

 It is not a method in the sense that if you practice it you will succeed or if you dont succeed you cant have 
practised it that is to say it is not a definite way to results a method in this sense does not exist 
 A more detailed discussion can be found in LScD 
 The Greek expression Hdialektik techn may be translated the art of the argumentative usage of 
language This meaning of the term goes back to Plato but even in Plato it occurs in a variety of different 
meanings One at least of its ancient meanings is very close to what I have described above as scientific 
method For it is used to describe the method of constructing explanatory theories and of the critical discussion of 
these theories which includes the question whether they are able to account for empirical observations or using 
the old terminology whether they are able to save the appearances 

 

 

be of limited value and will have its weak spots The opposing idea or movement is called the antithesis because 
it is directed against the first the thesis The struggle between the thesis and the antithesis goes on until some 
solution is reached which in a certain sense goes beyond both thesis and antithesis by recognizing their respective 
values and by trying to preserve the merits and to avoid the limitations of both This solution which is the third step is 
called the synthesis Once attained the synthesis in its turn may become the first step of a new dialectic triad and 
it will do so if the particular synthesis reached turns out to be onesided or otherwise unsatisfactory For in this case 
opposition will be aroused again which means that the synthesis can then be described as a new thesis which has 
produced a new antithesis The dialectic triad will thus proceed on a higher level and it may reach a third level 
when a second synthesis has been attained  

So much for what is called the dialectic triad It can hardly be doubted that the dialectic triad describes fairly well 
certain steps in the history of thought especially certain developments of ideas and theories and of social 
movements which are based on ideas or theories Such a dialectic development may be explained by showing that it 
proceeds in conformity with the method of trial and error which we have discussed above But it has to be admitted 
that it is not exactly the same as the development described above of a theory by trial and error Our earlier 
description of the trial and error method dealt only with an idea and its criticism or using the terminology of 
dialecticians with the struggle between a thesis and its antithesis originally we made no suggestions about a further 
development we did not imply that the struggle between a thesis and an antithesis would lead to a synthesis Rather 
we suggested that the struggle between an idea and its criticism or between a thesis and its antithesis would lead to 
the elimination of the thesis or perhaps of the antithesis if it is not satisfactory and that the competition of theories 
would lead to the adoption of new theories only if enough theories are at hand and are offered for trial 

Thus the interpretation in terms of the trial and error method may be said to be slightly wider than that in terms of 
dialectic It is not confined to a situation where only one thesis is offered to start with and so it can easily be applied 
to situations where from the very beginning a number of different theses are offered independently of one another 
and not only in such a way that the one is opposed to the other But admittedly it happens very frequently perhaps 

usually that the development of a certain branch of human thought starts with one single idea only If so then the 
dialectic scheme may often be applicable because this thesis will be open to criticism and in this way produce as 
dialecticians usually say its antithesis 

 

 In Hegels terminology both the thesis and the antithesis are by the synthesis  reduced to components 
of the synthesis and they are thereby  cancelled or negated or annulled or set aside or put 
away and at the same time  preserved or stored or saved or put away and  elevated or lifted 
to a higher level The italicized expressions are renderings of the four main meanings of the one German 
word aufgehoben literally lifted up of whose ambiguity Hegel makes much use 

 

 

The dialecticians emphasis involves still another point where dialectic may differ slightly from the general trial and 
error theory For the trial and error theory as suggested above will be content to say that an unsatisfactory view will 
be refuted or eliminated The dialectician insists that there is more to be said than this He emphasizes that although 
the view or theory under consideration may have been refuted there will most probably be an element in it which is 
worthy of preservation for otherwise it is not very likely that it would have been offered at all and taken seriously This 
valuable element of the thesis is likely to be brought out more clearly by those who defend the thesis against the 
attacks of their opponents the adherents of the antithesis Thus the only satisfactory solution of the struggle will be a 
synthesis ie a theory in which the best points of both thesis and antithesis are preserved 

It must be admitted that such a dialectical interpretation of the history of thought may sometimes be quite satisfactory 
and that it may add some valuable details to an interpretation in terms of trial and error 

Let us take the development of physics as an example We can find very many instances which fit the dialectic 
scheme such as the corpuscular theory of light which after first having been replaced by the wave theory remains 
preserved in the new theory which replaces them both To put it more precisely the old formulae can usually be 
described from the standpoint of the new ones as approximations that is to say they appear to be very nearly 
correct so that they can be applied either if we do not demand a very high degree of exactitude or even within 
certain limited fields of application as perfectly exact formulae 

All this can be said in favour of the dialectic point of view But we have to be careful not to admit too much 

We must be careful for instance about a number of metaphors used by dialecticians and unfortunately often taken 
much too seriously An example is the dialectical saying that the thesis produces its antithesis Actually it is only our 
critical attitude which produces the antithesis and where such an attitude is lackingwhich often enough is the case
no antithesis will be produced Similarly we have to be careful not to think that it is the struggle between a thesis 
and its antithesis which produces a synthesis The struggle is one of minds and these minds must be productive of 
new ideas there are many instances of futile struggles in the history of human thought struggles which ended in 
nothing And even when a synthesis has been reached it will usually be a rather crude description of the synthesis to 
say that it preserves the better parts of both the thesis and the antithesis This description will be misleading even 
where it is true because in addition to older ideas which it preserves the synthesis will in every case embody some 
new idea which cannot be reduced to earlier stages of the development In other words the synthesis will usually be 
much more than a construction out of material supplied by thesis and antithesis Considering all this the dialectic 

interpretation even where it may be applicable will hardly ever help to develop thought 

 

 

by its suggestion that a synthesis should be constructed out of the ideas contained in a thesis and an antithesis This 
is a point which some dialecticians have stressed themselves nevertheless they nearly always assume that dialectic 
can be used as a technique that will help them to promote or at least to predict the future development of thought 

But the most important misunderstandings and muddles arise out of the loose way in which dialecticians speak about 
contradictions 

They observe correctly that contradictions are of the greatest importance in the history of thoughtprecisely as 
important as is criticism For criticism invariably consists in pointing out some contradiction either a contradiction 
within the theory criticized or a contradiction between the theory and another theory which we have some reason to 
accept or a contradiction between the theory and certain factsor more precisely between the theory and certain 
statements of fact Criticism can never do anything except either point out some such contradiction or perhaps 
simply contradict the theory ie the criticism may be simply the statement of an antithesis But criticism is in a very 
important sense the main motive force of any intellectual development Without contradictions without criticism 
there would be no rational motive for changing our theories there would be no intellectual progress 

Having thus correctly observed that contradictionsespecially of course the contradiction between a thesis and an 
antithesis which produces progress in the form of a synthesisare extremely fertile and indeed the moving forces of 
any progress of thought dialecticians concludewrongly as we shall seethat there is no need to avoid these fertile 
contradictions And they even assert that contradictions cannot be avoided since they occur everywhere in the world 

Such an assertion amounts to an attack upon the socalled law of contradiction or more fully upon the law of the 
exclusion of contradictions of traditional logic a law which asserts that two contradictory statements can never be 
true together or that a statement consisting of the conjunction of two contradictory statements must always be 
rejected as false on purely logical grounds Appealing to the fruitfulness of contradictions dialecticians claim that this 
law of traditional logic must be discarded They claim that dialectic leads in this way to a new logica dialectical logic 
Dialectic which I have so far presented as a merely historical doctrinea theory of the historical development of 
thoughtwould turn out in this way to be a very different doctrine it would be at the same time a logical theory and 
as we shall see a general theory of the world 

These are tremendous claims but they are without the slightest foundation Indeed they are based on nothing better 
than a loose and woolly way of speaking 

Dialecticians say that contradictions are fruitful or fertile or productive of progress and we have admitted that this is 
in a sense true It is true however only so long as we are determined not to put up with contradictions and to 
change any theory which involves contradictions in other words never 

 

to accept a contradiction it is solely due to this determination of ours that criticism ie the pointing out of 
contradictions induces us to change our theories and thereby to progress 

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that if we change this attitude and decide to put up with contradictions then 
contradictions must at once lose any kind of fertility They would no longer be productive of intellectual progress For 
if we were prepared to put up with contradictions pointing out contradictions in our theories could no longer induce us 
to change them In other words all criticism which consists in pointing out contradictions would lose its force 
Criticism would be answered by And why not or perhaps even by an enthusiastic There you are that is by 
welcoming the contradictions which have been pointed out to us 

But this means that if we are prepared to put up with contradictions criticism and with it all intellectual progress must 
come to an end 

Thus we must tell the dialectician that he cannot have it both ways Either he is interested in contradictions because 
of their fertility then he must not accept them Or he is prepared to accept them then they will be barren and rational 
criticism discussion and intellectual progress will be impossible 

The only force which propels the dialectic development is therefore our determination not to accept or to put up 
with the contradiction between the thesis and the antithesis It is not a mysterious force inside these two ideas not a 
mysterious tension between them which promotes developmentit is purely our decision our resolution not to admit 
contradictions which induces us to look out for a new point of view which may enable us to avoid them And this 
resolution is entirely justified For it can easily be shown that if one were to accept contradictions then one would 
have to give up any kind of scientific activity it would mean a complete breakdown of science This can be shown by 
proving that if two contradictory statements are admitted any statement whatever must be 
admitted for from a couple of contradictory statements any statement whatever can be validly inferred 

This is not always realized  and will therefore be fully explained here It is one of the few facts of elementary logic 
which are not quite trivial and deserve to be known and understood by every thinking man It can easily be explained 
to those readers who do not dislike the use of symbols which look like mathematics but even those who dislike such 
symbols should understand the matter easily if they are not too impatient and prepared to devote a few minutes to 
this point 

Logical inference proceeds according to certain rules of inference It is valid if the rule of inference to which it 
appeals is valid and a rule of inference 

 

 See for example H Jeffreys The Nature of Mathematics Philosophy of Science    who 
writes Whether a contradiction entails any proposition is doubtful See also Jeffreys reply to me in Mind  
 p  and my rejoinder in Mind   pp  ff The considerations which follow here were known in 
effect to Duns Scotus ob  as has been shown by Jan Lukasiewicz in Erkenntnis  p  

 

 

 

is valid if and only if it can never lead from true premises to a false conclusion or in other words if 
it unfailingly transmits the truth of the premises provided they are all true to the conclusion 

We shall need two such rules of inference In order to explain the first and more difficult one we introduce the idea of 
a compound statement that is to say of a statement such as  Socrates is wise and Peter is a King or perhaps 
Either Socrates is wise or Peter is a King but not both or perhaps  Socrates is wise andor Peter is a King The 
two statements  Socrates is wise and  Peter is a king of which such a compound statement is composed are 
called component statements 

Now there is one kind of compound statement which interests us herethe one which is so constructed that it is true 
if and only if at least one of its two components is true The ugly expression andor has precisely the 
effect of producing such a compound the assertion  Socrates is wise andor Peter is a King is one which will be 
true if and only if one or both of its component statements are true and it will be false if and only if both of its 
component statements are false 

It is customary in logic to replace the expression andor by the symbol v  to be pronounced vel and to use such 
letters as p and q to represent any statement we like We can then say that a statement of the form pv q will be 
true if one at least of its two components p and q is true 

We are now in a position to formulate our first rule of inference It may be formulated in this way 

 From a premise p for example  Socrates is wise any conclusion of the form pv q for example  Socrates is 
wise v Peter is a King may be validly deduced 

That this rule must be valid can be seen at once if we remember the meaning of v This symbol makes a compound 
which is true whenever at least one of the components is true Accordingly if p is true pv q must also be true Thus 
our rule can never lead from a true premise to a false conclusion which means that it is valid 

In spite of its validity our first rule of inference often strikes those who are not used to such things as strange And it 
is indeed a rule which is rarely used in everyday life since the conclusion contains much less information than the 
premise But it is sometimes used for example in betting I may say toss a penny twice betting that heads will turn 
up at least once This obviously is tantamount to my betting on the truth of the compound statement Heads turn 
up at the first toss v heads turn up at the second toss The probability of this statement equals  according to 
usual calculations it is thus different for example from the statement Heads turn up at the first toss or heads turn 
up at the second toss but not both whose probability is  Now everybody will say that I have won my bet if heads 
turned up at the first tossin other words that the compound statement on whose truth I was betting must be true if 
its first component was true which shows that we argued in accordance with our first rule of inference 

 

 

We can also state our first rule in this way 

 

which may be read from the premise p we obtain the conclusion pv qThe second rule of inference which I am 
going to use is more familiar than the first If we denote the negation of p by nonp then it can be stated in this way 

 

which may be put in words From the two premises nonp and pv q we obtain the conclusion qThe validity of 
this rule can be established if we consider that nonp is a statement which is true if and only if p is false Accordingly 
if the first premise nonp is true then the first component of the second premise is false thus if both premises are 
true the second component of the second premise must be true that is to say q must be true whenever the two 
premises are trueIn reasoning that if nonp is true p must be false we have made implicit use it may be said of 
the law of contradiction which asserts that nonp and p cannot be true together Thus if it were my task at this 
moment to argue in favour of contradiction we should have to be more cautious But at this moment I am only trying 
to show that using valid rules of inference we can infer from a couple of contradictory premises 
any conclusion we likeUsing our two rules we can indeed show this For assume we have the two contradictory 
premisessay 
A 
B 
From these two premises any statementfor example  Caesar was a traitor can be inferred as followsFrom the first 
premise a we can infer in accordance with rule  the following conclusion 

The sun is shining now 
The sun is not shining now 

The sun is shining now v Caesar was a traitor 

Taking now b and c as premises we can ultimately deduce in accordance with rule  

Caesar was a traitor 

It is clear that by the same method we might have inferred any other statement we wanted to infer for example  
Caesar was not a traitor We may thus infer      and     not only every statement we like but also its 
negation which we may not like 

We see from this that if a theory contains a contradiction then it entails everything and therefore indeed nothing A 
theory which adds to every information which it asserts also the negation of this information can give us no 
information at all A theory which involves a contradiction is therefore entirely useless as a theory 

 

 

In view of the importance of the logical situation analysed I shall now present some other rules of inference which 
lead to the same result In contradistinction to rule  the rules now to be examined and to be used form part of the 
classical theory of the syllogism with the exception of the following rule  which we shall discuss first 

 From any two premises p and q we may derive a conclusion which is identical with one of themsay p or 
schematically 

 

In spite of its unfamiliarity and of the fact that some philosophers  have not accepted it this rule is undoubtedly 
valid for it must infallibly lead to true conclusion whenever the premises are true This is obvious and indeed trivial 
and it is this very triviality which makes the rule in ordinary discourse redundant and therefore unfamiliar But 
redundancy does not mean invalidity 

In addition to this rule  we shall need another rule which I have called the rule of indirect reduction because in the 
classical theory of the syllogism it is implicitly used for the indirect reduction of the imperfect figure to the first or 
perfect figure 

Assume we have a valid syllogism such as 

a 
b 
c 

All men are mortal 
All Athenians are men 
All Athenians are mortal 

Now the rule of indirect reduction says 

For example owing to the validity of the inference of c from the premises a and b we find that 

 

must also be valid 

 

The rule we are going to use as a slight variant of the one just stated it is this 

Rule  may be obtained for example from the rule  together with the law of double negation which tells us that 
from nonnon b we may deduce b Now 

 

 
 Notably G E Moore 

 

 

if rule  is valid for any statement a b c which we choose and only then is it valid then it must also be valid in 
case c happens to be identical with a that is to say the following must be valid 

 

 

But  states exactly what we wanted to showthat from a couple of contradictory premises any conclusion may be 
deduced 

 

 

The question may be raised whether this situation holds good in any system of logic or whether we can construct a 
system of logic in which contradictory statements do not entail every statement I have gone into this question and 
the answer is that such a system can be constructed The system turns out however to be an extremely weak 
system Very few of the ordinary rules of inference are left not even the modus ponens which says that from a 
statement of the form If p then q together with p we can infer q In my opinion such a system  is of no use for 
drawing inferences although it may perhaps have some interest for those who are specially interested in the 
construction of formal systems as such 

It has sometimes been said that the fact that from a couple of contradictory statements anything we wish follows does 
not establish the uselessness of a contradictory theory first this theory may be interesting in itself even though 
contradictory secondly it may give rise to corrections which make it consistent and ultimately we may develop a 
method even if it is an ad hoc method such as in Quantum Theory the methods of avoiding the divergencies
which prevents us from obtaining the false conclusions which admittedly are logically entailed by the theory All this is 
quite true but such a makeshift theory gives rise to the grave dangers previously discussed if we seriously intend to 
put up with it then nothing will make us search for a better theory and also the other way round if we look for a better 
theory then we do so because we think the theory we have described is a bad one owing to the 

 

 The system alluded to is the dualintuitionist calculus see my paper On the Theory of Deduction I and II 
Proc of the Royal Dutch Academy  Nos  and    on p  and  on p  and  
 and note  Dr Joseph Kalman Cohen has developed the system in some detail I have a simple 
interpretation of this calculus All the statements may be taken to be modal statements asserting possibility From 
p is possible and if p then q is possible we cannot indeed derive q is possible for if p is false q may be an 
impossible statement Similarly from p is possible and nonp is possible we clearly cannot deduce the 
possibility of all statements 

 

 

contradictions involved The acceptance of contradictions must lead here as everywhere to the end of criticism 
and thus to the collapse of science 

One sees here the danger of loose and metaphorical ways of speaking The looseness of the dialecticians assertion 
that contradictions are not avoidable and that it is not even desirable to avoid them because they are so fertile is 
dangerously misleading It is misleading because what may be called the fertility of the contradictions is as we have 
seen merely the result of our decision not to put up with them an attitude which accords with the law of 
contradiction And it is dangerous because to say that the contradictions need not be avoided or perhaps even that 
they cannot be avoided must lead to the breakdown of science and of criticism ie of rationality This should 
emphasize that for anyone who wants to promote truth and enlightenment it is a necessity and even a duty to train 
himself in the art of expressing things clearly and unambiguouslyeven if this means giving up certain niceties of 
metaphor and clever double meanings 

Therefore it is better to avoid certain formulations For instance instead of the terminology we have used in speaking 
of thesis antithesis and synthesis dialecticians often describe the dialectic triad by using the term negation of the 
thesis instead of antithesis and negation of the negation instead of synthesis And they like to use the term 
contradiction where terms like conflict or perhaps opposing tendency or opposing interest etc would be less 
misleading Their terminology would do no harm if the terms negation and negation of the negation and similarly 
the term contradiction had not clear and fairly definite logical meanings different from the dialectical usage In fact 
the misuse of these terms has contributed considerably to the confusion of logic and dialectic which so often occurs 
in the discussions of the dialecticians Frequently they consider dialectic to be a partthe better part of logic or 
something like a reformed modernized logic The deeper reasons for such an attitude will be discussed later At 
present I shall only say that our analysis does not lead to the conclusion that dialectic has any sort of similarity to 
logic For logic can be describedroughly perhaps but well enough for our present purposesas a theory of 
deduction We have no reason to believe that dialectic has anything to do with deduction 

To sum up What dialectic isdialectic in the sense in which we can attach a clear meaning to the dialectic triadcan 
be described thus Dialectic or more precisely the theory of the dialectic triad maintains that certain developments 
or certain historical processes occur in a certain typical way It is therefore an empirical descriptive theory 
comparable for instance with the theory which maintains that most living organisms increase their size during some 
stage of their development then remain constant and finally decrease until they die or with the theory which 
maintains that opinions are held first dogmatically then sceptically and only afterwards in a third stage in a 
scientific ie critical spirit Like such theories dialectic is not applicable without exceptionsunless we force the 
dialectic interpretationsand like such theories dialectic has no special affinity to logic 

 

The vagueness of dialectic is another of its dangers It makes it only too easy to force a dialectic interpretation on all 
sorts of developments and even on quite different things We find for instance a dialectic interpretation which 
identifies a seed of corn with a thesis the plant which develops from this seed with the antithesis and all the seeds 
which develop from this plant with the synthesis That such an application expands the already too vague meaning of 
the dialectic triad in a way which dangerously increases its vagueness is obvious it leads to a point where by 
describing a development as dialectic we convey no more than by saying that it is a development in stages which is 
not saying very much But to interpret this development by saying that germination of the plant is the negation of the 
seed because the seed ceases to exist when the plant begins to grow and that the production of a lot of new seeds 
by the plant is the negation of the negationa new start on a higher levelis obviously a mere playing with words Is 
this the reason why Engels said of this example that any child can understand it 

The standard examples presented by dialecticians from the field of mathematics are even worse To quote a famous 
example used by Engels in the brief form given to it by Hecker  The law of the higher synthesis    is commonly 
used in mathematics The negative a multiplied by itself becomes a ie the negation of the negation has 
accomplished a new synthesis But even assuming a to be a thesis and a its antithesis or negation one might 
expect that the negation of the negation is  a ie a which would not be a higher synthesis but identical with the 
original thesis itself In other words why should the synthesis be obtained just by multiplying the antithesis with itself 
Why not for example by adding thesis and antithesis which would yield O Or by multiplying thesis and antithesis 
which would yield a rather than a and in what sense is a higher than a or a Certainly not in the sense of 
being numerically greater since if a   then a   The example shows the extreme arbitrariness with which 
the vague ideas of dialectic are applied 

A theory like logic may be called fundamental thereby indicating that since it is the theory of all sorts of inferences 
it is used all the time by all sciences We can say that dialectic in the sense in which we found that we could make a 
sensible application of it is not a fundamental but merely a descriptive theory It is therefore about as inappropriate to 
regard dialectic as part and parcel of logic or else as opposed to logic as it would be so to regard say the theory of 
evolution Only the loose metaphorical and ambiguous way of speaking which we have criticized above could make it 
appear that dialectic can be both a theory describing certain typical developments and a fundamental theory such as 
logic 

From all this I think it is clear that one should be very careful in using the term dialectic It would be best perhaps 
not to use it at allwe can always use the clearer terminology of the method of trial and error Exceptions should be 
made only where no misunderstanding is possible and where we

are faced with a development of theories which does in fact proceed along the lines of a triad 

 HEGELIAN DIALECTIC 

So far I have tried to outline the idea of dialectic in a way which I hope makes it intelligible and it was my aim not to 
be unjust about its merits In this outline dialectic was presented as a way of describing developments as one way 
among others not fundamentally important but sometimes quite suitable As opposed to this a theory of dialectic 
has been put forward for example by Hegel and his school which exaggerates its significance and which is 
dangerously misleading 

In order to make Hegels dialectic intelligible it may be useful to refer briefly to a chapter in the history of philosophy
in my opinion not a very creditable one 

A major issue in the history of modern philosophy is the struggle between Cartesian rationalism mainly continental 
on the one hand and empiricism mainly British on the other The sentence from Descartes which I have used as a 
motto for this paper was not intended by its author the founder of the rationalist school in the way in which I have 
made use of it It was not intended as a hint that the human mind has to try everything in order to arrive at something
ie at some useful solutionbut rather as a hostile criticism of those who dare to try out such absurdities What 
Descartes had in mind the main idea behind his sentence is that the real philosopher should carefully avoid absurd 
and foolish ideas In order to find truth he has only to accept those rare ideas which appeal to reason by their lucidity 
by their clarity and distinctness which are in short selfevident The Cartesian view is that we can construct the 
explanatory theories of science without any reference to experience just by making use of our reason for every 
reasonable proposition ie one recommending itself by its lucidity must be a true description of the facts This in 
brief outline is the theory which the history of philosophy has called rationalism A better name would be 
intellectualism It can be summed up using a formulation of a much later period namely that of Hegel in the 
words That which is reasonable must be real 

Opposed to this theory empiricism maintains that only experience enables us to decide upon the truth or falsity of a 
scientific theory Pure reasoning alone according to empiricism can never establish factual truth we have to make 
use of observation and experiment It can safely be said that empiricism in some form or other although perhaps in a 
modest and modified form is the only interpretation of scientific method which can be taken seriously in our day The 
struggle between the earlier rationalists and empiricists was thoroughly discussed by Kant who tried to offer what a 
dialectician but not Kant might describe as a synthesis of the two opposing views but what was more precisely a 
modified form of empiricism His main interest was to reject pure rationalism In his Critique of Pure Reason he 
asserted that the scope of our knowledge is limited to the field of possible experience and that 

 

 

speculative reasoning beyond this fieldthe attempt to build up a metaphysical system out of pure reasonhas no 
justification whatever This criticism of pure reason was felt as a terrible blow to the hopes of nearly all continental 
philosophers yet German philosophers recovered and far from being convinced by Kants rejection of metaphysics 
hastened to build up new metaphysical systems based on intellectual intuition They tried to use certain features 
of Kants system hoping thereby to evade the main force of his criticism The school which developed usually called 
the school of the German idealists culminated in Hegel 

There are two aspects of Hegels philosophy which we have to discusshis idealism and his dialectic In both cases 
Hegel was influenced by some of Kants ideas but tried to go further In order to understand Hegel we must therefore 
show how his theory made use of Kants 

Kant started from the fact that science exists He wanted to explain this fact that is he wanted to answer the 
question How is science possible or How are human minds able to gain knowledge of the world or How can our 
minds grasp the world We might call this question the epistemological problem 

His reasoning was somewhat as follows The mind can grasp the world or rather the world as it appears to us 
because this world is not utterly different from the mindbecause it is mindlike And it is so because in the process 
of obtaining knowledge of grasping the world the mind is so to speak actively digesting all that material which 
enters it by the senses It is forming moulding this material it impresses on it its own intrinsic forms or lawsthe 
forms or laws of our thought What we call naturethe world in which we live the world as it appears to usis 
already a world digested a world formed by our minds And being thus assimilated by the mind it is mindlike 

The answer The mind can grasp the world because the world as it appears to us is mindlike is an idealistic 
argument for what idealism asserts is just that the world has something of the character of mind 

I do not intend to argue here for or against this Kantian epistemology and I do not intend to discuss it in detail But I 
want to point out that it certainly is not entirely idealistic It is as Kant himself points out a mixture or a synthesis of 
some sort of realism and some sort of idealismits realist element being the assertion that the world as it appears to 
us is some sort of material formed by our mind whilst its idealist element is the assertion that it is some sort of 
material formed by our mind 

So much for Kants rather abstract but certainly ingenious epistemology Before I proceed to Hegel I must beg those 
readers I like them best who are not philosophers and who are used to relying on their common sense to bear in 
mind the sentence which I chose as a motto for this paper for what they will hear now will probably appear to them
in my opinion quite rightly absurd 

As I have said Hegel in his idealism went further than Kant Hegel too was concerned with the epistemological 
question How can our minds grasp 

 

 

the world With the other idealists he answered Because the world is mindlike But his theory was more radical 
than Kants He did not say like Kant Because the mind digests or forms the world He said Because the mind is 
the world or in another formulation Because the reasonable is the real because reality and reason are identical 

This is Hegels socalled philosophy of the identity of reason and reality or for short his philosophy of identity It 
may be noted in passing that between Kants epistemological answers Because the mind forms the world and 
Hegels philosophy of identity Because the mind is the world there was historically a bridgenamely Fichtes 
answer Because the mind creates the world  

Hegels philosophy of identity That which is reasonable is real and that which is real is reasonable thus reason and 
reality are identical was undoubtedly an attempt to reestablish rationalism on a new basis It permitted the 
philosopher to construct a theory of the world out of pure reasoning and to maintain that this must be a true theory of 
the real world Thus it allowed exactly what Kant had said to be impossible Hegel therefore was bound to try to 
refute Kants arguments against metaphysics He did this with the help of his dialectic 

To understand his dialectic we have to go back to Kant again To avoid too much detail I shall not discuss the triadic 
construction of Kants table of categories although no doubt it inspired Hegel  But I have to refer to Kants method 
of rejecting rationalism I mentioned above that Kant maintained that the scope of our knowledge is limited to the field 
of possible experience and that pure reasoning beyond this field is not justified In a section of the Critique which he 
headed Transcendental Dialectic he showed this as follows If we try to construct a theoretical system out of pure 
reasonfor instance if we try to argue that the world in which we live is infinite an idea which obviously goes beyond 
possible experiencethen we can do so but we shall find to our dismay that we can always argue with the help of 
analogous arguments to the opposite effect as well In other words given such a metaphysical thesis we could 
always construct and defend an exact antithesis and for any argument which supports the thesis we can easily 
construct its opposite argument in favour of the antithesis And both arguments will carry with them a similar force 
and convictionboth arguments will appear to be equally or almost equally reasonable Thus Kant said reason is 
bound to argue against itself and to contradict itself if used to go beyond possible experience 

If I were to give some sort of modernized reconstruction or reinterpretation of Kant deviating from Kants own view 
of what he had done I should say that Kant showed that the metaphysical principle of reasonableness or 

 
 This answer was not even original because Kant had considered it previously but he of course rejected it 
 MacTaggart has made this point the centre of his interesting Studies in Hegelian Dialectic 

 

 

selfevidence does not lead unambiguously to one and only one result or theory It is always possible to argue with 
similar apparent reasonableness in favour of a number of different theories and even of opposite theories Thus if 
we get no help from experience if we cannot make experiments or observations which at least tell us to eliminate 
certain theoriesnamely those which although they may seem quite reasonable are contrary to the observed facts 
then we have no hope of ever settling the claims of competing theories 

How did Hegel overcome Kants refutation of rationalism Very easily by holding that contradictions do not matter 
They just have to occur in the development of thought and reason They only show the insufficiency of a theory which 
does not take account of the fact that thought that is reason and with it according to the philosophy of identity 
reality is not something fixed once and for all but is developingthat we live in a world of evolution Kant so says 
Hegel refuted metaphysics but not rationalism For what Hegel calls metaphysics as opposed to dialectic is only 
such a rationalistic system as does not take account of evolution motion development and thus tries to conceive of 
reality as something stable unmoved and free of contradictions Hegel with his philosophy of identity infers that 
since reason develops the world must develop and since the development of thought or reason is a dialectic one 
the world must also develop in dialectic triads 

Thus we find the following three elements in Hegels dialectic 

a An attempt to evade Kants refutation of what Kant called dogmatism in metaphysics This refutation is 
considered by Hegel to hold only for systems which are metaphysical in his more narrow sense but not for dialectical 
rationalism which takes account of the development of reason and is therefore not afraid of contradictions In 
evading Kants criticism in this way Hegel embarks on an extremely dangerous venture which must lead to disaster 
for he argues something like this  Kant refuted rationalism by saying that it must lead to contradictions I admit that 
But it is clear that this argument draws its force from the law of contradiction it refutes only such systems as accept 
this law ie such as try to be free from contradictions It is not dangerous for a system like mine which is prepared to 
put up with contradictionsthat is for a dialectic system It is clear that this argument establishes a dogmatism of an 
extremely dangerous kinda dogmatism which need no longer be afraid of any sort of attack For any attack any 
criticism of any theory whatsoever must be based on the method of pointing out some sort of contradiction either 
within the theory itself or between the theory and some facts as I said above Hegels method of superseding Kant 
therefore is effective but unfortunately too effective It makes his system secure against any sort of criticism or 
attack and thus it is dogmatic in a very peculiar sense so that I should like to call it a reinforced dogmatism It may 
be remarked that similar reinforced dogmatisms help to support the structures of other dogmatic systems as well 

b The description of the development of reason in terms of dialectic is an element in Hegels philosophy which had 
a good deal of plausibility This 

 

 

becomes clear if we remember that Hegel uses the word reason not only in the subjective sense to denote a certain 
mental capacity but also in the objective sense to denote all sorts of theories thoughts ideas and so on Hegel who 
holds that philosophy is the highest expression of reasoning has in mind mainly the development of philosophical 
thought when he speaks of the development of reasoning And indeed hardly anywhere can the dialectic triad be 
more successfully applied than in the study of the development of philosophical theories and it is therefore not 
surprising that Hegels most successful attempt at applying his dialectic method was his History of Philosophy 

In order to understand the danger connected with such a success we have to remember that in Hegels timeand 
even much laterlogic was usually described and defined as the theory of reasoning or the theory of thinking and 
accordingly the fundamental laws of logic were usually called the laws of thought It is therefore quite 
understandable that Hegel believing that dialectic is the true description of our actual procedure when reasoning and 
thinking held that he must alter logic so as to make dialectic an important if not the most important part of logical 
theory This made it necessary to discard the law of contradiction which clearly was a grave obstacle to the 
acceptance of dialectic Here we have the origin of the view that dialectic is fundamental in the sense that it can 
compete with logic that it is an improvement upon logic I have already criticized this view of dialectic and I only want 
to repeat that any sort of logical reasoning whether before or after Hegel and whether in science or in mathematics 
or in any truly rational philosophy is always based on the law of contradiction But Hegel writes Logic Section  
 It is of the highest importance to ascertain and understand rightly the nature of Dialectic Wherever there is 
movement wherever there is life wherever anything is carried into effect in the actual world there Dialectic is at 
work It is also the soul of all knowledge which is truly scientific 

But if by dialectic reasoning Hegel means a reasoning which discards the law of contradiction then he certainly would 
not be able to give any instance of such reasoning in science The many instances quoted by dialecticians are 
without exception on the level of Engels examples referred to abovethe grain and a  aor even worse It is 
not scientific reasoning itself which is based on dialectic it is only the history and development of scientific theories 
which can with some success be described in terms of the dialectic method As we have seen this fact cannot justify 
the acceptance of dialectic as something fundamental because it can be explained without leaving the realm of 
ordinary logic if we remember the working of the trial and error method 

The main danger of such a confusion of dialectic and logic is as I said that it helps people to argue dogmatically For 
we find only too often that dialecticians when in logical difficulties as a last resort tell their opponents that their 
criticism is mistaken because it is based on logic of the ordinary type 

 

 

instead of on dialectic if they would only use dialectic they would see that the contradictions which they have found 
in some arguments of the dialecticians are quite legitimate namely from the dialectic point of view 

c A third element in Hegelian dialectic is based on his philosophy of identity If reason and reality are identical and 
reason develops dialectically as is so well exemplified by the development of philosophical thought then reality must 
develop dialectically too The world must be ruled by the laws of dialectical logic This standpoint has been called 
panlogism Thus we must find in the world the same contradictions as are permitted by dialectic logic It is this very 
fact that the world is full of contradictions which shows us from another angle that the law of contradiction has to be 
discarded For this law says that no selfcontradictory proposition or no pair of contradictory propositions can be 
true that is can correspond to the facts In other words the law implies that a contradiction can never occur in 
nature ie in the world of facts and that facts can never contradict each other But on the basis of the philosophy of 
the identity of reason and reality it is asserted that facts can contradict each other since ideas can contradict each 
other and that facts develop through contradictions just as ideas do so that the law of contradiction has to be 
abandoned 

But apart from what appears to me to be the utter absurdity of the philosophy of identity about which I shall say 
something later if we look a little closer into these socalled contradictory facts then we find that all the examples 
proffered by dialecticians just state that the world in which we live shows sometimes a certain structure which could 
perhaps be described with the help of the word polarity An instance of that structure would be the existence of 
positive and negative electricity It is only a metaphorical and loose way of speaking to say for instance that positive 
and negative electricity are contradictory to each other An example of a true contradiction would be two sentences 
This body here was on the st of November  between  and  am positively charged and an analogous 
sentence about the same body saying that it was at the same time not positively charged 

This would be a contradiction between two sentences and the corresponding contradictory fact would be the fact that 
a body is as a whole at the same time both positively and not positively charged and thus at the same time both 
attracts and does not attract certain negatively charged bodies But we need not say that such contradictory facts do 
not exist A deeper analysis might show that the nonexistence of such facts is not a law which is akin to laws of 
physics but is based on logic that is on the rules governing the use of scientific language 

So there are three points a the dialectic opposition to Kants antirationalism and consequently the reestablishment 
of rationalism supported by a reinforced dogmatism b the incorporation of dialectic in logic grounded on the 
ambiguity of expressions like reason laws of thought and so on c the application of dialectic to the whole world 
based on Hegels panlogism and his philosophy of identity These three points seem to me to be the 

 

 

main elements within Hegelian dialectic Before I proceed to outline the fate of dialectic after Hegel I should like to 
express my personal opinion about Hegels philosophy and especially about his philosophy of identity I think it 
represents the worst of all those absurd and incredible philosophic theories to which Descartes refers in the sentence 
which I have chosen as the motto for this paper It is not only that philosophy of identity is offered without any sort of 
serious argument even the problem which it has been invented to answerthe question How can our minds grasp 
the worldseems to me not to be at all clearly formulated And the idealist answer which has been varied by 
different idealist philosophers but remains fundamentally the same namely Because the world is mindlike has only 
the appearance of an answer We shall see clearly that it is not a real answer if we only consider some analogous 
argument like How can this mirror reflect my faceBecause it is facelike Although this sort of argument is 
obviously utterly unsound it has been formulated again and again We find it formulated by Jeans for instance in our 
own time along lines like these How can mathematics grasp the worldBecause the world is mathematicslike 
He argues thus that reality is of the very nature of mathematicsthat the world is a mathematical thought and 
therefore ideal This argument is obviously no sounder than the following How can language describe the 
worldBecause the world is languagelikeit is linguistic and no sounder than How can the English language 
describe the worldBecause the world is intrinsically British That this latter argument really is analogous to the 
one advanced by Jeans is easily seen if we recognize that the mathematical description of the world is just a certain 
way of describing the world and nothing else and that mathematics supplies us with the means of descriptionwith a 
particularly rich language 

Perhaps one can show this most easily with the help of a trivial example There are primitive languages which do not 
employ numbers but try to express numerical ideas with the help of expressions for one two and many It is clear 
that such a language is unable to describe some of the more complicated relationships between certain groups of 
objects which can easily be described with the help of the numerical expressions three four five and so on It can 
say that A has many sheep and more than B but it cannot say that A has  sheep and  more than B In other 
words mathematical symbols are introduced into a language in order to describe certain more complicated 
relationships which could not be described otherwise a language which contains the arithmetic of natural numbers is 
simply richer than a language which lacks the appropriate symbols All that we can infer about the nature of the world 
from the fact that we have to use mathematical language if we want to describe it is that the world has a certain 
degree of complexity so that there are certain relationships in it which cannot be described with the help of too 
primitive instruments of description 

Jeans was uneasy about the fact that our world happens to suit mathematical formulae originally invented by pure 
mathematicians who did not intend 

 

 

at all to apply their formulae to the world Apparently he originally started off as what I should call an inductivist that 
is he thought that theories are obtained from experience by some more or less simple procedure of inference If one 
starts from such a position it obviously is astonishing to find that a theory which has been formulated by pure 
mathematicians in a purely speculative manner afterwards proves to be applicable to the physical world But for 
those who are not inductivists this is not astonishing at all They know that it happens quite often that a theory put 
forward originally as a pure speculation as a mere possibility later proves to have its empirical applications They 
know that often it is this speculative anticipation which prepares the way for the empirical theories In this way the 
problem of induction as it is called has a bearing on the problem of idealism with which we are concerned here 

 DIALECTIC AFTER HEGEL 

Hegels philosophy of the identity of reason and reality is sometimes characterized as absolute idealism because it 
states that reality is mindlike or of the character of reason But clearly such a dialectical philosophy of identity can 
easily be turned round so as to become a kind of materialism Its holders would then argue that reality is in fact of a 
material or physical character as the ordinary man thinks it is and by saying that it is identical with reason or mind 
one would imply that the mind is also a material or physical phenomenonor to be less radical that if the mind 
should be somewhat different from it then the difference cannot be of great importance 

This materialism can be considered a revival of certain aspects of Cartesianism modified by links with dialectic But 
in discarding its original idealistic basis dialectic loses everything which made it plausible and understandable we 
have to remember that the best arguments in favour of dialectic lay in its applicability to the development of thought 
especially of philosophical thought Now we are faced blankly with the statement that physical reality develops 
dialecticallyan extremely dogmatic assertion with so little scientific support that materialistic dialecticians are forced 
to make a very extensive use of the dangerous method we have already described whereby criticism is rejected as 
nondialectical Dialectical materialism is thus in agreement with points a and b discussed above but it alters 
point c considerably although I think with no advantage to its dialectic features In expressing this opinion I want to 
stress the point that although I should not describe myself as a materialist my criticism is not directed against 
materialism which I personally should probably prefer to idealism if I were forced to choose which happily I am not 
It is only the combination of dialectic and materialism that appears to me to be even worse than dialectic idealism 

These remarks apply particularly to the Dialectical Materialism developed by Marx The materialistic element in this 
theory could be comparatively 

 

 

easily reformulated in such a way that no serious objections to it could be made As far as I can see the main point is 
this there is no reason to assume that whilst the natural sciences can proceed on the basis of the common mans 
realistic outlook the social sciences need an idealist background like the one offered by Hegelianism Such an 
assumption was often made in Marxs time owing to the fact that Hegel with his idealist theory of the State appeared 
strongly to influence and even to further the social sciences while the futility of views which he held within the field 
of the natural sciences wasat least for natural scientistsonly too obvious  I think it is a fair interpretation of the 
ideas of Marx and Engels to say that one of their chief interests in emphasizing materialism was to dismiss any theory 
which referring to the rational or spiritual nature of man maintains that sociology has to be based on an idealist or 
spiritualist basis or on the analysis of reason In opposition to this they stressed the fact that the material side of 
human natureand more particularly the need for food and other material goodsis of basic importance for sociology 

This view was undoubtedly sound and I hold Marxs contributions on this point to be of real significance and lasting 
influence Everyone learned from Marx that the development even of ideas cannot be fully understood if the history of 
ideas is treated although such a treatment may often have its great merits without mentioning the conditions of their 
origin and the situation of their originators among which conditions the economic aspect is highly significant 
Nevertheless I personally think that Marxs economism his emphasis on the economic background as the ultimate 
basis of any sort of developmentis mistaken and in fact untenable I think that social experience clearly shows that 
under certain circumstances the influence of ideas perhaps supported by propaganda can outweigh and supersede 
economic forces Besides granted that it is impossible fully to understand mental developments without 
understanding their economic background it is at least as impossible to understand economic developments without 
understanding the development of for instance scientific or religious ideas 

For our present purpose it is not so important to analyse Marxs materialism and economism as to see what has 
become of the dialectic within his system Two points seem to me important One is Marxs emphasis on 

 
 At least it should be obvious to everybody who considers as an instance the following surprising analysis of the 
essence of electricity which I have translated as well as I could even to the extent of trying to render it in a way 
which makes it perhaps slightly more understandable than Hegels original 

Electricity    is the purpose of the form from which it emancipates itself it is the form that is just about to 
overcome its own indifference for electricity is the immediate emergence or the actuality just emerging from the 
proximity of the form and still determined by itnot yet the dissolution however of the form itself but rather the 
more superficial process by which the differences desert the form which however they still retain as their 
condition having not yet grown into independence of and through them No doubt it ought to have been of and 
through it but I do not wish to suggest that this would have made much difference to the differences The 
passage is from Hegel Philosophy of Nature See also the two similar passages on Sound and on Heat 
quoted in my Open Society note  to ch  and text 

 

 

historical method in sociology a tendency which I have called historicism The other is the antidogmatic tendency of 
Marxs dialectic 

As for the first point we have to remember that Hegel was one of the inventors of the historical method a founder of 
the school of thinkers who believed that in describing a development historically one has causally explained it This 
school believed that one could for example explain certain social institutions by showing how mankind has slowly 
developed them Nowadays it is often recognized that the significance of the historical method for social theory has 
been much overrated but the belief in this method has by no means disappeared I have tried to criticize this method 
elsewhere especially in my book The Poverty of Historicism Here I merely want to stress that Marxs 
sociology adopted from Hegel not only the view that its method has to be historical and that sociology as well as 
history have to become theories of social development but also the view that this development has to be explained in 
dialectical terms To Hegel history was the history of ideas Marx dropped idealism but retained Hegels doctrine that 
the dynamic forces of historical development are the dialectical contradictions negations and negations of 
negations In this respect Marx and Engels followed Hegel very closely indeed as may be shown by the following 
quotations Hegel in his Encyclopaedia Part I ch VI p  described Dialectic as the universal and irresistible 
power before which nothing can stay however secure and stable it may deem itself Similarly Engels writes  Anti
Dhring Part I Dialectics Negation of the Negation What therefore is the negation of the negation An 
extremely general    law of development of Nature history and thought a law which    holds good in the animal 
and plant kingdom in geology in mathematics in history and in philosophy 

In Marxs view it is the main task of sociological science to show how these dialectic forces are working in history and 
thus to prophesy the course of history or as he says in the preface to Capital It is the ultimate aim of this work to 
lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society And this dialectic law of motion the negation of the negation 
furnishes the basis of Marxs prophecy of the impending end of capitalism  Capital I ch XXIV p  The capitalist 
mode of production    is the first negation    But capitalism begets with the inexorability of a law of Nature its own 
negation It is the negation of the negation 

Prophecy certainly need not be unscientific as predictions of eclipses and other astronomical events show But 
Hegelian dialectic or its materialistic version cannot be accepted as a sound basis for scientific forecasts But all 
Marxs predictions have come true Marxists usually answer They have not To quote one example out of many In 
Capital immediately after the last passage quoted Marx said that the transition from capitalism to socialism would 
naturally be a process incomparably less protracted violent and difficult than the industrial revolution and in a 
footnote he amplified this forecast by referring to the irresolute and nonresisting bourgeoisie Few Marxists will say 
nowadays that these predictions were successful Thus if 

 

 

forecasts based on dialectic are made some will come true and some will not In the latter case obviously a 
situation will arise which has not been foreseen But dialectic is vague and elastic enough to interpret and to explain 
this unforeseen situation just as well as it interpreted and explained the situation which it predicted and which 
happened not to come true Any development whatever will fit the dialectic scheme the dialectician need never be 
afraid of any refutation by future experience  As mentioned before it is not just the dialectical approach it is rather 
the very idea of a sociology which is a theory of historical developmentthe idea that the largescale historical 
forecast is the aim of scientific sociologywhich is mistaken But this does not concern us here 

Apart from the role dialectic plays in Marxs historical method Marxs antidogmatic attitude should be discussed 
Marx and Engels strongly insisted that science should not be interpreted as a body of final and wellestablished 
knowledge or of eternal truth but rather as something developing progressive The scientist is not the man who 
knows a lot but rather the man who is determined not to give up the search for truth Scientific systems develop and 
they develop according to Marx dialectically 

There is not very much to be said against this pointalthough personally I think that the dialectical description of 
scientific development is not always applicable unless it is forced and that it is better to describe scientific 
development in a less ambitious and ambiguous way as for example in terms of the trial and error theory But I am 
prepared to admit that this criticism is not of great importance It is however of real moment that Marxs progressive 
and antidogmatic view of science has never been applied by orthodox Marxists within the field of their own activities 
Progressive antidogmatic science is criticalcriticism is its very life But criticism of Marxism of dialectical 
materialism has never been tolerated by Marxists 

Hegel thought that philosophy develops yet his own system was to remain the last and highest stage of this 
development and could not be superseded The Marxists adopted the same attitude towards the Marxian system 
Hence Marxs antidogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of orthodox Marxism and 
dialectic is used by Marxists following the example of Engels AntiDhring mainly for the purposes of 
apologeticsto defend the Marxist system against criticism As a rule critics are denounced for their failure to 
understand the dialectic or proletarian science or for being traitors Thanks to dialectic the antidogmatic attitude has 
disappeared and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is elastic enough by using its dialectic 
method to evade any further attack It has thus become what I have called a reinforced dogmatism 

 
 In LScD I have tried to show that the scientific content of a theory is the greater the more the theory conveys 
the more it risks the more it is exposed to refutation by future experience If it takes no such risks its scientific 
content is zeroit has no scientific content it is metaphysical By this standard we can say that dialectic is 
unscientific it is metaphysical 

 

 

Yet there can be no worse obstacle to the growth of science than a reinforced dogmatism There can be no scientific 
development without the free competition of thoughtthis is the essence of the antidogmatic attitude once so 
strongly supported by Marx and Engels and in general there cannot be free competition in scientific thought without 
freedom for all thought 

Thus dialectic has played a very unfortunate role not only in the development of philosophy but also in the 
development of political theory A full understanding of this unfortunate role will be easier if we try to see how Marx 
originally came to develop such a theory We have to consider the whole situation Marx a young man who was 
progressive evolutionary and even revolutionary in his thought came under the influence of Hegel the most famous 
German philosopher Hegel had been a representative of Prussian reaction He had used his principle of the identity 
of reason and reality to support the existing powersfor what exists is reasonableand to defend the idea of the 
Abolute State an idea nowadays called Totalitarianism Marx who admired him but who was of a very different 
political temperament needed a philosophy on which to base his own political opinions We can understand his 
elation at discovering that Hegels dialectical philosophy could easily be turned against its own masterthat dialectic 
was in favour of a revolutionary political theory rather than of a conservative and apologetic one Besides this it was 
excellently adapted to his need for a theory which should be not only revolutionary but also optimistica theory 
forecasting progress by emphasizing that every new step is a step upwards 

This discovery although undeniably fascinating for a disciple of Hegel and in an era dominated by Hegel has now 
together with Hegelianism lost all significance and can hardly be considered to be more than the clever tour de 
force of a brilliant young student revealing a weakness in the speculations of his undeservedly famous master But it 
became the theoretical basis of what is called Scientific Marxism And it helped to turn Marxism into a dogmatic 
system by preventing the scientific development of which it might have been capable So Marxism has for decades 
kept its dogmatic attitude repeating against its opponents just the same arguments as were originally used by its 
founders It is sad but illuminating to see how orthodox Marxism today officially recommends as a basis for the study 
of scientific methodology the reading of Hegel Logicwhich is not merely obsolete but typical of prescientific and 
even prelogical ways of thinking It is worse than recommending Archimedes mechanics as a basis for modern 
engineering 

The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system
building It should remind us that philosophy must not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that 
philosophers should be much more modest in their claims One task which they can fulfil quite usefully is the study of 
the critical methods of science 

 

 

  
PREDICTION AND PROPHECY IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES 
I 

THE TOPIC of my address is Prediction and Prophecy in the Social Sciences My intention is to criticize 
the doctrine that it is the task of the social sciences to propound historical prophecies and that historical prophecies 
are needed if we wish to conduct politics in a rational way  I shall call this doctrine historicism I consider 
historicism to be the relic of an ancient superstition even though the people who believe in it are usually convinced 
that it is a very new progressive revolutionary and scientific theory 

The tenets of historicismthat it is the task of the social sciences to propound historical prophecies and that these 
historical prophecies are needed for any rational theoryare topical today because they form a very important part of 
that philosophy which likes to call itself by the name of Scientific Socialism or Marxism My analysis of the role of 
prediction and prophecy could therefore be described as a criticism of the historical method of Marxism But in fact it 
does not confine itself to that economic variant of historicism which is known as Marxism for it aims at criticizing the 
historicist doctrine in general Nevertheless I have decided to speak as if Marxism were my main or my only object of 
attack since I wish to avoid the accusation that I am attacking Marxism surreptitiously under the name of historicism 
But I should be glad if you would remember that whenever I mention Marxism I always have in mind a number of 
other philosophies of history also for I am trying to criticize a certain historical method which has been believed to be 
valid by many philosophers ancient and modern whose political views were very different from those of Marx 

 

 A fuller discussion of this problem and of a number of related problems will be found in my book The Poverty 
of Historicism    

 

 

As a critic of Marxism I shall try to interpret my task in a liberal spirit I shall feel free not only to criticize Marxism but 
also to defend certain of its contentions and I shall feel free to simplify its doctrines radically 

One of the points on which I feel sympathy with Marxists is their insistence that the social problems of our time are 
urgent and that philosophers ought to face the issues that we should not be content to interpret the world but should 
help to change it I am very much in sympathy with this attitude and the choice by the present assembly of the theme 
Man and Society shows that the need to discuss these problems is widely recognized The mortal danger into which 
mankind has flounderedno doubt the gravest danger in its historymust not be ignored by philosophers 

But what kind of contribution can philosophers makenot just as men not just as citizens but as philosophers Some 
Marxists insist that the problems are too urgent for further contemplation and that we ought to take sides at once But 
ifas philosopherswe can make any contribution at all then surely we must refuse to be rushed into blindly 
accepting readymade solutions however great the urgency of the hour as philosophers we can do no better than 
bring rational criticism to bear on the problems that face us and on the solutions advocated by the various parties To 
be more specific I believe that the best I can do as philosopher is to approach the problems armed with the weapons 
of a critic of methods This is what I propose to do 

II 

I may by way of introduction say why I have chosen this particular subject I am a rationalist and by this I mean that 
I believe in discussion and argument I also believe in the possibility as well as the desirability of applying science to 
problems arising in the social field But believing as I do in social science I can only look with apprehension upon 
social pseudoscience 

Many of my fellowrationalists are Marxists in England for example a considerable number of excellent physicists 
and biologists emphasize their allegiance to the Marxist doctrine They are attracted to Marxism by its claims a that 
it is a science b that it is progressive and c that it adopts the methods of prediction which the natural sciences 
practise Of course everything depends upon this third claim I shall therefore try to show that this claim is not 
justified and that the kind of prophecies which Marxism offers are in their logical character more akin to those of the 
Old Testament than to those of modern physics 

III 

I shall begin with a brief statement and criticism of the historical method of the alleged science of Marxism I shall 
have to oversimplify matters this is unavoidable But my oversimplifications may serve the purpose of bringing the 
decisive points into focus 

The central ideas of the historicist method and more especially of Marxism seem to be these 

 

 

a 

It is a fact that we can predict solar eclipses with a high degree of precision and for a long time ahead Why 
should we not be able to predict revolutions Had a social scientist in  known half as much about society 
as the old Babylonian astrologers knew about astronomy then he should have been able to predict the French 
Revolution 

The fundamental idea that it should be possible to predict revolutions just as it is possible to predict solar 
eclipses gives rise to the following view of the task of the social sciences 

b 

c 

The task of the social sciences is fundamentally the same as that of the natural sciencesto make predictions 
and more especially historical predictions that is to say predictions about the social and political development 
of mankind 
Once these predictions have been made the task of politics can be determined For it is to lessen the 
birthpangs as Marx calls them unavoidably connected with the political developments which have been 
predicted as impending 

These simple ideas especially the one claiming that it is the task of the social sciences to make historical predictions 
such as predictions of social revolutions I shall call the historicist doctrine of the social sciences The idea 
that it is the task of politics to lessen the birthpangs of impending political developments I shall call the historicist 
doctrine of politics Both these doctrines may be considered as parts of a wider philosophical scheme which may 

be called historicismthe view that the story of mankind has a plot and that if we can succeed in unravelling this plot 
we shall hold the key to the future 

IV 

I have briefly outlined two historicist doctrines concerning the task of the social sciences and of politics I have 
described these doctrines as Marxist But they are not peculiar to Marxism On the contrary they are among the 
oldest doctrines in the world In Marxs own time they were held in exactly the form described not only by Marx who 
inherited them from Hegel but by John Stuart Mill who inherited them from Comte And they were held in ancient 
times by Plato and before him by Heraclitus and Hesiod They seem to be of oriental origin indeed the Jewish idea 
of the chosen people is a typical historicist ideathat history has a plot whose author is Jahwe and that the plot can 
be partly unravelled by the prophets These ideas express one of the oldest dreams of mankindthe dream of 
prophecy the idea that we can know what the future has in store for us and that we can profit from such knowledge 
by adjusting our policy to it 

This ageold idea was sustained by the fact that prophecies of eclipses and of the movements of the planets were 
successful The close connection between historicist doctrine and astronomical knowledge is clearly exhibited in the 
ideas and practices of astrology 

These historical points have of course no bearing on the question whether 

 

 

or not the historicist doctrine concerning the task of the social sciences is tenable This question belongs to the 
methodology of the social sciences 

V 

The historicist doctrine which teaches that it is the task of the social sciences to predict historical developments is I 
believe untenable 

Admittedly all theoretical sciences are predicting sciences Admittedly there are social sciences which are theoretical 
But do these admissions imply as the historicists believethat the task of the social sciences is historical prophecy 
It looks like it but this impression disappears once we make a clear distinction between what I shall call scientific 
prediction on the one side and unconditional historical prophecies on the other Historicism fails to make 
this important distinction 

Ordinary predictions in science are conditional They assert that certain changes say of the temperature of water in 
a kettle will be accompanied by other changes say the boiling of the water Or to take a simple example from a 
social science Just as we can learn from a physicist that under certain physical conditions a boiler will explode so 
we can learn from the economist that under certain social conditions such as shortage of commodities controlled 
prices and say the absence of an effective punitive system a black market will develop 

Unconditional scientific predictions can sometimes be derived from these conditional scientific predictions together 

with historical statements which assert that the conditions in question are fulfilled From these premises we can 
obtain the unconditional prediction by the modus ponens If a physician has diagnosed scarlet fever then he may 
with the help of the conditional predictions of his science make the unconditional prediction that his patient will 
develop a rash of a certain kind But it is possible of course to make such unconditional prophecies without any such 
justification in a theoretical science orin other wordsin scientific conditional predictions They may be based for 
example on a dreamand by some accident they may even come true 

My contentions are two 

The first is that the historicist does not as a matter of fact derive his historical prophecies from conditional scientific 
predictions The second from which the first follows is that he cannot possibly do so because longterm prophecies 
can be derived from scientific conditional predictions only if they apply to systems which can be described as well
isolated stationary and recurrent These systems are very rare in nature and modern society is surely not one of 
them 

Let me develop this point a little more fully Eclipse prophecies and indeed prophecies based on the regularity of the 
seasons perhaps the oldest natural laws consciously understood by man are possible only because our solar 
system is a stationary and repetitive system and this is so because of the accident that it is isolated from the 
influence of other mechanical systems by 

 

 

immense regions of empty space and is therefore relatively free of interference from outside Contrary to popular 
belief the analysis of such repetitive systems is not typical of natural science These repetitive systems are special 
cases where scientific prediction becomes particularly impressivebut that is all Apart from this very exceptional 
case the solar system recurrent or cyclic systems are known especially in the field of biology The life cycles of 
organisms are part of a semistationary or very slowly changing biological chain of events Scientific predictions about 
life cycles of organisms can be made in so far as we abstract from the slow evolutionary changes that is to say in so 
far as we treat the biological system in question as stationary 

No basis can therefore be found in examples such as these for the contention that we can apply the method of long
term unconditional prophecy to human history Society is changing developing This development is not in the main 
repetitive True in so far as it is repetitive we may perhaps make certain prophecies For example there is 
undoubtedly some repetitiveness in the manner in which new religions arise or new tyrannies and a student of 
history may find that he can foresee such developments to a limited degree by comparing them with earlier instances 
ie by studying the conditions under which they arise But this application of the method of conditional prediction does 
not take us very far For the most striking aspects of historical development are nonrepetitive Conditions are 
changing and situations arise for example in consequence of new scientific discoveries which are very different 
from anything that ever happened before The fact that we can predict eclipses does not therefore provide a valid 
reason for expecting that we can predict revolutions 

These considerations hold not only for the evolution of man but also for the evolution of life in general There exists 
no law of evolution only the historical fact that plants and animals change or more precisely that they have 
changed The idea of a law which determines the direction and the character of evolution is a typical nineteenth
century mistake arising out of the general tendency to ascribe to the Natural Law the functions traditionally ascribed 

to God 

VI 

The realization that the social sciences cannot prophesy future historical developments has led some modern writers 
to despair of reason and to advocate political irrationalism Identifying predictive power with practical usefulness 
they denounce the social sciences as useless In an attempt to analyse the possibility of forecasting historical 
developments one of these modern irrationalists writes   The same element of uncertainty from which 

 

 H Morgenthau Scientific Man and Power Politics London  p  italics mine As indicated in my 
next paragraph Morgenthaus antirationalism can be understood as resulting from the disillusionment of a 
historicist who cannot conceive of any form of rationalism except a historicist form 

 

 

the natural sciences suffer affects the social sciences only more so Because of its quantitative extension it affects 
here not only theoretical structure but also practical usefulness 

But there is no need as yet to despair of reason Only those who do not distinguish between ordinary prediction and 
historical prophecy in other words only historicistsdisappointed historicistsare likely to draw such desperate 
conclusions The main usefulness of the physical sciences does not lie in the prediction of eclipses and similarly the 
practical usefulness of the social sciences does not depend on their power to prophesy historical or political 
developments Only an uncritical historicist that is to say one who believes in the historicist doctrine of the task of 
the social sciences as a matter of course will be driven to despair of reason by the realization that the social sciences 
cannot prophesy and some have in fact been driven even to hatred of reason 

VII 

What then is the task of the social sciences and how can they be useful 

In order to answer this question I shall first briefly mention two nave theories of society which must be disposed of 
before we can understand the function of the social sciences 

The first is the theory that the social sciences study the behaviour of social wholes such as groups nations classes 
societies civilizations etc These social wholes are conceived as the empirical objects which the social sciences 
study in the same way in which biology studies animals or plants 

This view must be rejected as nave It completely overlooks the fact that these socalled social wholes are very 
largely postulates of popular social theories rather than empirical objects and that while there are admittedly such 
empirical objects as the crowd of people here assembled it is quite untrue that names like the middleclass stand for 
any such empirical groups What they stand for is a kind of ideal object whose existence depends upon theoretical 
assumptions Accordingly the belief in the empirical existence of social wholes or collectives which may be 

described as nave collectivism has to be replaced by the demand that social phenomena including collectives 
should be analysed in terms of individuals and their actions and relations 

But this demand may easily give rise to another mistaken view the second and more important of the two views to be 
disposed of It may be described as the conspiracy theory of society It is the view that whatever happens in 
societyincluding things which people as a rule dislike such as war unemployment poverty shortagesare the 
results of direct design by some powerful individuals or groups This view is very widespread although it is I have no 
doubt a somewhat primitive kind of superstition It is older than historicism which may even be said to be a 
derivative of the conspiracy theory and in its modern form it is the typical result of the secularization of religious 
superstitions The belief in the Homeric gods whose conspiracies were responsible for the vicissitudes of the Trojan 
War is gone But the place 

 

 

of the gods on Homers Olympus is now taken by the Learned Elders of Zion or by the monopolists or the capitalists 
or the imperialists 

Against the conspiracy theory of society I do not of course assert that conspiracies never happen But I assert two 
things First they are not very frequent and do not change the character of social life Assuming that conspiracies 
were to cease we should still be faced with fundamentally the same problems which have always faced us 
Secondly I assert that conspiracies are very rarely successful The results achieved differ widely as a rule from the 
results aimed at Consider the Nazi conspiracy 

VIII 

Why do the results achieved by a conspiracy as a rule differ widely from the results aimed at Because this is what 
usually happens in social life conspiracy or no conspiracy And this remark gives us an opportunity to formulate the 
main task of the theoretical social sciences It is to trace the unintended social repercussions of 
intentional human actions I may give a simple example If a man wishes urgently to buy a house in a certain 
district we can safely assume that he does not wish to raise the market price of houses in that district But the very 
fact that he appears on the market as a buyer will tend to raise market prices And analogous remarks hold for the 
seller Or to take an example from a very different field if a man decides to insure his life he is unlikely to have the 
intention of encouraging other people to invest their money in insurance shares But he will do so nevertheless 

We see here clearly that not all consequences of our actions are intended consequences and accordingly that the 
conspiracy theory of society cannot be true because it amounts to the assertion that all events even those which at 
first sight do not seem to be intended by anybody are the intended results of the actions of people who are interested 
in these results 

It should be mentioned in this connection that Karl Marx himself was one of the first to emphasize the importance for 
the social sciences of these unintended consequences In his more mature utterances he says that we are all 
caught in the net of the social system The capitalist is not a demoniac conspirator but a man who is forced by 
circumstances to act as he does he is no more responsible for the state of affairs than is the proletarian 

This view of Marxs has been abandonedperhaps for propagandist reasons perhaps because people did not 
understand itand a Vulgar Marxist Conspiracy theory has very largely replaced it It is a comedownthe comedown 
from Marx to Goebbels But it is clear that the adoption of the conspiracy theory can hardly be avoided by those who 
believe that they know how to make heaven on earth The only explanation for their failure to produce this heaven is 
the malevolence of the devil who has a vested interest in hell 

IX 

The view that it is the task of the theoretical sciences to discover the unintended consequences of our actions brings 
these sciences very close to the 

 

 

experimental natural sciences The analogy cannot here be developed in detail but it may be remarked that both lead 
us to the formulation of practical technological rules stating what we cannot do 

The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed as the technological warning You cannot build a machine 
which is  per cent efficient A similar rule of the social sciences would be You cannot without increasing 
productivity raise the real income of the working population and You cannot equalize real incomes and at the same 
time raise productivity An example of a promising hypothesis in this field which is by no means generally accepted
or in other words a problem that is still openis the following You cannot have a full employment policy without 
inflation These examples may show the way in which the social sciences are practically important They do not allow 
us to make historical prophecies but they may give us an idea of what can and what cannot be done in the political 
field 

We have seen that the historicist doctrine is untenable but this fact does not lead us to lose faith in science or in 
reason On the contrary we now see that it gives rise to a clearer insight into the role of science in social life Its 
practical role is the modest one of helping us to understand even the more remote consequences of possible actions 
and thus of helping us to choose our actions more wisely 

X 

The elimination of the historicist doctrine destroys Marxism completely as far as its scientific pretensions go But it 
does not yet destroy the more technical or political claims of Marxismthat only a social revolution a complete 
recasting of our social system can produce social conditions fit for men to live in 

I shall not here discuss the problem of the humanitarian aims of Marxism I find that there is a very great deal in these 
aims which I can accept The hope of reducing misery and violence and of increasing freedom is one I believe 
which inspired Marx and many of his followers it is a hope which inspires most of us 

But I am convinced that these aims cannot be realized by revolutionary methods On the contrary I am convinced 
that revolutionary methods can only make things worsethat they will increase unnecessary suffering that they will 
lead to more and more violence and that they must destroy freedom 

This becomes clear when we realize that a revolution always destroys the institutional and traditional framework of 
society It must thereby endanger the very set of values for the realization of which it has been undertaken Indeed a 
set of values can have social significance only in so far as there exists a social tradition which upholds them This is 
true of the aims of a revolution as much as of any other values 

But if you begin to revolutionize society and to eradicate its traditions you cannot stop this process if and when you 
please In a revolution everything is questioned including the aims of the wellmeaning revolutionaries aims 

 

 

which grow from and which were necessarily a part of the society which the revolution destroys 

Some people say that they do not mind this that it is their greatest wish to clean the canvas thoroughlyto create a 
social tabula rasa and to begin afresh by painting on it a brand new social system But they should not be 
surprised if they find that once they destroy tradition civilization disappears with it They will find that mankind have 
returned to the position in which Adam and Eve beganor using less biblical language that they have returned to the 
beasts All that these revolutionary progressivists will then be able to do is to begin the slow process of human 
evolution again and so to arrive in a few thousand years perhaps at another capitalist period which will lead them to 
another sweeping revolution followed by another return to the beasts and so on for ever and ever In other words 
there is no earthly reason why a society whose traditional set of values has been destroyed should of its own accord 
become a better society unless you believe in political miracles  or hope that once the conspiracy of the devilish 
capitalists is broken up society will naturally tend to become beautiful and good 

Marxists of course will not admit this But the Marxist view that is to say the view that the social revolution will lead 
to a better world is only understandable on the historicist assumptions of Marxism If you know on the basis of 
historical prophecy what the result of the social revolution must be and if you know that the result is all that we hope 
for then but only then can you consider the revolution with its untold suffering as a means to the end of untold 
happiness But with the elimination of the historicist doctrine the theory of revolution becomes completely untenable 

The view that it will be the task of the revolution to rid us of the capitalist conspiracy and with it of opposition to 
social reform is widely held but it is untenable even if we assume for a moment that such a conspiracy exists For a 
revolution is liable to replace old masters by new ones and who guarantees that the new ones will be better The 
theory of revolution overlooks the most important aspect of social lifethat what we need is not so much good men as 
good institutions Even the best man may be corrupted by power but institutions which permit the ruled to exert some 
effective control over the rulers will force even bad rulers to do what the ruled consider to be in their interests Or to 
put it another way we should like to have good rulers but historical experience shows us that we are not likely to get 
them This is why it is of such importance to design institutions which prevent even bad rulers from causing too much 
damage 

There are only two kinds of governmental institutions those which provide for a change of the government without 
bloodshed and those which do not But if the government cannot be changed without bloodshed it cannot in most 
cases be removed at all We need not quarrel about words and about such pseudoproblems as the true or essential 
meaning of the word democracy You can choose whatever name you like for the two types of govern 

 

 The phrase is due to Julius Kraft 

 

 

ment I personally prefer to call the type of government which can be removed without violence democracy and the 
other tyranny But as I said this is not a quarrel about words but an important distinction between two types of 
institutions 

Marxists have been taught to think in terms not of institutions but of classes Classes however never rule any more 
than nations The rulers are always certain persons And whatever class they may once have belonged to once they 
are rulers they belong to the ruling class 

Marxists nowadays do not think in terms of institutions they put their faith in certain personalities or perhaps in the 
fact that certain persons were once proletariansa result of their belief in the overruling importance of classes and 
class loyalties Rationalists on the contrary are more inclined to rely on institutions for controlling men This is the 
main difference 

XI 

But what ought the rulers to do In opposition to most historicists I believe that this question is far from vain it is one 
which we ought to discuss For in a democracy the rulers will be compelled by the threat of dismissal to do what 
public opinion wants them to do And public opinion is a thing which all can influence and especially philosophers In 
democracies the ideas of philosophers have often influenced future developmentswith a very considerable timelag 
to be sure British social policy is now that of Bentham and of John Stuart Mill who summed up its aim as that of 
securing full employment at high wages for the whole labouring population  

I believe that philosophers should continue to discuss the proper aims of social policy in the light of the experience of 
the last fifty years Instead of confining themselves to discussing the nature of ethics or of the greatest good etc 
they should think about such fundamental and difficult ethical and political questions as are raised by the fact that 
political freedom is impossible without some principle of equality before the law that since absolute freedom is 
impossible we must with Kant demand in its stead equality with respect to those limitations of freedom which are 
the unavoidable consequences of social life and that on the other hand the pursuit of equality especially in its 
economic sense much as it is desirable in itself may become a threat to freedom 

And similarly they should consider the fact that the greatest happiness principle of the Utilitarians can easily be made 
an excuse for a benevolent dictatorship and the proposal  that we should replace it by a more modest and more 
realistic principlethe principle that the fight against avoidable misery should be a recognized aim of public policy 
while the increase of happiness should be left in the main to private initiative 

 

 In his Autobiography  p  My attention has been drawn to this passage by F A Hayek For further 
comments on public opinion see also chapter  below 

 I am using the term proposal here in the technical sense in which it is advocated by L J Russell Cp his paper 
Propositions and Proposals in the Proc of the Tenth Intern Congress of Philosophy 
Amsterdam  

 

 

This modified Utilitarianism could I believe lead much more easily to agreement on social reform For new ways of 
happiness are theoretical unreal things about which it may be difficult to form an opinion But misery is with us here 
and now and it will be with us for a long time to come We all know it from experience Let us make it our task to 
impress on public opinion the simple thought that it is wise to combat the most urgent and real social evils one by 
one here and now instead of sacrificing generations for a distant and perhaps forever unrealizable greatest good 

XII 

The historicist revolution like most intellectual revolutions seems to have had little effect on the basically theistic and 
authoritarian structure of European thought  

The earlier naturalistic revolution against God replaced the name God by the name Nature Almost everything else 
was left unchanged Theology the Science of God was replaced by the Science of Nature Gods laws by the laws of 
Nature Gods will and power by the will and the power of Nature the natural forces and later Gods design and 
Gods judgment by Natural Selection Theological determinism was replaced by a naturalistic determinism that is 
Gods omnipotence and omniscience were replaced by the omnipotence of Nature  and the omniscience of Science 

Hegel and Marx replaced the goddess Nature in its turn by the goddess History So we get laws of History powers 
forces tendencies designs and plans of History and the omnipotence and omniscience of historical determinism 
Sinners against God are replaced by criminals who vainly resist the march of History and we learn that not God but 
History will be our judge 

It is this deification of history which I am combatting 

But the sequence GodNatureHistory and the sequence of the corresponding secularized religions does not 
end here The historicist discovery that all standards are after all only historical facts in God standards and facts are 
one leads to the deification of Factsof existing or actual Facts of human life and behaviour including I am afraid 
merely alleged Factsand thus to the secularized religions of existentialism positivism and behaviourism Since 
human behaviour includes verbal behaviour we are led still further to the deification of the Facts of Language  
Appeal to the logical and moral authority of these Facts or alleged Facts is it would seem the ultimate wisdom of 
philosophy in our time

PUBLIC OPINION AND LIBERAL PRINCIPLES 

THE following remarks were designed to provide material for debate at an international conference of liberals in the 
English sense of this term see the end of the Preface My purpose was simply to lay the foundations for a good 
general discussion Because I could assume Liberal views in my audience I was largely concerned to challenge 
rather than to endorse popular assumptions favourable to these views 

 THE MYTH OF PUBLIC OPINION 

We should beware of a number of myths concerning public opinion which are often accepted uncritically 

There is first the classical myth vox populi vox dei which attributes to the voice of the people a kind of final 
authority and unlimited wisdom Its modern equivalent is faith in the ultimate commonsense rightness of that mythical 
figure the man in the street his vote and his voice The avoidance of the plural in both cases is characteristic Yet 
people are thank God seldom univocal and the various men in the various streets are as different as any collection 
of VIPs in a conferenceroom And if on occasion they do speak more or less in unison what they say is not 
necessarily wise They may be right or they may be wrong The voice may be very firm on very doubtful issues 
Example the nearly unanimous and unquestioning acceptance of the demand for unconditional surrender And it 
may waver on issues over which there is hardly room for doubt Example the question whether to condone political 
blackmail and massmurder It may be wellintentioned but imprudent Example the public reaction which destroyed 
the HoareLaval plan Or it may be neither wellintentioned nor very prudent Example the approval of the 
Runciman mission the approval of the Munich agreement of  

 

 

 

I believe nevertheless that there is a kernal of truth hidden in the vox populi myth One might put it in this way In 
spite of the limited information at their disposal many simple men are often wiser than their governments and if not 
wiser then inspired by better or more generous intentions Examples the readiness of the people of Czechoslovakia 
to fight on the eve of Munich the HoareLaval reaction again 

One form of the mythor perhaps of the philosophy behind the mythwhich seems to me of particular interest and 
importance is the doctrine that truth is manifest By this I mean the doctrine that though error is something that 
needs to be explained by lack of good will or by bias or by prejudice truth will always make itself known as long as 
it is not suppressed Thus arises the belief that liberty by sweeping away oppression and other obstacles must of 
necessity lead to a Reign of Truth and Goodnessto an Elysium created by reason and graced by the purest 
pleasures known to the love of mankind in the words of the concluding sentence of Condorcet Sketch for a 
Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind 

I have consciously oversimplified this important myth which also may be formulated Nobody if presented with the 
truth can fail to recognize it I propose to call this the theory of rationalist optimism It is a theory indeed which the 
Enlightenment shares with most of its political offspring and its intellectual forbears Like the vox populi myth it is 
another myth of the univocal voice If humanity is a Being we ought to worship then the unanimous voice of mankind 
ought to be our final authority But we have learned to distrust unanimity 

A reaction to this rationalist and optimistic myth is the romantic version of the vox populi theorythe doctrine of the 
authority and uniqueness of the popular will of the volont generale of the spirit of the people of the genius of 
the nation of the group mind or of the instinct of the blood I need hardly repeat here the criticism which Kant and 
othersamong them myself have levelled against these doctrines of the irrational grasp of truth which culminates in 
the Hegelian doctrine of the cunning of reason which uses our passions as instruments for the instinctive or intuitive 
grasp of truth and which makes it impossible for the people to be wrong especially if they follow their passions rather 
than their reason 

An important and still very influential variant of the myth may be described as the myth of the progress of public 
opinion which is the myth of public opinion of the nineteenthcentury Liberal It may be illustrated by quoting a 
passage from Anthony Trollope Phineas Finn to which Professor E H Gombrich has drawn my attention Trollope 
describes the fate of a parliamentary motion for Irish tenant rights The division comes and the Ministry is beaten by 
a majority of twentythree And now says Mr Monk MP the pity is that we are not a bit nearer tenantrights than 
we were before 

But we are nearer to it In one sense yes Such a debate and such a majority will make men think 
But 

 

 

nothink is too high a word as a rule men dont think But it will make them believe that there is 
something in it Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical will now fancy that 
it is only dangerous or perhaps not more than difficult And so in time it will come to be looked on as 
among the things possible then among the things probableand so at last it will be ranged in the list 
of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed That is the way in 
which public opinion is made 

It is not loss of time said Phineas to have taken the first great step in making it 

The first great step was taken long ago said Mr Monktaken by men who were looked upon as revolutionary 
demagogues almost as traitors because they took it But it is a great thing to take any step that leads us onwards 

The theory here expounded by the radicalliberal Member of Parliament Mr Monk may be perhaps called the avant
garde theory of public opinion or the theory of the leadership of the advanced It is the theory that there are 
some leaders or creators of public opinion who by books and pamphlets and letters to The Times or by 
parliamentary speeches and motions manage to get some ideas first rejected and later debated and finally accepted 
Public opinion is here conceived as a kind of public response to the thoughts and efforts of those aristocrats of the 
mind who produce new thoughts new ideas new arguments It is conceived as slow as somewhat passive and by 
nature conservative but nevertheless as capable in the end of intuitively discerning the truth of the claims of the 
reformersas the slowmoving but final and authoritative umpire of the debates of the elite This no doubt is again 
another form of our myth however much of the English reality may at first sight appear to conform to it No doubt the 
claims of reformers have often succeeded in exactly this way But did only the valid claims succeed I am inclined to 
believe that in Great Britain it is not so much the truth of an assertion or the wisdom of a proposal that is likely to win 
for a policy the support of public opinion as the feeling that injustice is being done which can and must be rectified It 
is the characteristic moral sensitivity of public opinion and the way in which it has often been roused at least in 
the past which is described by Trollope its intuition of injustice rather than its intuition of factual truth It is debatable 
how far Trollopes description is applicable to other countries and it would be dangerous to assume that even in 
Great Britain it will always remain as sensitive as it has been in the past 

 THE DANGERS OF PUBLIC OPINION 

Public opinion whatever it may be is very powerful It may change governments even nondemocratic governments 
Liberals ought to regard any such power with some degree of suspicion 

Owing to its anonymity public opinion is an irresponsible form of power and therefore particularly dangerous 
from the liberal point of view Example colour bars and other racial questions The remedy in one direction is 
obvious by minimizing the power of the state the danger of the influence 

 

 

of public opinion exerted through the agency of the state will be reduced But this does not secure the freedom of 
the individuals behaviour and thought from the direct pressure of public opinion Here the individual needs the 
powerful protection of the state These conflicting requirements can be at least partly met by a certain kind of 
traditionof which more below 

The doctrine that public opinion is not irresponsible but somehow responsible to itselfin the sense that its mistakes 
will rebound upon the public who held the mistaken opinionis another form of the collectivist myth of public opinion 
the mistaken propaganda of one group of citizens may easily harm a very different group 

 LIBERAL PRINCIPLES A GROUP OF THESES 

 The state is a necessary evil its powers are not to be multiplied beyond what is necessary One might call this 
principle the Liberal Razor In analogy to Ockhams Razor ie the famous principle that entities or essences 
must not be multiplied beyond what is necessary 

In order to show the necessity of the state I do not appeal to Hobbes homohominilupus view of man On the 
contrary its necessity can be shown even if we assume that homo homini felis or even that homo homini 
angelus in other words even if we assume that because of their gentleness or angelic goodness nobody ever 
harms anybody else In such a world there would still be weaker and stronger men and the weaker ones would have 
no legal right to be tolerated by the stronger ones but would owe them gratitude for their being so kind as to 
tolerate them Those whether strong or weak who think this an unsatisfactory state of affairs and who think that 
every person should have a right to live and that every person should have a legal claim to be protected against 
the power of the strong will agree that we need a state that protects the rights of all 

It is easy to see that the state must be a constant danger or as I have ventured to call it an evil though a necessary 
one For if the state is to fulfil its function it must have more power at any rate than any single private citizen or public 
corporation and although we might design institutions to minimize the danger that these powers will be misused we 
can never eliminate the danger completely On the contrary it seems that most men will always have to pay for the 
protection of the state not only in the form of taxes but even in the form of humiliation suffered for example at the 
hands of bullying officials The thing is not to pay too heavily for it 

 The difference between a democracy and a tyranny is that under a democracy the government can be got rid of 
without bloodshed under a tyranny it cannot 

 Democracy as such cannot confer any benefits upon the citizen and it should not be expected to do so In fact 
democracy can do nothingonly the citizens of the democracy can act including of course those citizens who 
comprise the government Democracy provides no more than a framework 

 

 

within which the citizens may act in a more or less organized and coherent way 

 We are democrats not because the majority is always right but because democratic traditions are the least evil 
ones of which we know If the majority or public opinion decides in favour of tyranny a democrat need not therefore 
suppose that some fatal inconsistency in his views has been revealed He will realize rather that the democratic 
tradition in his country was not strong enough 

 Institutions alone are never sufficient if not tempered by traditions Institutions are always ambivalent in the sense 
that in the absence of a strong tradition they also may serve the opposite purpose to the one intended For example 
a parliamentary opposition is roughly speaking supposed to prevent the majority from stealing the taxpayers money 
But I well remember an affair in a southeastern European country which illustrates the ambivalence of this institution 
There the opposition shared the spoils with the majority 

To sum up Traditions are needed to form a kind of link between institutions and the intentions and valuations of 
individual men 

 A Liberal Utopiathat is a state rationally designed on a traditionless tabula rasais an impossibility For the 
Liberal principle demands that the limitations to the freedom of each which are made necessary by social life should 
be minimized and equalized as much as possible  Kant But how can we apply such an a priori principle in real 
life Should we prevent a pianist from practising or prevent his neighbour from enjoying a quiet afternoon All such 
problems can be solved in practice only by an appeal to existing traditions and customs and to a traditional sense of 
justice to common law as it is called in Britain and to an impartial judges appreciation of equity All laws being 
universal principles have to be interpreted in order to be applied and an interpretation needs some principles of 
concrete practice which can be supplied only by a living tradition And this holds more especially for the highly 
abstract and universal principles of Liberalism 

 Principles of Liberalism may be described as principles of assessing and if necessary of modifying or changing 
existing institutions rather than of replacing existing institutions One can express this also by saying that Liberalism 
is an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary creed unless it is confronted by a tyrannical regime 

 Among the traditions we must count as the most important is what we may call the moral 
framework corresponding to the institutional legal framework of a society This incorporates the societys traditional 
sense of justice or fairness or the degree of moral sensitivity it has reached This moral framework serves as the 
basis which makes it possible to reach a fair or equitable compromise between conflicting interests where this is 
necessary It is of course itself not unchangeable but it changes comparatively slowly Nothing is more dangerous 
than the destruction of this traditional framework Its destruction was consciously aimed at by Nazism In the end its 

 

 

destruction will lead to cynicism and nihilism ie to the disregard and the dissolution of all human values 
 THE LIBERAL THEORY OF FREE DISCUSSION 
Freedom of thought and free discussion are ultimate Liberal values which do not really need any further justification 
Nevertheless they can also be justified pragmatically in terms of the part they play in the search for truthTruth is not 
manifest and it is not easy to come by The search for truth demands at least 
a 
b 
c 

imagination 
trial and error 
the gradual discovery of our prejudices by way of a of b and of critical discussion 

The Western rationalist tradition which derives from the Greeks is the tradition of critical discussionof examining 
and testing propositions or theories by attempting to refute them This critical rational method must not be mistaken 
for a method of proof that is to say for a method of finally establishing truth nor is it a method which always secures 
agreement Its value lies rather in the fact that participants in a discussion will to some extent change their minds 
and part as wiser men 

It is often asserted that discussion is only possible between people who have a common language and accept 
common basic assumptions I think that this is a mistake All that is needed is a readiness to learn from ones partner 
in the discussion which includes a genuine wish to understand what he intends to say If this readiness is there the 
discussion will be the more fruitful the more the partners backgrounds differ Thus the value of a discussion depends 
largely upon the variety of the competing views Had there been no Tower of Babel we should invent it The liberal 
does not dream of a perfect consensus of opinion he only hopes for the mutual fertilization of opinions and the 
consequent growth of ideas Even when we solve a problem to universal satisfaction we create in solving it many 
new problems over which we are bound to disagree This is not to be regretted 

Although the search for truth through free rational discussion is a public affair it is not public opinion whatever this 
may be which results from it Though public opinion may be influenced by science and may judge science it is not 
the product of scientific discussion 

But the tradition of rational discussion creates in the political field the tradition of government by discussion and with 
it the habit of listening to another point of view the growth of a sense of justice and the readiness to compromise 

Our hope is thus that traditions changing and developing under the influence of critical discussion and in response to 
the challenge of new problems may replace much of what is usually called public opinion and take over the 
functions which public opinion is supposed to fulfil 

 

 

 THE FORMS OF PUBLIC OPINION 
There are two main forms of public opinion institutionalized and noninstitutionalizedExamples of institutions serving 
or influencing public opinion the press including Letters to the Editor political parties societies like the Mont Plerin 
Society Universities bookpublishing broadcasting theatre cinema televisionExamples of noninstitutionalized 
public opinion what people say in railway carriages and other public places about the latest news or about 
foreigners or about coloured men or what they say about one another across the dinner table This may even 
become institutionalized 
 SOME PRACTICAL PROBLEMS CENSORSHIP AND 
MONOPOLIES OF PUBLICITY 
No theses are offered in this sectiononly problems 

How far does the case against censorship depend upon a tradition of selfimposed censorship 
How far do publishers monopolies establish a kind of censorship How far are thinkers free to publish their 
ideas Can there be complete freedom to publish And ought there to be complete freedom to publish 
anything 
The influence and responsibility of the intelligentsia a upon the spread of ideas example socialism b 
upon the acceptance of often tyrannical fashions example abstract art 
The freedom of the Universities a state interference b private interference c interference in the name of 
public opinion 
The management of or planning for public opinion Public relations officers 
The problem of the propaganda for cruelty in newspapers especially in comics cinema etc 
The problem of taste Standardization and levelling 
The problem of propaganda and advertisement versus the spread of information

 SUMMARY 

That intangible and vague entity called public opinion sometimes reveals an unsophisticated shrewdness or more 
typically a moral sensitivity superior to that of the government in power Nevertheless it is a danger to freedom if it is 
not moderated by a strong liberal tradition It is dangerous as an arbiter of taste and unacceptable as an arbiter of 
truth But it may sometimes assume the role of an enlightened arbiter of justice Example The liberation of slaves in 
the British colonies Unfortunately it can be managed These dangers can be counteracted only by strengthening 
the liberal tradition 

Public opinion should be distinguished from the publicity of free and critical discussion which is or should be the rule 
in science and which includes the discussion of questions of justice and other moral issues Public opinion is 
influenced by but neither the result of nor under the control of discussions of this kind Their beneficial influence will 
be the greater the more honestly simply and clearly these discussions are conducted 

 

 

  
UTOPIA AND VIOLENCE 

THERE ARE many people who hate violence and are convinced that it is one of their foremost and at the same 
time one of their most hopeful tasks to work for its reduction and if possible for its elimination from human life I am 
among these hopeful enemies of violence I not only hate violence but I firmly believe that the fight against it is not at 
all hopeless I realize that the task is difficult I realize that only too often in the course of history it has happened that 
what appeared at first to be a great success in the fight against violence was followed by defeat I do not overlook the 
fact that the new age of violence which was opened by the two World wars is by no means at an end Nazism and 
Fascism are thoroughly beaten but I must admit that their defeat does not mean that barbarism and brutality have 
been defeated On the contrary it is no use closing our eyes to the fact that these hateful ideas achieved something 
like victory in defeat I have to admit that Hitler succeeded in degrading the moral standards of our Western world 
and that in the world of today there is more violence and brutal force than would have been tolerated even in the 
decade after the first World war And we must face the possibility that our civilization may ultimately be destroyed by 
those new weapons which Hitlerism wished upon us perhaps even within the first decade  after the second World 
war for no doubt the spirit of Hitlerism won its greatest victory over us when after its defeat we used the weapons 
which the threat of Nazism had induced us to develop But in spite of all this I am today no less hopeful than I have 
ever been that violence can be defeated It is our only hope and long stretches in the history of Western as well as of 
Eastern civilizations prove that it need not be a vain hopethat violence can be reduced and brought under the 
control of reason 

This is perhaps why I like many others believe in reason why I call myself a rationalist I am a rationalist because I 
see in the attitude of reasonableness the only alternative to violence 

When two men disagree they do so either because their opinions differ or 

 

 This was written in  Today I should alter this passage merely by replacing first by second 

 

 

because their interests differ or both There are many kinds of disagreement in social life which must be decided one 
way or another The question may be one which must be settled because failure to settle it may create new 
difficulties whose cumulative effects may cause an intolerable strain such as a state of continual and intense 
preparation for deciding the issue An armaments race is an example To reach a decision may be a necessity 

How can a decision be reached There are in the main only two possible ways argument including arguments 
submitted to arbitration for example to some international court of justice and violence Or if it is interests that clash 
the two alternatives are a reasonable compromise or an attempt to destroy the opposing interest 

A rationalist as I use the word is a man who attempts to reach decisions by argument and perhaps in certain cases 
by compromise rather than by violence He is a man who would rather be unsuccessful in convincing another man by 
argument than successful in crushing him by force by intimidation and threats or even by persuasive propaganda 

We shall understand better what I mean by reasonableness if we consider the difference between trying to convince 
a man by argument and trying to persuade him by propaganda 

The difference does not lie so much in the use of argument Propaganda often uses argument too Nor does the 
difference lie in our conviction that our arguments are conclusive and must be admitted to be conclusive by any 
reasonable man It lies rather in an attitude of give and take in a readiness not only to convince the other man but 
also possibly to be convinced by him What I call the attitude of reasonableness may be characterized by a remark 
like this I think I am right but I may be wrong and you may be right and in any case let us discuss it for in this way 
we are likely to get nearer to a true understanding than if we each merely insist that we are right 

It will be realized that what I call the attitude of reasonableness or the rationalistic attitude presupposes a certain 
amount of intellectual humility Perhaps only those can take it up who are aware that they are sometimes wrong and 
who do not habitually forget their mistakes It is born of the realization that we are not omniscient and that we owe 
most of our knowledge to others It is an attitude which tries as far as possible to transfer to the field of opinions in 
general the two rules of every legal proceeding first that one should always hear both sides and secondly that one 
does not make a good judge if one is a party to the case 

I believe that we can avoid violence only in so far as we practise this attitude of reasonableness when dealing with 
one another in social life and that any other attitude is likely to produce violenceeven a onesided attempt to deal 
with others by gentle persuasion and to convince them by argument and example of those insights we are proud of 
possessing and of whose truth we are absolutely certain We all remember how many religious wars were fought for 
a religion of love and gentleness how many bodies were burned alive with the genuinely kind intention of saving 
souls from the eternal fire of hell Only 

 

if we give up our authoritarian attitude in the realm of opinion only if we establish the attitude of give and take of 
readiness to learn from other people can we hope to control acts of violence inspired by piety and duty 

There are many difficulties impeding the rapid spread of reasonableness One of the main difficulties is that it always 
takes two to make a discussion reasonable Each of the parties must be ready to learn from the other You cannot 
have a rational discussion with a man who prefers shooting you to being convinced by you In other words there are 
limits to the attitude of reasonableness It is the same with tolerance You must not without qualification accept the 
principle of tolerating all those who are intolerant if you do you will destroy not only yourself but also the attitude of 
tolerance All this is indicated in the remark I made beforethat reasonableness must be an attitude of give and 
take 

An important consequence of all this is that we must not allow the distinction between attack and defence to become 
blurred We must insist upon this distinction and support and develop social institutions national as well as 
international whose function it is to discriminate between aggression and resistance to aggression 

I think I have said enough to make clear what I intend to convey by calling myself a rationalist My rationalism is not 
dogmatic I fully admit that I cannot rationally prove it I frankly confess that I choose rationalism because I hate 
violence and I do not deceive myself into believing that this hatred has any rational grounds Or to put it another way 
my rationalism is not selfcontained but rests on an irrational faith in the attitude of reasonableness I do not see that 
we can go beyond this One could say perhaps that my irrational faith in equal and reciprocal rights to convince 
others and be convinced by them is a faith in human reason or simply that I believe in man 

If I say that I believe in man I mean in man as he is and I should never dream of saying that he is wholly rational I 
do not think that a question such as whether man is more rational than emotional or vice versa should be asked 
there are no ways of assessing or comparing such things I admit that I feel inclined to protest against certain 
exaggerations arising largely from a vulgarization of psychoanalysis of the irrationality of man and of human 
society But I am aware not only of the power of emotions in human life but also of their value I should never 
demand that the attainment of an attitude of reasonableness should become the one dominant aim of our lives All I 
wish to assert is that this attitude can become one that is never wholly absentnot even in relationships which are 
dominated by great passions such as love  

My fundamental attitude towards the problem of reason and violence will by now be understood and I hope I share it 
with some of my readers and with 

 

 The existentialist Jaspers writes This is why love is cruel ruthless and why it is believed in by the genuine lover 
only if it is so This attitude to my mind reveals weakness rather than the strength it wishes to show it is not so 
much plain barbarism as an hysterical attempt to play the barbarian Cf my Open Society th edn vol n p 
 

 

 

 

many other people everywhere It is on this basis that I now propose to discuss the problem of Utopianism 

I think we can describe Utopianism as a result of a form of rationalism and I shall try to show that this is a form of 
rationalism very different from the form in which I and many others believe So I shall try to show that there exist at 
least two forms of rationalism one of which I believe is right and the other wrong and that the wrong kind of 
rationalism is the one which leads to Utopianism 

As far as I can see Utopianism is the result of a way of reasoning which is accepted by many who would be 
astonished to hear that this apparently quite inescapable and selfevident way of reasoning leads to Utopian results 
This specious reasoning can perhaps be presented in the following manner 

An action it may be argued is rational if it makes the best use of the available means in order to achieve a certain 
end The end admittedly may be incapable of being determined rationally However this may be we can judge an 
action rationally and describe it as rational or adequate only relative to some given end Only if we have an end in 
mind and only relative to such an end can we say that we are acting rationally 

Now let us apply this argument to politics All politics consists of actions and these actions will be rational only if they 
pursue some end The end of a mans political actions may be the increase of his own power or wealth Or it may 
perhaps be the improvement of the laws of the state a change in the structure of the state 

In the latter case political action will be rational only if we first determine the final ends of the political changes which 
we intend to bring about It will be rational only relative to certain ideas of what a state ought to be like Thus it 
appears that as a preliminary to any rational political action we must first attempt to become as clear as possible 
about our ultimate political ends for example the kind of state which we should consider the best and only afterwards 
can we begin to determine the means which may best help us to realize this state or to move slowly towards it 
taking it as the aim of a historical process which we may to some extent influence and steer towards the goal 
selected 

Now it is precisely this view which I call Utopianism Any rational and nonselfish political action on this view must be 
preceded by a determination of our ultimate ends not merely of intermediate or partial aims which are only steps 
towards our ultimate end and which therefore should be considered as means rather than as ends therefore rational 
political action must be based upon a more or less clear and detailed description or blueprint of our ideal state and 
also upon a plan or blueprint of the historical path that leads towards this goal 

I consider what I call Utopianism an attractive and indeed an all too attractive theory for I also consider it dangerous 
and pernicious It is I believe selfdefeating and it leads to violence 

That it is selfdefeating is connected with the fact that it is impossible to 

 

 

determine ends scientifically There is no scientific way of choosing between two ends Some people for example 
love and venerate violence For them a life without violence would be shallow and trivial Many others of whom I am 
one hate violence This is a quarrel about ends It cannot be decided by science This does not mean that the 
attempt to argue against violence is necessarily a waste of time It only means that you may not be able to argue with 
the admirer of violence He has a way of answering an argument with a bullet if he is not kept under control by the 
threat of counterviolence If he is willing to listen to your arguments without shooting you then he is at least infected 
by rationalism and you may perhaps win him over This is why arguing is no waste of timeas long as people listen 
to you But you cannot by means of argument make people listen to argument you cannot by means of argument 
convert those who suspect all argument and who prefer violent decisions to rational decisions You cannot prove to 
them that they are wrong And this is only a particular case which can be generalized No decision about aims can 
be established by purely rational or scientific means Nevertheless argument may prove extremely helpful in 
reaching a decision about aims 

Applying all this to the problem of Utopianism we must first be quite clear that the problem of constructing a Utopian 
blueprint cannot possibly be solved by science alone Its aims at least must be given before the social scientist can 
begin to sketch his blueprint We find the same situation in the natural sciences No amount of physics will tell a 
scientist that it is the right thing for him to construct a plough or an aeroplane or an atomic bomb Ends must be 
adopted by him or given to him and what he does qua scientist is only to construct means by which these ends can 
be realized 

In emphasizing the difficulty of deciding by way of rational argument between different Utopian ideals I do not wish 
to create the impression that there is a realmsuch as the realm of endswhich goes altogether beyond the power of 
rational criticism even though I certainly wish to say that the realm of ends goes largely beyond the power of 
scientific argument For I myself try to argue about this realm and by pointing out the difficulty of deciding between 
competing Utopian blueprints I try to argue rationally against choosing ideal ends of this kind Similarly my attempt 
to point out that this difficulty is likely to produce violence is meant as a rational argument although it will appeal only 
to those who hate violence 

That the Utopian method which chooses an ideal state of society as the aim which all our political actions should 
serve is likely to produce violence can be shown thus Since we cannot determine the ultimate ends of political 
actions scientifically or by purely rational methods differences of opinion concerning what the ideal state should be 
like cannot always be smoothed out by the method of argument They will at least partly have the character of 
religious differences And there can be no tolerance between these different Utopian religions Utopian aims are 
designed to serve as a basis for rational political action and discussion and such action appears to be possible only if 

 

 

the aim is definitely decided upon Thus the Utopianist must win over or else crush his Utopianist competitors who 
do not share his own Utopian aims and who do not profess his own Utopianist religion 

But he has to do more He has to be very thorough in eliminating and stamping out all heretical competing views For 
the way to the Utopian goal is long Thus the rationality of his political action demands constancy of aim for a long 
time ahead and this can only be achieved if he not merely crushes competing Utopian religions but as far as 
possible stamps out all memory of them 

The use of violent methods for the suppression of competing aims becomes even more urgent if we consider that the 
period of Utopian construction is liable to be one of social change In such a time ideas are liable to change also 
Thus what may have appeared to many as desirable at the time when the Utopian blueprint was decided upon may 
appear less desirable at a later date If this is so the whole approach is in danger of breaking down For if we change 
our ultimate political aims while attempting to move towards them we may soon discover that we are moving in 
circles The whole method of first establishing an ultimate political aim and then preparing to move towards it must be 
futile if the aim may be changed during the process of its realization It may easily turn out that the steps so far taken 
lead in fact away from the new aim And if we then change direction in accordance with our new aim we expose 
ourselves to the same risk In spite of all the sacrifices which we may have made in order to make sure that we are 
acting rationally we may get exactly nowherealthough not exactly to that nowhere which is meant by the word 
Utopia 

Again the only way to avoid such changes of our aims seems to be to use violence which includes propaganda the 
suppression of criticism and the annihilation of all opposition With it goes the affirmation of the wisdom and foresight 
of the Utopian planners of the Utopian engineers who design and execute the Utopian blueprint The Utopian 
engineers must in this way become omniscient as well as omnipotent They become gods Thou shalt have no other 
Gods before them 

Utopian rationalism is a selfdefeating rationalism However benevolent its ends it does not bring happiness but only 
the familiar misery of being condemned to live under a tyrannical government 

It is important to understand this criticism fully I do not criticize political ideals as such nor do I assert that a political 
ideal can never be realized This would not be a valid criticism Many ideals have been realized which were once 
dogmatically declared to be unrealizable for example the establishment of workable and untyrannical institutions for 
securing civil peace that is for the suppression of crime within the state Again I see no reason why an international 
judicature and an international police force should be less successful in suppressing international crime that is 
national aggression and the illtreatment of minorities or perhaps majorities I do not object to the attempt to realize 
such ideals 

 

 

Wherein then lies the difference between those benevolent Utopian plans to which I object because they lead to 
violence and those other important and farreaching political reforms which I am inclined to recommend 

If I were to give a simple formula or recipe for distinguishing between what I consider to be admissible plans for social 
reform and inadmissible Utopian blueprints I might say 

Work for the elimination of concrete evils rather than for the realization of abstract goods Do not aim at establishing 
happiness by political means Rather aim at the elimination of concrete miseries Or in more practical terms fight for 
the elimination of poverty by direct meansfor example by making sure that everybody has a minimum income Or 
fight against epidemics and disease by erecting hospitals and schools of medicine Fight illiteracy as you fight 
criminality But do all this by direct means Choose what you consider the most urgent evil of the society in which you 
live and try patiently to convince people that we can get rid of it 

But do not try to realize these aims indirectly by designing and working for a distant ideal of a society which is wholly 
good However deeply you may feel indebted to its inspiring vision do not think that you are obliged to work for its 
realization or that it is your mission to open the eyes of others to its beauty Do not allow your dreams of a beautiful 
world to lure you away from the claims of men who suffer here and now Our fellow men have a claim to our help no 
generation must be sacrificed for the sake of future generations for the sake of an ideal of happiness that may never 
be realized In brief it is my thesis that human misery is the most urgent problem of a rational public policy and that 
happiness is not such a problem The attainment of happiness should be left to our private endeavours 

It is a fact and not a very strange fact that it is not so very difficult to reach agreement by discussion on what are the 
most intolerable evils of our society and on what are the most urgent social reforms Such an agreement can be 
reached much more easily than an agreement concerning some ideal form of social life For the evils are with us here 
and now They can be experienced and are being experienced every day by many people who have been and are 
being made miserable by poverty unemployment national oppression war and disease Those of us who do not 
suffer from these miseries meet every day others who can describe them to us This is what makes the evils 
concrete This is why we can get somewhere in arguing about them why we can profit here from the attitude of 
reasonableness We can learn by listening to concrete claims by patiently trying to assess them as impartially as we 
can and by considering ways of meeting them without creating worse evils 

With ideal goods it is different These we know only from our dreams and from the dreams of our poets and prophets 
They cannot be discussed only proclaimed from the housetops They do not call for the rational attitude of the 
impartial judge but for the emotional attitude of the impassioned preacher 

 

 

The Utopianist attitude therefore is opposed to the attitude of reasonableness Utopianism even though it may often 
appear in a rationalist disguise cannot be more than a pseudorationalism 

What then is wrong with the apparently rational argument which I outlined when presenting the Utopianist case I 
believe that it is quite true that we can judge the rationality of an action only in relation to some aims or ends But this 
does not necessarily mean that the rationality of a political action can be judged only in relation to an historical end 
And it surely does not mean that we must consider every social or political situation merely from the point of view of 
some preconceived historical ideal from the point of view of an alleged ultimate aim of the development of history 
On the contrary if among our aims and ends there is anything conceived in terms of human happiness and misery 
then we are bound to judge our actions in terms not only of possible contributions to the happiness of man in a distant 
future but also of their more immediate effects We must not argue that a certain social situation is a mere means to 
an end on the grounds that it is merely a transient historical situation For all situations are transient Similarly we 
must not argue that the misery of one generation may be considered as a mere means to the end of securing the 
lasting happiness of some later generation or generations and this argument is improved neither by a high degree of 
promised happiness nor by a large number of generations profiting by it All generations are transient All have an 
equal right to be considered but our immediate duties are undoubtedly to the present generation and to the next 
Besides we should never attempt to balance anybodys misery against somebody elses happiness 

With this the apparently rational arguments of Utopianism dissolve into nothing The fascination which the future 
exerts upon the Utopianist has nothing to do with rational foresight Considered in this light the violence which 
Utopianism breeds looks very much like the running amok of an evolutionist metaphysics of an hysterical philosophy 
of history eager to sacrifice the present for the splendours of the future and unaware that its principle would lead to 
sacrificing each particular future period for one which comes after it and likewise unaware of the trivial truth that the 
ultimate future of manwhatever fate may have in store for himcan be nothing more splendid than his ultimate 
extinction 

The appeal of Utopianism arises from the failure to realize that we cannot make heaven on earth What I believe we 
can do instead is to make life a little less terrible and a little less unjust in each generation A good deal can be 
achieved in this way Much has been achieved in the last hundred years More could be achieved by our own 
generation There are many pressing problems which we might solve at least partially such as helping the weak and 
the sick and those who suffer under oppression and injustice stamping out unemployment equalizing opportunities 
and preventing international crime such as blackmail and war instigated by men like gods by omnipotent and 
omniscient leaders All this we might achieve if only we could give up dreaming about distant ideals and fighting over 
our Utopian blueprints for a new world and 

 

 

a new man Those of us who believe in man as he is and who have therefore not given up the hope of defeating 
violence and unreason must demand instead that every man should be given the right to arrange his life himself so 
far as this is compatible with the equal rights of others 

We can see here that the problem of the true and the false rationalisms is part of a larger problem Ultimately it is the 
problem of a sane attitude towards our own existence and its limitationsthat very problem of which so much is made 
now by those who call themselves Existentialists the expounders of a new theology without God There is I believe 
a neurotic and even an hysterical element in this exaggerated emphasis upon the fundamental loneliness of man in a 
godless world and upon the resulting tension between the self and the world I have little doubt that this hysteria is 
closely akin to Utopian romanticism and also to the ethic of heroworship to an ethic that can comprehend life only in 
terms of dominate or prostrate yourself And I do not doubt that this hysteria is the secret of its strong appeal That 
our problem is part of a larger one can be seen from the fact that we can find a clear parallel to the split between true 
and false rationalism even in a sphere apparently so far removed from rationalism as that of religion Christian 
thinkers have interpreted the relationship between man and God in at least two very different ways The sane one 
may be expressed by Never forget that men are not Gods but remember that there is a divine spark in them The 
other exaggerates the tension between man and God and the baseness of man as well as the heights to which men 
may aspire It introduces the ethic of dominate or prostrate yourself into the relationship of man and God Whether 
there are always either conscious or unconscious dreams of godlikeness and of omnipotence at the roots of this 
attitude I do not know But I think it is hard to deny that the emphasis on this tension can arise only from an 
unbalanced attitude towards the problem of power 

This unbalanced and immature attitude is obsessed with the problem of power not only over other men but also 
over our natural environmentover the world as a whole What I might call by analogy the false religion is 
obsessed not only by Gods power over men but also by His power to create a world similarly false rationalism is 
fascinated by the idea of creating huge machines and Utopian social worlds Bacons knowledge is power and 
Platos rule of the wise are different expressions of this attitude which at bottom is one of claiming power on the 
basis of ones superior intellectual gifts The true rationalist in opposition will always be aware of the simple fact that 
whatever reason he may possess he owes to intellectual intercourse with others He will be inclined therefore to 
consider men as fundamentally equal and human reason as a bond which unites them Reason for him is the precise 
opposite of an instrument of power and violence he sees it as a means whereby they may be tamed 

 

 

  
THE HISTORY OF OUR TIME AN OPTIMISTS VIEW 

IN A SERIES of lectures instituted to keep alive the memory of that inspired and successful social reformer 
Eleanor Rathbone it is perhaps not out of place to devote a lecture to a general though tentative assessment of the 
problem of social reform in our time What have we achieved if anything How does our western society compare 
with others These are the questions which I propose to discuss 

I have chosen as the title of my lecture The History of Our Time An Optimists View and I feel that I 
should begin by explaining this title 

When I say History I wish to refer particularly to our social and political history but also to our moral and intellectual 
history By the word our I mean the free world of the Atlantic Communityespecially England the United States the 
Scandinavian countries and Switzerland and the outposts of this world in the Pacific Australia and New Zealand By 
our time I mean in particular the period since  But I also mean the last fifty or sixty yearsthat is to say the 
time since the Boer War or the age of Winston Churchill as one might call it the last hundred yearsthat is in the 
main the time since the abolition of slavery and since John Stuart Mill the last two hundred yearsthat is in the 
main the time since the American Revolution since Hume Voltaire Kant and Burke and to a lesser extent the last 
three hundred yearsthe time since the Reformation since Locke and since Newton So much for the phrase The 
History of Our Time 

Now I come to the word Optimist First let me make it quite clear that if I call myself an optimist I do not wish to 
suggest that I know anything about the future I do not wish to pose as a prophet least of all as a historical prophet 
On the contrary I have for many years tried to defend the view that historical prophecy is a kind of quackery  I do 
not believe in historical laws 

 

 See my Poverty of Historicism  and ch  

 

 

and I disbelieve especially in anything like a law of progress In fact I believe that it is much easier for us to regress 
than to progress 

Though I believe all this I think that I may fairly describe myself as an optimist For my optimism lies entirely in my 
interpretation of the present and the immediate past It lies in my strongly appreciative view of our own time And 
whatever you might think about this optimism you will have to admit that it has a scarcity value In fact the wailings of 
the pessimists have become somewhat monotonous No doubt there is much in our world about which we can rightly 
complain if only we give our mind to it and no doubt it is sometimes most important to find out what is wrong with us 
But I think that the other side of the story might also get a hearing 

Thus it is with respect to the immediate past and to our own time that I hold optimistic views And this brings me 
finally to the word view which is the last word of my title What I shall be aiming at in this lecture is to sketch in a few 
strokes a kind of birdseye view of our time It will no doubt be a very personal viewan interpretation rather than a 
description But I shall try to support it by argument And although pessimists will feel that my view is superficial I 
shall at least try to present it in a way that may challenge them 

And so I begin with a challenge I will challenge a certain belief which seems to be widely held and held in widely 
different quarters not only by many Churchmen whose sincerity is beyond doubt but also by some rationalists such 
as Bertrand Russell whom I greatly admire as a man and as a philosopher 

Russell has more than once expressed the belief I wish to challenge He has complained that our intellectual 
development has outrun our moral development 

We have become very clever according to Russell indeed too clever We can make lots of wonderful gadgets 

including television highspeed rockets and an atom bomb or a thermonuclear bomb if you prefer But we have not 
been able to achieve that moral and political growth and maturity which alone could safely direct and control the uses 
to which we put our tremendous intellectual powers This is why we now find ourselves in mortal danger Our evil 
national pride has prevented us from achieving the worldstate in time 

To put this view in a nutshell we are clever perhaps too clever but we are also wicked and this mixture of 
cleverness and wickedness lies at the root of our troubles 

As against this I shall maintain precisely the opposite My first thesis is this 

We are good perhaps a little too good but we are also a little stupid and it is this mixture of goodness and stupidity 
which lies at the root of our troubles 

To avoid misunderstandings I should stress that when I use the word we in this thesis I include myself 

You may perhaps ask me why my first thesis should be part of an optimists view There are various reasons One is 
that wickedness is even more difficult 

 

 

to combat than a limited measure of stupidity because good men who are not very clever are usually very anxious to 
learn 

Another reason is that I do not think that we are hopelessly stupid and this is surely an optimists view What is wrong 
with us is that we so easily mislead ourselves and that we are so easily led by the nose by others as Samuel Butler 
says in Erewhon I hope you will let me quote from one of my favourite passages It will be seen Butler writes    
that the Erewhonians are a meek and longsuffering people easily led by the nose and quick to offer up common 
sense at the shrine of logic when a philosopher arises among them who carries them away    by convincing them 
that their existing institutions are not based on the strictest principles of morality 

You see that my first thesis although it is directly opposed to such an authority as Bertrand Russell is far from 
original Samuel Butler seems to have thought along similar lines 

Both Butlers formulation of this thesis and my own are somewhat flippant in form But the thesis might be put more 
seriously in this way 

The main troubles of our timeand I do not deny that we live in troubled timesare not due to our moral wickedness 
but on the contrary to our often misguided moral enthusiasm to our anxiety to better the world we live in Our wars 
are fundamentally religious wars they are wars between competing theories of how to establish a better world And 
our moral enthusiasm is often misguided because we fail to realize that our moral principles which are sure to be 
oversimple are often difficult to apply to the complex human and political situations to which we feel bound to apply 
them 

I certainly do not expect you to agree at once either with my thesis or with Butlers And even if you sympathize with 

Butlers you are hardly likely to sympathize with mine Butler you might say was a Victorian But how can I hold the 
view that we do not live in a world of wickedness Have I forgotten Hitler and Stalin I have not But I do not allow 
myself to be overimpressed by them In spite of them and with my eyes open I remain an optimist They and their 
immediate helpers may be set aside in this context What is more interesting is the fact that the great dictators had a 
very large following But I contend that my first thesis or if you like Butlers thesis does apply to most of their 
followers Most of those who followed Hitler and Stalin did so precisely because to use Butlers phrase they were 
easily led by the nose Admittedly the great dictators did appeal to all sorts of fears and hopes to prejudices and to 
envy and even to hatred But their main appeal was an appeal to a kind of morality They had a message and they 
demanded sacrifices It is sad to see how easily an appeal to morality can be misused But it is simply a fact that the 
great dictators were always trying to convince their people that they knew the way to a higher morality 

To illustrate my point I may remind you of a remarkable pamphlet published as recently as  In this pamphlet 
the then Bishop of Bradford attacked a certain form of society which he described as immoral and unChristian and 
of which he said when something is so plainly the work 

 

 

of the devil    nothing can excuse a minister of the Church from working for its destruction The society which in 
the Bishops opinion was the work of the devil was not Hitlers Germany or Stalins Russia it was our own Western 
society the free world of the Atlantic Community And the Bishop said these things in a pamphlet which was written in 
order to support the truly satanic system of Stalin I am absolutely convinced that the Bishops moral condemnation 
was sincere But moral fervour blinded him and many like him to facts which others could easily see for example to 
the fact that countless innocent people were being tortured in Stalins prisons  

Here I am afraid you have an example of a typical refusal to face facts even if they are obvious facts of a typical 
lack of criticism of a typical readiness to be led by the nose to use Butlers words again to be led by the nose by 
anybody who claims that our existing institutions are not based on the strictest principles of morality You have here 
an example of how dangerous goodness can be if too much of it is combined with too little rational criticism 

But the Bishop does not stand alone Some of you may remember an uncontradicted report from Prague in The 
Times about four or five years ago in which a famous British physicist was said to have described Stalin as the 
greatest of all scientists One wonders what this famous physicist will say now that the doctrine of Stalins satanism 
has become if only for the time being an essential component of the party line itself It all shows how astonishingly 
liable we are to be led by the nose if anybody arises who claims to know the way to a higher morality 

The believers in Stalin offer a sad spectacle today But if we admire the martyrs of Christianity we cannot completely 
withhold a reluctant admiration from those who retained their faith in Stalin while being tortured in Russian prisons 
Theirs was a faith in a cause we know to be bad today even party members know it But they believed in it in all 
sincerity 

We see how important this aspect of our troubles is if we remember that the great dictators were all forced to pay 
homage to the goodness of man They were forced to pay lipservice to a morality in which they did not believe 
Communism and nationalism are both believed in as moralities and religions This is their only strength Intellectually 
they border on absurdity 

The absurdity of the communist faith is manifest Appealing to the belief in human freedom it has produced a system 
of oppression without parallel in history 

But the nationalist faith is equally absurd I am not alluding here to Hitlers racial myth What I have in mind is rather 
an alleged natural right of manthe alleged right of a nation to selfdetermination That even a great 
humanitarian and liberal like Masaryk could uphold this absurdity as one of the natural rights of man is a sobering 
thought It suffices to shake ones faith in 

 

 The pamphlet is Christians in the Class Struggle by Gilbert Cole with a Foreword by the Bishop of 
Bradford  Cp my Open Society and its Enemies   and later editions notes  and  to ch  and 
note  to ch  

 

 

the wisdom of philosopher kings and it should be contemplated by all who think that we are clever but wicked rather 
than good but stupid For the utter absurdity of the principle of national selfdetermination must be plain to anybody 
who devotes a moments effort to criticizing it The principle amounts to the demand that each state should be a 
nationstate that it should be confined within a natural border and that this border should coincide with the location of 
an ethnic group so that it should be the ethnic group the nation which should determine and protect the natural 
limits of the state 

But nationstates of this kind do not exist Even Icelandthe only exception I can think ofis only an apparent 
exception to this rule For its limits are determined not by its ethnic group but by the North Atlanticjust as they are 
protected not by the Icelandic nation but by the North Atlantic Treaty Nationstates do not exist simply because the 
socalled nations or peoples of which the nationalists dream do not exist There are no or hardly any homogenous 
ethnic groups long settled in countries with natural borders Ethnic and linguistic groups dialects often amount to 
linguistic barriers are closely intermingled everywhere Masaryks Czechoslovakia was founded upon the principle of 
national selfdetermination But as soon as it was founded the Slovaks demanded in the name of this principle to be 
free from Czech domination and ultimately it was destroyed by its German minority in the name of the same 
principle Similar situations have arisen in practically every case in which the principle of national selfdetermination 
has been applied to fixing the borders of a new state in Ireland in India in Israel in Yugoslavia There are ethnic 
minorities everywhere The proper aim cannot be to liberate all of them rather it must be to protect all of them The 
oppression of national groups is a great evil but national selfdetermination is not a feasible 
remedy Moreover Britain the United States Canada and Switzerland are four obvious examples of states which 
in many ways violate the nationality principle Instead of having its borders determined by one settled group each of 
them has managed to unite a variety of ethnic groups So the problem does not seem insoluble 

Yet in the face of all these obvious facts the principle of national selfdetermination continues to be widely accepted 
as an article of our moral faith and it is rarely challenged outright A Cypriot appealed recently in a letter to The 
Times to this principle He described it as a universally accepted principle of morality The defenders of this 
principle he proudly claimed were defending the sacred human values and the natural rights of man apparently 
even when terrorizing their own dissenting countrymen The fact that this letter did not mention the ethnic minority of 
Cyprus the fact that it was printed and the fact that its moral doctrines remained completely unanswered in a long 
sequence of letters on this subject all go a long way towards proving my first thesis Indeed it seems to me certain 

that more people are killed out of righteous stupidity than out of wickedness 

The nationalist religion is strong Many are ready to die for it fervently believing that it is morally good and factually 
true But they are mistaken 

 

 

just as mistaken as their communist bedfellows Few creeds have created more hatred cruelty and senseless 
suffering than the belief in the righteousness of the nationality principle and yet it is still widely believed that this 
principle will help to alleviate the misery of national oppression My optimism is a little shaken I admit when I look at 
the nearunanimity with which this principle is still accepted even today without any hesitation without any doubt
even by those whose political interests are clearly opposed to it But I refuse to abandon the hope that the absurdity 
and cruelty of this alleged moral principle will one day be recognized by all thinking men 

But let us now leave all these sad stories of misguided moral enthusiasm and turn to our own free world Resisting 
the temptation to offer further arguments in support of my first thesis I will now proceed to my second 

I have said that I am an optimist Optimism as a philosophical creed is best known as the famous doctrine 
elaborately defended by Leibniz that this world of ours is the best of all possible worlds I do not believe that this 
thesis of Leibniz is true But I am sure you will concede me the happy title of optimist when you hear my second 
thesis which refers to our free worldthe Society of the Atlantic Community My second thesis is this 

In spite of our great and serious troubles and in spite of the fact that ours is surely not the best possible society I 
assert that our own free world is by far the best society which has come into existence during the course of human 
history 

Thus I do not say with Leibniz that our world is the best of all possible worlds Nor do I say that our social world is 
the best of all possible social worlds My thesis is merely that our own social world is the best that has ever beenthe 
best at least of which we have any historical knowledge 

I suppose you will by now concede me the right to call myself an optimist But you may perhaps suspect me of being 
a materialistof calling our society the best because it is the wealthiest which history has ever seen 

But I can assure you that this is not the reason why I call our society the best Admittedly I believe it to be a great 
thing to have succeeded or very nearly succeeded in abolishing hunger and poverty But it is neither nylons nor 
nutrition neither terylene nor television which I chiefly admire When I call our social world the best I have in mind 
the very same values which led the former Bishop of Bradford to brand it as the work of the devil only fourteen years 
ago I have in mind the standards and values which have come down to us through Christianity from Greece and from 
the Holy Land from Socrates and from the Old and New Testaments 

At no other time and nowhere else have men been more respected as men than in our society Never before have 
their human rights and their human dignity been so respected and never before have so many been ready to bring 
great sacrifices for others especially for those less fortunate than themselves 

I believe that these are facts 

But before examining these facts more closely I wish to stress that I am very much alive to other facts also Power 
still corrupts even in our world 

 

 

Civil servants still behave at times like uncivil masters Pocket dictators still abound and a normally intelligent man 
seeking medical advice must be prepared to be treated as a rather tiresome type of imbecile if he betrays an 
intelligent interestthat is a critical interestin his physical conditionBut all this is not so much due to lack of good 
intentions as to clumsiness and sheer incompetence And there is much to balance it For example in some countries 
belonging to the free world I am thinking of Belgium hospital services are being most successfully reorganized with 
the obvious aim of making them pleasant rather than depressing places with due consideration for the sensitive and 
for those whose selfrespect may be wounded by practices now prevailing And it is realized there how important it is 
to establish a genuine and intelligent cooperation between doctor and patient and to ensure that a man even a sick 
man should never be encouraged to surrender his final responsibility for himselfBut let us turn to larger problems 
Our free world has very nearly if not completely succeeded in abolishing the greatest evils which have hitherto beset 
the social life of manLet me give you a list of what I believe to be some of the greatest of those evils which can be 
remedied or relieved by social cooperation They are 

Poverty 
Unemployment and some similar forms of Social Insecurity 
Sickness and Pain 
Penal Cruelty 
Slavery and other forms of Serfdom 
Religious and Racial Discrimination 
Lack of Educational Opportunities 
Rigid Class Differences 
War 

Let us see what has been achieved not only here in Great Britain through the Welfare State but by one method or 
another everywhere in the free world 

Abject poverty has been practically abolished Instead of being a mass phenomenon the problem has almost 
become one of detecting the isolated cases which still persist 

The problems of unemployment and of some other forms of insecurity have changed completely We are now faced 
with new problems brought into being by the fact that the problem of massunemployment has largely been solved 

Fairly continuous progress is being made in dealing with the problems of sickness and pain 

Penal reform has largely abolished cruelty in this field 

The story of the successful fight against slavery has become the everlasting pride of this country and of the United 
States 

Religious discrimination has practically disappeared Racial discrimination 

 

 

has diminished to an extent surpassing the hopes of the most hopeful What makes these two achievements even 
more astonishing is the fact that religious prejudices and even more so racial prejudices are probably as widespread 
as they were fifty years ago or very nearly so 

The problem of educational opportunities is still very serious but it is being tackled sincerely and with energy 

Class differences have diminished enormously everywhere In Scandinavia the United States Canada Australia and 
New Zealand we have in fact something approaching classless societies 

My eighth point was war This point I must discuss more fully It may be best to formulate what I have to say here as 
my third thesis 

My third thesis is that since the time of the Boer War none of the democratic governments of the free world has been 
in a position to wage a war of aggression No democratic government would be united upon the issue because they 
would not have the nation united behind them Aggressive war has become almost a moral impossibility  

The Boer War led to a revulsion of feeling in Great Britain amounting to a moral conversion in favour of peace It was 
because of this attitude that Great Britain hesitated to resist the Kaiser and that it entered the first world war only 
after the violation of Belgium It was under its influence that Britain was ready to make allowances for Hitler When 
Hitlers army entered the Rhineland this was undeniably an act of aggression on his part Yet public opinion in this 
country made it impossible for the Government to meet the challengealthough it would have been the most 
reasonable course to take under the circumstances On the other hand Mussolinis open attack on Ethiopia so much 
outraged British public opinion that the HoareLaval plan which wisely tried to keep Mussolini and Hitler apart was 
swept away by an outburst of public indignation 

But a still stronger example is the public attitude towards the issue of preventive war against Russia You may 
remember that around  even Bertrand Russell advocated a preventive war And it must be admitted that there 
were strong reasons in favour of it Russia was not yet in possession of an atomic arsenal and it was the last 
opportunity of preventing Russia from acquiring the hydrogen bomb 

I do not envy the American President his power to decide between such terrible alternatives The one alternative was 
to begin a war The other was to allow Stalin to acquire the power to destroy the world a power with which he 
certainly ought not to have been entrusted Bertrand Russell was no doubt right in maintaining that from a purely 
rational point of view the second alternative was even worse than the first But the decision went the other way An 
aggressive war even in these crucial circumstances and with the then practical certainty of victory had become 
morally impossible 

The free world is still ready to go to war It is ready to go to war against 

 

 This lecture was delivered before the Suez adventure It seems to me that the sad history of this adventure 
supports my first three theses 

 

 

heavy odds as it has done more than once in the past But it will do this only if faced with unambiguous aggression 
Thus as far as the free world itself is concerned war has been conquered 

I have briefly discussed my list of eight great social evils 

I believe that it is most important to say what the free world has achieved For we have become unduly sceptical 
about ourselves We are suspicious of anything like selfrighteousness and we find selfpraise unpalatable One of 
the great things we have learned is not only to be tolerant of others but to ask ourselves seriously whether the other 
fellow is not perhaps in the right and altogether the better man We have learned the fundamental moral truth that 
nobody should be judge in his own cause This no doubt is a symptom of a certain moral maturity yet one may learn 
a lesson too well Having discovered the sin of selfrighteousness we have fallen into its stereotyped inversion into a 
stereotyped pose of selfdepreciation of inverted smugness Having learned that one should not be judge in ones 
own cause we are tempted to become advocates for our opponents Thus we become blind to our own 
achievements But this tendency must be resisted 

When Mr Krushchev on his Indian tour indicted British colonialism he was no doubt convinced of the truth of all he 
said I do not know whether he was aware that his accusations were derived via Lenin largely from British sources 
Had he known it he would probably have taken it as an additional reason for believing in what he was saying But he 
would have been mistaken for this kind of selfaccusation is a peculiarly British virtue as well as a peculiarly British 
vice The truth is that the idea of Indias freedom was born in Great Britain as was the general idea of political 
freedom in modern times And those Britishers who provided Lenin and Mr Krushchev with their moral ammunition 
were closely connected or even identical with those Britishers who gave India the idea of freedom 

I shall always regret that the great British statesman who answered Mr Krushchev had so little to say for himself and 
for our different way of life I am quite sure that he made no impression at all on Mr Krushchev But I think he could 
have done so Had he pointed to the difference between our free world and the communist world by way of the 
following example I am sure Mr Krushchev would have understood him Our statesman might have spoken thus 

The difference between your country and mine can be explained as follows Imagine that my chief Sir Anthony 
suddenly dies tomorrow I can assure you that in our country nobody in his senses would even for a moment consider 
the possibility that I had murdered Sir Anthony Not even a British communist would think so This illustrates the 
simple difference between our respective ways of conducting our affairs It is not a racial difference to be sure for we 
may learn from Shakespeare that not so very long ago we too conducted our affairs in that other manner 

I believe in the importance of answering all those absurd but terrible accusations against Great Britain often 
originating from British sources 

 

 

which are current in the world today For I believe in the power of ideas including the power of false and pernicious 
ideas And I believe in what I might call the war of ideas 

The war of ideas is a Greek invention It is one of the most important inventions ever made Indeed the possibility of 
fighting with words instead of fighting with swords is the very basis of our civilization and especially of all its legal and 
parliamentary institutions And this habit of fighting with words and ideas is one of the few things which still unite the 
worlds on the two sides of the Iron Curtain although on the other side words have only inadequately replaced 
swords and are sometimes used to prepare for the kill To see how powerful ideas have become since the days of 
the Greeks we only need to remember that all religious wars were wars of ideas and that all revolutions were 
revolutions of ideas Although these ideas were more often false and pernicious than true and beneficial there is 
perhaps a certain tendency for some of the better ones to survive provided they find sufficiently powerful and 
intelligent support 

All this may be formulated in my fourth thesis It is as follows 

The power of ideas and especially of moral and religious ideas is at least as important as that of physical resources 

I am well aware of the fact that some students of politics are strongly opposed to this thesis that there is an influential 
school of socalled political realists who declare that ideologies as they call them have little influence upon political 
reality and that whatever influence they have must be pernicious But I do not think that this is a tenable view Were it 
true Christianity would have had no influence on history and the United States would be inexplicable or merely the 
result of a pernicious mistake 

My fourth thesis the doctrine of the power of ideas is characteristic of the liberal and rationalist thought of the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 

But the liberal movement did not believe only in the power of ideas It also upheld a view which I consider mistaken It 
believed that there was little need for competing ideas to join battle This was because it supposed that truth once 
put forward would always be recognized It believed in the theory that truth is manifestthat it cannot be missed once 
the powers which are interested in its suppression and perversion are destroyed 

This important and influential ideathat truth is manifestis one form of optimism which I cannot support I am 
convinced that it is mistaken and that on the contrary truth is hard and often painful to come by This then is my 
fifth thesis 

Truth is hard to come by 

This thesis explains to some extent the wars of religion And although it is a piece of epistemology it can throw much 
light upon the history of Europe since the Renaissance and even since classical antiquity 

Let me now in the time that remains try to give a brief glimpse of this historyof the history of our time especially 
since the Renaissance and the Reformation 

 

The Renaissance and the Reformation may be considered as the conflict between the idea that truth is manifest
that it is an open book there to be read by anybody of good willand the idea that truth is hidden that it is discernible 
only by the elect that the book must be deciphered only by the ministry of the Church and interpreted only by its 
authority 

Although the book meant in the first instance the Bible it subsequently came to mean the book of nature This book 
of nature Bacon believed was an open book Those who misread it were misled by prejudice impatience and 
anticipation If only you will read it without prejudice patiently and without anticipating the text you will not err Error 
is always your own fault It is your own perverse and sinful refusal to see the truth which is manifest before you 

This nave and I believe mistaken view that truth is manifest became the inspiration for the advancement of learning 
in modern times It became the basis of modern rationalism as opposed to the more sceptical classical rationalism of 
the Greeks 

In the field of social ideas the doctrine that truth is manifest leads to the doctrines of individual moral and intellectual 
responsibility and of freedom it leads to individualism and to a rationalist liberalism This doctrine makes the spiritual 
authority of the Church and its interpretation of the truth superfluous and even pernicious 

A more sceptical attitude towards truth on the other hand leads to an emphasis upon the authority of the Church 
and to other forms of authoritarianism For if the truth is not manifest then you cannot leave it to each individual to 
interpret it for this would of necessity lead to chaos to social disintegration to religious schisms and to religious 
wars Thus the book must be interpreted by an overriding authority 

The issue here can be described as one between individualistic rationalism and authoritarian traditionalism 

The issue between rationalism and authoritarian traditionalism can also be described as that between on the one 
hand faith in man in human goodness as well as in human reason and on the other hand distrust of man of his 
goodness and of his reason 

I may confess that in the issue between faith in man and distrust of man my feelings are all on the side of the nave 
liberal optimists even though my reason tells me that their epistemology was all wrong and that truth is in fact hard 
to come by I am repelled by the idea of keeping men under tutelage and authority But I must admit on the other 
hand that the pessimists who feared the decline of authority and tradition were wise men The terrible experience of 
the great religious wars and of the French and Russian revolutions prove their wisdom and foresight 

But although these wars and revolutions prove the cautious wisdom of the pessimists they do not prove them right 
On the contrary I believe that by and large the verdict of historyI mean of course the history of our time favours 
those who had faith in man and in human reason 

 

 

 

For the society of our free world since the Reformation has indeed seen a decline of authority without parallel in any 
other epoch It is a society without authority or as one might call it a fatherless society 

The Reformation by stressing the conscience of the individual has dethroned God as the responsible ruler of Mans 
world God can only rule in our hearts and through our hearts The Protestant believes that it is through his own 
human conscience that God rules the world The responsibility for the world is mine and yours this is the Protestant 
faith and the Bishop of Bradford spoke as a good Protestant when he appealed to his ministers to destroy a social 
world which was the work of the devil 

But the authoritarians and traditionalists were convinced that a nonauthoritarian or fatherless society must spell the 
destruction of all human values They were wise I have said and in a way they were the better epistemologists And 
yet they were wrong For there were other revolutions the Glorious Revolution and the American Revolution And 
there is our present free world our Atlantic Community It is a fatherless society ruled by the interplay of our own 
individual consciences And as I have tried to convince you it is the best society that has ever existed 

What was the mistake of the authoritarians Why must their wisdom be rejected I believe that there are three 
elements in our free world which have successfully replaced the dethroned authority 

The first is our respect for the authority of truth of an impersonal interpersonal objective truth which it is our task to 
find and which it is not in our power to change or to interpret to our liking 

The second is a lesson learnt in the religious wars For I think that in these wars we did learn our lesson we did learn 
from our mistakes though in the social and political field this seems a rare and difficult thing We learnt that religious 
faith and other convictions can only be of value when they are freely and sincerely held and that the attempt to force 
men to conform was pointless because those who resisted were the best and indeed the only ones whose assent 
was worth having Thus we learnt not only to tolerate beliefs that differ from ours but to respect them and the men 
who sincerely held them But this means that we slowly began to differentiate between sincerity and dogmatic 
stubbornness or laziness and to recognize the great truth that truth is not manifest not plainly visible to all who 
ardently want to see it but hard to come by And we learnt that we must not draw authoritarian conclusions from this 
great truth hut on the contrary suspect all those who claim that they are authorized to teach the truth 

The third is that we have also learnt that by listening to one another and criticizing one another we may get nearer to 
the truth 

I believe that this critical form of rationalism and above all this belief in the authority of objective truth is 
indispensable for a free society based on mutual respect This is why it is important not to let our thoughts be 
seriously influenced by such intellectual misunderstandings as relativism and 

 

 

irrationalism the understandable results of disappointment with dogmatism and authoritarianism 

But this critical approach makes room at the same time for a reconciliation between rationalism and traditionalism 
The critical rationalist can appreciate traditions for although he believes in truth he does not believe that he himself 
is in certain possession of it He can appreciate every step every approach towards it as valuable indeed as 
invaluable and he can see that our traditions often help to encourage such steps and also that without an intellectual 
tradition the individual could hardly take a single step towards the truth It is thus the critical approach to rationalism 
the compromise between rationalism and scepticism which for a long time has been the basis of the British middle 
way the respect for traditions and at the same time the recognition of the need to reform them 

What the future will bring us we do not know But the achievements of the past and of our own time show us what is 
humanly possible And they can teach us that although ideas are dangerous we may learn from our mistakes how to 
handle them how to approach them critically how to tame them and how to use them in our struggles including our 
struggle to get a little nearer to the hidden truth 

 

 

  
HUMANISM AND REASON 

THE FIRST of a series of books Studia Humanitatis published in Switzerland is written in 
German by two friends Ernesto Grassi an Italian scholar interested in the Humanist writers of 
the Renaissance and Thure von Uexkll son of the German biologist Jakob von Uexkll 
famous for his Theoretical Biology The book  which deals with The Origin and the Limits of the 
Moral and the Natural Sciences is part of a movement of considerable interest that aims at re
awakening the spirit of the humanists This neohumanist movement is characteristically Central 
European born of the disasters suffered by the Continent during this century and although the 
book under review is not only scholarly but also serene some of its moods and some of the 
conclusions drawn may be difficult to appreciate for those who have no personal knowledge of 
the shattering experience of social disintegration through which it was the lot of these European 
thinkers to live The neohumanist movement is inspired by the conviction shared by a number 
of other movements that it knows both the causes and the cure of the widespread depravity 
and perversion of everything human which Central Europe has had to witness Its message is 
that only the understanding of man and his essential naturehis cultural creativitycan bring 
relief to our ills and it tries as is made clear by Grassi Introductory Remark to take up again 
the task of developing a philosophy of man and of that important human activity science 
Science according to this philosophy is to be reinterpreted as a part of humanism 
consequently a meaning of humanism and of humanistic which confines humanism to the 
humanitiesthat is to historical philological and literary studiesis rejected as too narrow 

The book may thus be said to aim at a new philosophy of man which puts both the humanities 
and the natural sciences in their proper place It consists of two partsOn the Origin and the 
Limits of the Humanities Geisteswissenschaften 

 

 Von Ursprung und Grenzen der Geisteswissenschaften und Naturwissenschaften by E 
Grassi and T von Uexkll Berne  

 

 

schaften   by Grassi and On the Origin of the Natural Sciences by Uexktill The two parts are loosely 
connected by a vague relativistic pragmatism reminiscent of F C S Schiller who also called himself a humanist 
combined with a repudiation of pragmatist views No doubt the authors will disagree with this opinion which they may 
take as proof that the reviewer is incapable of seeing their main point but their various attempts to stress the identity 
of their views appear somewhat forced This however does not diminish the value or the interest either of the whole 
or of its two parts 

The first part Grassis contribution is a philosophical essay on the essence of humanism Its main topic is indicated 
by the German word Bildung often translated by culture which is here understood as the growth the 
development or the selfformation of the human mind and it attempts to reestablish an educational ideal of mental 
growth designed to meet the criticisms raised against the old humanistische Bildungsideal the educational aim 
of the humanities which according to Grassi has become pointless owing to the disappearance of the social and 
cultural traditions in which it was rooted The text on which Grassis neohumanistic sermon is based is a disputation 
concerning the relative merits of legal and medical science C Salutati De nobilitate legum et medicinae 
Written in  it was published in the middle of the fifteenth century a critical edition by E 
Garin was published in  by the Instituto di studi filosofici in Florence Together with 
Petrarchs famous attack on medical men it is perhaps the earliest ancestor of Kant Streit der 
Fakultaeten Grassi takes this as a discussion of the relative merits of the humanities and the 
natural sciences and as a vindication of the claim of the humanities to superiority This 
superiority he says was much better understood at the time when the natural sciences were 
founded than it is today 

The superiority claimed is threefold First it is claimed that the various natural sciences have the 
character of arts in the sense of artes  technai rather than of science or knowledge scientia 
or epistm this means in Salutatis view that they have to take their 
principles corresponding to Bacons middle principles from elsewhere ie from philosophical 
knowledge and that they are therefore logically inferior to those disciplines which establish their 
own principles This view derives from Aristotle and was shared by contemporaries of Salutati 
as well as by later thinkers such as Leonardo Secondly it is claimed with Francis Bacon that 
the natural sciences are arts artes in the sense of techniques or rather technologies  that 
they give us power but such power is not as Bacon thought knowledge for true knowledge 
springs from first principles rather than from secondary or middle principles Thirdly although 
these technologies may be 

 

 The term die Geisteswissenschaften the humanities has become a typical German term and almost 
untranslatable even though it can be literally translated as mental sciences or moral and mental sciences and 
even though it seems to have reached Germany ironically enough through Theodor Gomperzs translation of J 
S Mills expression the Moral Sciences I say ironically enough because the term has in its present German 
usage a strong irrationalist and even antirationalist and antiempiricist flavour but Gomperz and Mill were 
rationalists and empiricists 

 

 

the servants of man and although they may be of some help to him in his ultimate and essential task of furthering his 
mental growth they cannot carry him on to the fulfilment of this task for they inquire into reality only within the narrow 
limits of their particular secondary principles without which their efforts would be pointless 

As opposed to all this legal science which is political science is the science of right and wrong As such it is not only 
useful to man iusa iuvando says Salutafi but useful in an essential sense for it saves his humanity it aims 
at his completion Only by leaving the primitive jungle or bush hl and settling in ordered political communities do 
men transcend the beasts as Protagoras taught This is the first step in their mental growth Bildung and the basis 
of all others and human history is nothing but the success or failure of mandesigned norms enabling community life 
in the political and social spheres to proceed p  

This is by no means a complete outline of Grassis contribution which deals at length with such problems as the 
Aristotelian doctrine that all poetry is imitation with problems of the theory of tragedy especially that of katharsis 
and with the philosophy of time Yet the discussions of these latter topics suffer severely from 
insufficient clarity and coherence they do not in my opinion shed new light on the problems 
discussed even though they contain some interesting asides Outstanding among these are 
Grassis emphasis on imaginative power Phantasie as an essential element in human nature 
and mental growth but his hint pp  that its role in the natural sciences is confined to that 
of tracing out their framework does not appear to me to do justice to them One of the most 
interesting remarks from the educational or selfeducational point of view is contained in 
Grassis analysis of the humanistic conception of mental growth Bildung In trying to interpret 
a literary passage we may discover that in the context in question the words have an unusual 
and even a new meaning This leads us to something new and unexpected An unsuspected 
world opens itself before usand thus we grow und dabei bilden wit uns 

Grassi very fairly concedes that the natural scientists mind can grow in precisely the same way 
when he finds himself compelled to adopt a new interpretation of a natural phenomenon but 
this concession seems to me to destroy his attempt to make use of Salutatis arguments to 
establish the educational priority of the humanities 

Returning to Grassis central claimthe threefold superiority of the humanitiesI admit that the 
natural sciences are in danger of stifling mental growth instead of furthering it if they are taught 
as technologies the same is probably true of painting and of poetry and that they should be 
treated like painting and poetry as human achievements as great adventures of the human 
mind as chapters in the history of human ideas of the making of myths as I have explained 
elsewhere   and of their criticism Neither the possibility of such a humanistic approach to 

science nor the need for it is 

 

 See chs  f of this volume Cf also note  to ch  of my Open Society revised editions 

 

 

mentioned by Grassi on the contrary he seems to believe that salvation lies in the realization and explicit recognition 
of the inferior technological character of the natural sciencesin other words in making them keep their place But 
while I am ready to admit the educational priority of a humanist approach I cannot admit the validity of the Grassi
Salutati theory of the natural sciencesa theory which of course is directly derived from Aristotle That the natural 
sciences have blindly to accept their principles from First Philosophy is a doctrine whose truth I cannot admit in any 
sense Grassi tries to meet this criticism p  by conceding that the natural sciences may question criticize and 
replace their principles an admission which seems to me tantamount to abandoning Salutati and Aristotle and by 
asserting that it is a the aims of science and b the conception of a principle rather than their various 
principles which the various natural sciences must blindly presuppose But this position although not incompatible 
with the Aristotelian view on which Salutatis argument is based is nevertheless completely different from it 

The truth of the matter seems to be this Although medicine happens to be an art a technology it is a mistake to 
conclude that it may be taken as representing the natural sciences for it is an applied rather than a pure science As 
to the latter I agree that natural scienceas opposed to pure mathematics  is not scientia or epistm not 
however because it is a techn but because it belongs to the realm of doxajust like the myths which Grassi 
rightly values so highly The realization that natural science belongs to the realm of doxa but that it was usually 
mistaken until fairly recently for epistm is I believe fertile for understanding the history of ideas Thus Grassis 
central claim that we ought to return to Salutatis superior understanding of the status and significance of the natural 
sciences seems to me unfounded Moreover in Britain at least the Aristotelian view of the matter which Grassi tries 
to reestablish never lost its hold and it is therefore hardly in need of a restatementnot even of one which uses valid 
arguments 

The second part of the book written by Thure von Uexkll is an excitingly original attempt to develop a new theory of 
sciencea biologically orientated epistemology A beautifully clear piece of writing perhaps the best piece of 
contemporary German prose I can recall it introduces us to a new approach to biology a new development of ideas 
which originated with the authors father Jakob von Uexkll 

The fundamental category p  of this approach is that of a biological action Handlung To explain it we may 
perhaps start from the obvious fact that the natural sciences try to describe and explain the behaviour of things under 
various conditions and especially any order or regularity which may be discovered in this behaviour This is true for 
physics chemistry and biology In the biological sciences we are interested in the behaviour of organs tissues cells 
and of course whole organisms The central idea of Uexklls biology is that the most successful way of describing 
the behaviour of a whole organism is in terms of actions which follow certain schematic 

 

patterns or schemata and that these schemata of action and rules of the game may be understood as elaborations 
and modifications of a small number of fundamental schemata and rules This idea appears at first sight attractive if 
not very surprising although one may be inclined to suspend judgment until it has proved its fruitfulness But the 
fruitfulness of the idea is shown I believe by Uexklls brilliant application of it to the problem of the behaviour of the 
parts of the organism organs tissues etc and to a most interesting and truly revolutionary analysis of the 
significance of physical and chemical methods within biology p  

According to Uexklls theory there exists for each kind of organism a definite number of action schemata each of 
which is released by a certain releasesignal Auslser whose nature can be found by experiment by 
constructing an imitative contraption Attrappe dummy These in most cases can be reduced to astonishingly 
simple schematic representation The Viennese biologist Konrad Lorenz found for example that p  certain 
species of geese follow as if it were their mother the first moving object they encounter upon breaking their shells 
and that they continue to do so even when they are confronted by their real mother  For certain other fledglings p 
 the imitative contraption which may replace the parent by operating as a release signal for normal actions 
opening their beaks consists simply of two round pieces of cardboard or sheet metal giving something like a 
generalized silhouette of the head and body of the parent bird With the help of such imitative contraptions we can 
make our entry into the scene of life of some animals It is a moving and even a shattering experience for a sensitive 
mind to realize the strangeness of this world The magical and threatening character of this reality creates an 
impression before which all our old ideas and conception of nature must fail p  Uexklls extension of this 
approach to the problem of tissuereactions and of the use of physical and chemical methods is I can only repeat 
of the greatest interest He suggests that what we actually do in biochemistry is to construct imitative contraptions 
dummies serviceable as release signals for the actions of organs or tissues This I believe is an idea with a great 
future likely to throw much light on some vexed questions I have in mind for example the question of the functional 
equivalence of certain chemical and electrical stimuli in some neuromuscular reactions in the face of even such 
subtle tests as the measurement of endplate potentials Another of the many cases which I think might be used to 
illustrate Uexklls point is a wellknown hypothesis which has been used to explain bacteriostasis the bacteria it is 
suggested absorb a certain chemical which they cannot assimilate mistaking it for food that is the chemical acts 
and is acted upon like a dummy 

All that Uexkll has to say about the application of his ideas to biology is beyond praise I do not know whether his 
theories are true but they are strikingly original They not only have great explanatory power but also the 

 

 See K Z Lorenz King Solomons Ring published in English in  after the present review was first 
published 

 

 

 

power to put familiar things in an entirely new light and one day they may well open a new era in biological thinking 
especially in the fields of physiology and biochemistryprovided of course that the experimentalists take notice of 
these new ideas and their countless applications in almost all fields of biology 

Yet Uexkll speaks in this book not only as a biologist and methodologist of biology but also as a philosopher 

Encouraged perhaps by this successful application Uexkll tries to apply his fundamental categories to the whole 
problem of the theory of knowledge Starting from the Kantian question whether it is possible to know things in 
themselves he discusses the old aspirations of physics to discover the innermost secret of nature itself das 
Innere der Natur and the failure of these aspirations and after an elaborate but I do not think successful 
attempt to determine the role of physics in a world of biological actions he ultimately arrives at a biological ontology
the doctrine that reality which can only be our world a realityforus   is a structure of actions of actions of 
various kinds and various extension p  and he replaces the problem of our knowledge of the world in itself 
by that of our participation in the structure of action which is the world 

Although much of this is reminiscent of certain forms of pragmatism operationalism and instrumentalism it is 
nevertheless one of the most original attempts since Schopenhauer and Bergson to erect a new metaphysical world 
and one capable of accommodating modern science This new attempt commands respect but it does not carry 
conviction On the contrary it seems to me clear that Uexklls theory of knowledge and his ontology are founded 
upon a mistake Anybody acquainted with the pitfalls of idealistic epistemology will have no difficulty in seeing that the 
mistake made must be akin to that of identifying what is with what is known or esse  sciri This lead to Berkeleys 
esse  percipi as well as to Hegels esse  concipi and it now leads a biologist for whom knowledge is rightly a 
kind of action to esse  agi ie to the doctrine that reality is the thing acted upon or the object in the way of 
action or a factorthe situational factorof the schemata of our biological actions 

To be more specific three mistakes may be pointed out in Uexklls argument The first can be found in his analysis 
describing the failure of the aspirations of physics This analysis appears to me to exhibit some typical and popular 
misunderstandings of the theory of relativity It is a mistake to maintain that the relativist universe does not know 
continuous time or continuous space but only islandlike spacetimeconnections and it is a mistake to infer from the 
principle of the equivalence of reference systems the relativization of reality on the contrary relativity teaches both 
the reality and the 

 

 Compare the following remarks made by the older von Uexkll in  in his Theoretical Biology see the 
English translation  p XV the second set of italics is mine All reality is subjective appearance this 
must be the great fundamental admission even of biology     We always come up against objects that owe 
their construction and so presumably their existence to the subject 

 

 

invariance of spatiotemporal intervals Modern physics pace Heisenberg does attempt to give us a picture of the 
universe whether this is drawn well or badly is of course a very different question If we realize this the suggestion 
that we must replace an allegedly dissolving worldview of physics by a new worldview of biology loses much of its 
force 

The second mistake is an extremely interesting one It is made at a point pp  ft where Uexkll blames Lorenz 
for reasoning in a circle and for failing to realize the full consequences of his own and Uexklls new biological 
attitude Lorenz he tells us believes that the action schemata including those of biological experience have 
developed by adapting themselves to the external world by the method of trial and error This vieFw is rejected by 
Uexkll Lorenz he claims fails to grasp the new attitude which is the result of the discovery due partly to Lorenz 
himself that the world around us as it is given to our senses is only the sum total of the biological release signals 
and that it exists therefore only as a factor of the schemata of our biological actions p  Uexkll asserts that 
Lorenzs circular argument is due to his failure to rid himself of the objectivist assumptions upon which the picture of 
the universe of classical physics rests p  

I have no doubt that the accusation of arguing in a circle falls back on Uexkll and that his faulty reasoning is at least 
partly due to his untenable subjectivist interpretation of modern physics For Uexkll overlooks the fact that his whole 
biological analysis presupposes the possibility of a more or less objectivist approach It is only such an approach 
which enables us to speak for example of an imitative contraption taking over the functions of a birds mother It is 
only because we knowin our objective world which goes beyond the birds subjective worldwhat its real mother 
is and what a contraption is that we can say that if animal A differentiates by its actions between its real mother and 
an imitative contraption of a certain kind while animal B does not then A has to that extent the greater powers of 
discrimination or differentiation and is to the same extent better adapted to certain possible environmental 
situations 

Lorenzs view which I have shared for many years   is not only defensible but necessary for understanding the 
peculiar human situationthe phenomenon based on the argumentative use of the human language  of critical 
knowledge as opposed to the uncritical and as it were accidental adaptations of the animals knowledge 

And this brings me to the third mistake in Uexklls argument a mistake which is very hard to understand in one who 
admires Kant It is the gravest mistake of the book and one which both authors share It is their complete and it 
seems almost hostile neglect of human reasonof mans power to grow to transcend himself not only by the 
imaginative invention of myths whose importance is so well emphasized by Grassi but also by the rational criticism 
of his own imaginative inventions These inventions if formulated in some language are from the start 
somewhat different from other

biological actions this may be seen from the fact that each of two schemata of biological actions which otherwise are 
indistinguishable may contain a myth concerning say the origin of the world which is contradictory to the other For 
although some of our beliefs may be immediately relevant to practice others are only remotely relevant to it if at all 
Their differences may make it possible for them to clash and their comparative remoteness may make it possible for 
them to be argued about In this way rational criticism may develop and standards of rationalitysome of the first 
intersubjective standardsand the idea of an objective truth And this criticism may in time develop into systematic 
attempts to discover what is weak and untrue in other peoples theories and beliefs and also in ones own It is by this 
mutual criticism that man if only by degrees can break through the subjectivity of a world of biological release 
signals and beyond this through the subjectivity of his own imaginative inventions and the subjectivity of the 
historical accidents upon which these inventions may in part depend For these standards of rational criticism and of 
objective truth make his knowledge structurally different from its evolutionary antecedents even though it will always 
remain possible to subsume it under some biological or anthropological schema of action It is the acceptance of 
these standards which creates the dignity of the individual man which makes him responsible morally as well as 
intellectually which enables him not only to act rationally but also to contemplate and adjudicate and to discriminate 
between competing theories 

These standards of objective truth and criticism may teach him to try again and to think again to challenge his own 
conclusions and to use his imagination in trying to find whether and where his own conclusions are at fault They 
may teach him to apply the method of trial and error in every field and especially in science and thus they may teach 
him how to learn from his mistakes and how to search for them These standards may help him to discover how little 
he knows and how much there is that he does not know They may help him to grow in knowledge and also to 
realize that he is growing They may help him to become aware of the fact that he owes his growth to other peoples 
criticisms and that reasonableness is readiness to listen to criticism And in this way they may even help him to 
transcend his animal past and with it that subjectivism and voluntarism in which romantic and irrationalist 
philosophies may try to hold him captive 

This is the way in which our mind grows and transcends itself If humanism is concerned with the growth of the 
human mind what then is the tradition of humanism if not a tradition of criticism and reasonableness 

 

 

ADDENDA  
SOME TECHNICAL NOTES 
 Empirical Content 

We arrive at the idea of empirical content as follows By the logical content or the consequence class of a we mean 
the class of all statements which follow from a Thus we may first and tentatively consider calling the empirical 
content of a the class of all observational statements or basic statements see below which follow from a 

But this tentative idea does not work For what interests us most is the empirical content of an explanatory universal 
theory yet from such a theory alone no observational statement follows From All ravens are black we cannot 
derive any observational statement like There is a black raven here now although we can indeed derive the 
statement There is no white raven here now 

This is the reason why in defining empirical content I fell back on the idea that a theory tells us the more 
about observable facts the more such facts it forbidsthat is to say the more observable facts are 
incompatible with it  We then can say that the empirical content of a theory is determined by and equal to the class 
of those observational statements or basic statements which contradict the theory 

A basic statement which contradicts a theory t may be called a potential alsifier of t Using this terminology we can 
say that the empirical content of t consists of the class of its potential falsifiers 

That the name empirical content is justifiably applied to this class is seen from the fact that whenever the measures 
of the empirical contents ECtt  and ECtt   of two empirical ie nonmetaphysical theories t  and t  are 
so related that  ECtt  ECtt   holds the measures of their logical contents will also be so related that  Ct
t    Ctt   will hold and similar relations will hold for the equality of contents 

 

 See LScD sections   This idea has been accepted by Carnap see especially his Logical 
Foundations of Probability  p  and also his Symbolische Logik nd edn  p  

 

 

Proceeding now to the notion of basic statements there is a point in which I wish to improve upon my discussion 
of what I have called basic statements in The Logic of Scientific Discovery see especially sections  
and  I introduced the term basic statement in order to denote a class of statements true or false which in our 
discussion we can assume to be of unquestioned empirical character Unquestioned means here that we are 
prepared to confine the class of basic statements in accordance with the requirements of the most scrupulous and 
exacting empiricist we may be confronted with provided that these requirements are not less exacting than our own 
objectivist minimum requirements These are i basic statements state truly or falsely the existence of observable 
facts occurrences within some sufficiently narrow spatiotemporal region ii The negation of a basic statement will 
not be in general basic In some simple cases of basic statements example There is now a full grown Great Dane in 
my study their negations may be acceptable as basic in most cases of basic statements example There is now a 
mosquito in my study their negations will not be acceptable as basic for obvious reasons iii The conjunction of 
two basic statements is always basic if and only if it is logically consistent Thus whenever a statement and its 
negation are both basic their conjunction will not be basic We may single out from a class of otherwise acceptable 
basic statements those which are not compound relative atomic statements cp LScD section  We can 
then if we like start with these and construct a new class of basic statements from them as follows a We do not 
admit as basic any of the negations of the relative atomic basic statements b We admit as basic all conjunctions of 
basic statements so far as they are consistent Consistency seems intuitively a necessary requirement and its 
adoption greatly simplifies various formulations of the ensuing theory but we might dispense with it as long as we 
exclude inconsistent statements from the class of falsifiers c We do not admit any negation of any compound 
basic statement or any compounds other than conjunctions of basic statements 

These last exclusions may appear somewhat severe but it is not our purpose to admit all empirical statements as 
basicnot even all statements of observable facts I do not mind excluding such compound observation statements 
as There is either a full grown Great Dane or a full grown Shetland Pony in my study from the class of basic 

statements though I should not like to exclude it from the class of empirical statements For although it is our 
intention to insure that all basic statements are obviously empirical we do not intend to ensure the conversethat all 
obviously empirical statements or even all observation statements are basic 

The purpose of the exclusion of negations of basic statements or of negations of almost all basic statements from 
the class of basic statements and of the exclusion from this class of disjunctions and conditionals of basic 
statements is this we do not wish to admit conditional statements such as If there is a raven in this room then it is 
black or If there is a mosquito in this room then it is an anopheles These are no doubt empirical statements 

 

 

but they are not of the character of test statements of theories but rather of instantiation statements and 
therefore less interesting and less basic from the point of view of the theory of knowledge here expounded a theory 
of knowledge which holds the empirical basis of all theories to be tests or in other words attempted refutations 

It might be worth mentioning in this context that the word basic in the term basic statement seems to have misled 
some of my readers My use of the term has a history which is as follows 

Before using the terms basic and basic statement I made use of the term empirical basis meaning by it the class 
of all those statements which may function as tests of empirical theories that is as potential falsifiers In introducing 
the term empirical basis my intention was partly to give an ironical emphasis to my thesis that the empirical basis of 
our theories is far from firm that it should be compared to a swamp rather than to solid ground  

Empiricists usually believed that the empirical basis consisted of absolutely given perceptions or observations of 
data and that science could build on these data as if on rock In opposition I pointed out that the apparent data of 
experience were always interpretations in the light of theories and therefore affected by the hypothetical or 
conjectural character of all theories 

That those experiences which we call perceptions are interpretationsinterpretations I suggest of the total situation 
in which we find ourselves when perceivingis an insight due to Kant It has often been formulated somewhat 
awkwardly by saying that perceptions are interpretations of what is given to us by our senses and from this 
formulation sprang the belief that there must be present some ultimate data some ultimate material which must be 
uninterpreted since interpretation must be of something and since there cannot be an infinite regress But this 
argument does not take into account that as already suggested by Kant the process of interpretation is at least 
partly physiological so that there are never any uninterpreted data experienced by us the existence of these 
uninterpreted data is therefore a theory not a fact of experience and least of all an ultimate or basic fact 

Thus there is no uninterpreted empirical basis and the test statements which form the empirical basis cannot be 
statements expressing uninterpreted data since no such data exist but are simply statements which state 
observable simple facts about our physical environment They are of course facts interpreted in the light of theories 
they are soaked in theory as it were 

As I pointed out in my Logic of Scientific Discovery end of section  the statement Here is a glass of water 
cannot be verified by any observational experience The reason is that the universal terms which occur in this 

statemerit glass water are dispositional they denote physical bodies which exhibit a certain lawlike 
behaviour  

 

 See especially the last paragraph of section  of my LScD 
 LScD section  p  new appendix X  to  pp  See also for example chs  sections iv and v 
and  section  the last six paragraphs of the present volume 

 

 

What has been said here about glass and water holds for all descriptive universals The famous cat on the mat so 
much beloved by empiricists I too find cats endearing is an entity even more highly theoretical than is either glass or 
water All terms are theoretical terms though some are more thoretical than others Breakable is 
more highly theoretical or more highly dispositional than broken but the latter term is also theoretical or 
dispositional as mentioned for example at the end of chapter  above 

This view of the matter makes it possible for us to include into our empirical basis statements containing highly 
theoretical terms provided they are singular statements about observable facts for example statements like Here is 
a potentiometer which reads  or This clock reads  minutes past  That the instrument is in fact a 
potentiometer cannot be finally established or verifiedno more than that the glass before us contains water But it is 
a testable hypothesis and we can easily test it in any physical laboratory 

Thus every statement or basic statement remains essentially conjectural but it is a conjecture which can be easily 
tested These tests in their turn involve new conjectural and testable statements and so on ad infinitum and 
should we try to establish anything with our tests we should be involved in an infinite regress But as I explained in 
my Logic of Scientific Discovery especially section  we do not establish anything by this procedure we 
do not wish to justify the acceptance of anything we only test our theories critically in order to see whether or not 
we can bring a case against them 

Thus our basic statements are anything but basic in the sense of final they are basic only in the sense that they 
belong to that class of statements which are used in testing our theories 

 Probability and the Severity of Tests 

The severity of our tests can be objectively compared and if we like we can define a measure of their severity 

In this definition and also in later discussions in this addendum I shall make use of the idea of probability in the 
sense of the calculus of probability or more precisely of the idea of relative probability 

pxy 

to be read the probability of x given y The idea of absolute probability 

px 

to be read the absolute probability of x will be here taken as defined in terms of relative probability by the explicit 
definition 

DAP pa  pab  cEd pbb  pcd  pab  pac 

Here a abbreviates for every a Ea abbreviates there exists an a  abbreviates if and only if and    
    abbreviates if    

 

 

then    Later we also shall use  as an abbreviation for and In order to interpret DAP intuitively we may 
choose for d the negation of c 

The idea of relative probability 

pxy 

will be used here mainly as a definiens as in DAP It can in its turn be defined implicitly through an axiom 
system such as the one given in my Logic of Scientific Discovery new appendices iv and v  The six 
axioms there given may be reduced to three one of them A an existential axiom and two B and C axioms in the 
form of creative   definitions 

A EaEbpab  pbb 

that is there are at least two different probabilities 

Axiom A may be replaced by A EaEbpab   

which is weaker since it is for example compatible with the formula abpab   a formula which contradicts 
both axioms A and C 

B dpabd  pcd  efpab  pcb  pae  pce  pbc  pbe  pfe  pbf  pff  
pef  pafpbe  pce 

Axiom B defines the product ab read aandb in terms of pxy 

C pab  pbb  pab  Ecpbb  pcb 

Axiom C defines the complement a read nona in terms of pxy 

To these three axioms we may add three noncreative or ordinary definitions of absolute probability pa defined 

above by DAP of the Boolean identity a  b and of ntermed independence relative to b 

Ind n a  a     a n  b 

Identity is defined as follows 

D a  b  cpac  pbc 

ntermed independence relative to b can be defined in various ways for example by the following explicit definition 
which amounts to a set of n  n   equations 

D  Ind Ind n a     anb if and only if the following holds 

i    k    m  i      k      m      n   pa ma i   a k b  pa mb 

This gives rise to the following equivalent recursive definition 

D  Ind i Ind  a  b for every a  and for every b ii Ind n a     a n b if and only if a Ind n a 
    a n b b i    k  i      k      n   pa n  a i   a k b  pa n b 

 

 See especially LScD pp   and  also British Journal for the Philosophy of Science  
 pp  f 
 For a discussion of creative and noncreative definitions see for example P Suppes Introduction to Logic 
 p  and also my forthcoming paper Creative and NonCreative Definitions in the Calculus of 
Probability 

 

 

More interesting for various reasons is the following equivalent recursive definitionD  Ind i as before ii a as 
before b Ind n a     a n a n   b c i  i  n  pa ia n   b  pa ib These definitions may be 
strengthened for an infinitist theory it may be appropriate for example to insert in c before the last bracket pa 
n  a i b  pa n  b that is an equation which is derivable from c only under the assumption that pa ib  
Now we can turn to the definition of the severity of tests in terms of pxyLet h be the hypothesis to be tested let e 
be the test statement the evidence and b the background knowledge that is to say all those things which we 
accept tentatively as unproblematic while we are testing the theory b may also contain statements of the character 
of initial conditions Let us assume to start with that e is a logical consequence of h and b this assumption will 
later be relaxed so that pehb   For example e may be a statement of a predicted position of the planet Mars 
derived from Newtons theory h and our knowledge of past positions which forms part of bWe then can say that if 
we take e as a test of h then the severity of this test interpreted as supporting evidence will be the greater the less 
probable is e given b alone without h that is to say the smaller is peb the probability of e given bThere are in 

the main two methods  of defining the severitySebof the test e given b Both start from the measure of 
content Ct The first takes the complement of probability as a measure of content Ct 
  Cta    pa the second takes the reciprocal of probability as a measure of content 
  Cta  pa The first suggests a definition like Seb    peb or better 
  Seb    peb    peb that is to say it suggests that we measure the severity of the test by Ct or 

better by something like a normalized Ct using     peb as a normalizing factor The second 
suggests that we measure the severity of the test simply by its content Ct 
Seb  Cteb  peb 

 
 

 See LScD note  to section  p  

 

 

We may now generalize these definitions by relaxing the demand that e logically follows from h and b or even the 
weaker demand that 

pehb   

Instead we now assume that there is some probability pehb which may or may not be equal to  

This suggests that in order to obtain a generalization of  and  we substitute in both these formulae the more 
general term pehb for  We thus arrive at the following generalized definitions of the severity of the test e 
interpreted as supporting evidence of the theory h given the background knowledge b 

Sehb  pehb  peb pehb  peb 

Sehb  pehb peb 

These are our measures of the severity of tests qua supporting evidence There is little to choose between them 
since the transition from the one to the other is orderpreserving  that is to say the two are topologically invariant 
The same holds if we replace the measures Ct and S by their logarithms  for example by logCt nd by logSin 
order to make these measures additive 

Having defined a measure of the severity of our tests we can now use the same method to define the explanatory 
power of the theory h Eheb and if we like in a somewhat similar way the degree of corroboration  of h with 
respect to e in the presence of b 

Eheb  Sehb 

Eheb  Sehb 

These definitions indicate that the explanatory power of a theory h with respect to some explicandum e is the 
greater the more severe is e if taken as test of the theory h 

It can now be shown quite easily that the maximum degree of the explanatory power of a theory or of the severity of 
its tests depends upon the informative or empirical content of the theory 

Thus our criterion of progress or of the potential growth of knowledge will be the increase of the informative content 
or the empirical content of our theories and at the same time the increase of their testability and also their 
explanatory power with respect to known and as yet unknown evidence 

 Verisimilitude 

In this section the ideas of sections x and xi of chapter  which are here taken as read are further discussed and 
developed 

In Tarskis theory of truth truth is a property of statements We may 

 
 See LScD p  
 Ibid pp  
 Ibid pp  

 

 

take T to denote the class of all true statements of some more or less artificial language object language see 
section  below And we may by 

a  T 

express the assertion of some metalanguage that the statement a is a member of the class of true statements or in 
other words that the statement a is true 

Our first task here is to define the idea of the truthcontent of a statement a which we denote by Ct T a It will 
have to be defined in such a way that a false statement as well as a true one has a truthcontent 

If a is true then Ct T a the truthcontent of a or rather its measure will be simply the measure of the content of 
a that is 

a  T  Ct T a  Ct a 

where we may as in section   put 

Cta    pa 

If a is false it may still as suggested have a truthcontent For assume that today is Monday Then the statement 
Today is Tuesday will be false But this false statement will entail a number of true statements such as Today is not 
Wednesday or Today is either Monday or Tuesday and the class of all those true statements which it entails will be 
its logical truthcontent In other words the fact that every false statement entails a class of true statements is the 
basis for ascribing a truthcontent to every false statement 

We therefore shall define the logical truthcontent of the statement a as the class of statements which belong 
to both the logical content of a and to T and we interpret the measure of its truth content Ct T a 
accordingly 

In order to give a definition of the idea of Ct T a within the theory of content Ct or of probability p where Cta    
pa various methods are open to us 

The simplest method is perhaps to agree that in expressions like pa or pab the letters a b etc may not only 
be names of statements and thus for example of conjunctions of a finite number of statements but also names of 
classes of statements or of the finite or infinite conjunctions of all statements which are members of these classes 
We then agree to use in place of T the symbol t  in contexts like pt or pat or ptb and to operate with t 
exactly as if it were the finite or infinite conjunction of all true statements of the language system or system of 
statements under consideration In other words we use the symbol t as one of the constant values which may be 
taken up by our variables a b etc and agree to use it in such a way that 

The consequence class or logical content of t is T 

Next we define a new symbol a T  by the definition 

a T  a v t 

 
 Note that we do not use here t for tautology for which we shall later introduce the symbol tautol 

 

 

As a result of this definition we have using  for entails or from    follows    

a  a T 

and therefore also 

paa T   pa 

paa T pa T   paa T   pa 

We also have 

a T  x if and only if a  x  x  T 

where a  b again reads b is deducible from or entailed by a Thus  means that a T is the logically strongest 
true statement or deductive system entailed by a Thus we can now define the truthcontent of a as the 
content of a T  and its measure Cr T a can now be defined as follows 

Cr T a  Cta T     pa T  

It follows from  and  that 

Ct T a Cta 

and 

If a  T then a T  a and Ct T a  Cta 

In order to define  Vsathat is a measure of the verisimilitude of awe need not only the truthcontent of a but 
also its falsitycontentor a measure of itsince we wish to define Vsa as something like the difference of the truth
content and the falsitycontent of a But the definition of a falsitycontent of a or something to serve in its place is 
not quite simple owing to the fundamental fact that while T can be said to form a consequence class or content the 
content of t see  above the class F of all false statements of our system is not a consequence class For 
while T contains all the logical consequences of Tsince the logical consequence of anything true must also be true
F does not contain all its logical consequences while from a true statement only true statements follow from a false 
statement follow not only false statements but always true statements also 

As a result of this a definition of falsitycontent on lines analogous to truthcontent appears not to be workable 

In order to arrive at a satisfactory definition of Ct F a the measure of the falsitycontent of a it will be useful to lay 
down a number of desiderata 

i a  T  Ct F a   

iii a  F  Ct F a Cta 

iii Ct F a Cta  

iv Ct F contrad  Ctcontrad   

where contrad is a name of a selfcontradictory statement Desideratum iv should be compared and contrasted 
with the theorem 

Ct T tautol  Cttautol   

where tautol is a name of a tautological statement 

 

 

Ct T a    Ct F a  Cta 

Ct F a    Ct F a  Cta  

Ct T a  Ct F a  Cta 

the reason for putting here  rather than  will be seen if we take a to be for example contrad for in this case 
we obtain 

Ct F a  Cta   

and 

Ct T a  Ctt  

by iv 

but Ctt is the maximum truthcontent which will in general be different from zero In an infinite universe Ctt 
   pt will as a rule be equal to  

Ct F and Ct T are symmetrical with respect to Ct in the following sense there exist two functions f  and f  such 

that 

Ct T a  Ct F a  Cta  fCt T a Ct F a 

 Cta  fCt F a Ct T a 

that is to say f  is symmetrical with respect to Ct T and Ct F  so that as a consequence we get 

Ct T a  f  Cta Ct F a 

Ct F a  f  Cta Ct T a 

Among the various possibilities of defining Ct F a on these lines the following definition recommends itself and will 
be adopted here 

Ct F a    paa T   Cta a T  

This definition satisfies our desiderata This is obvious for the desiderata i and ii and it becomes clear for the 
rest if we consider the following theorems 

Ct F a pa T   pa T   paa T  pa T   pa T   pa  Cta  Ct T a 

see  

so that 

Ct T a  Cta  Ct F a pa T   Cta 

Ct F a  Cta  Ct T a pa T  Ct F a  Ct T aCt T a 

Ct T a paa T   paa T   pa T  paa T   paa T   pa  Cta  Ct F a 

Thus we obtain 

Ct F a  Cta  Ct T a paa T   Cta 

Ct T a  Ct a  Ct F a paa T   Ct T a  Ct F a   Ct F a 

see iii 

see  

 

 

We also obtain from  

CtFa  Ct T a Ct F a  Cta  Ct T a 

and thus 

Ct T a  Ct F a  Cta  Ct T a Ct F a 

Thus  shows that iii is satisfied and  shows that v vi vii and viii are satisfied The satisfaction of iv 
follows from pcontrad t   

This shows that the proposed definition  of Ct F a satisfies all our desiderata Yet one of our desiderata 
vii may perhaps appear unsatisfactory it may perhaps appearin spite of our comment on viithat we should 
have postulated that 

 Ct T a  Ct F a  Cta 

It can be shown that the equation  would indeed determine Ct F  it would lead to the definition which we shall not 
adopt 

Ct F a  Cta T  a    pa T  a 

where a T  a or as we can also write a  a T  is the conditional statement if a T then a or a if a T  

It is of interest to compare this definition with our  or in other words to compare Cta  a T  with Cta a T  
the latter being our Ct F a or to compare pa aT with pa a T  

We have to be sure 

Ct T a  Ctaa T   Cta 

and this appears at first sight satisfactory 

But let us substitute contrad for a 

Ct T contrad  Ctt    pt 

which as we have seen is the maximal truthcontent obtainable in our system and since Ctcontrad  we obtain 

for Ctaa T   Ctcontradt    pcontrad v t pt Now while CtTcontrad  Ctt would be quite 
unobjectionableit is a clear consequence of a satisfactory definition of Ct T a and of the fact that everything and 
therefore t follows from a selfcontradictory statementthis is not so with Ct F contrad  pt for this would allow 
in most cases the falsitycontent of a contradiction to be smaller than its truthcontent while we should expect the 
falsitycontent of a contradiction to be at least equal to its truthcontent 

To take an example let our universe of discourse be a throw of a die let t be three turned up and let pt be  
The proposed but here rejected definition of Ct F a  Ctaa T  would lead in this universe to the result that the 
falsitycontent of a contradictory statement such as six will turn up and will not turn up Ct F contrad would be 
equal to  while its truthcontent Ct T contrad would be equal to  Thus the truthcontent of a contradictory 
statement would greatly exceed the falsitycontent which is clearly counterintuitive This is the reason for adopting 
our desideratum iv and this desideratum leads to cases in which Ct T a  Ct F aCta 

 

 

It will be seen from all this that our desideratum iv might be replaced by the following two highly intuitive ones 

vi a 

Ct F contrad  constant 

vi b 

Ct F contrad  Ct T contrad 

Incidentally the fact that we have quite generally 

Ct F a  Ctaa T   Ct F aCt T a 

may appear somewhat surprising Yet it is an immediate consequence of the following more general formula 

pab  pa b  CtabCtb 

a formula which I derived many years ago in order to show that the absolute probability of the one conditional 
statement a if b or of the statement if b than a exceeds in general the relative probability of some statement a 
given some other statement b 

Formula  thus compares as it were the arrow to the left  with the comma  and calculates the never 
negative excess

of the conditional probability over the relative probability 

Having defined the measures of truthcontent and of falsitycontent we may now proceed to define the Vsa the 
verisimilitude of a As long as we are merely interested in comparative values we could use 

Ct T a  Ct F a  paa T   pa T  

as definiens If we are interested in numerical values then it becomes preferable to multiply this by a normalizing 
factor and to use pa a T   pa T   pa a T  pa T  as definiens For we wish the following desiderata to 
be satisfied 

Vsa T Vsb  Ct T a  Ct F a    Ct T b  Ct F b 

  Vsa  Vst   

Vs tautol   

Vs contrad    

so that we get 

  Vscontrad  Vsa    

In an infinite universe in which Ctt may become  Vs t should be able to become  also 

It should be noted here that Ctt   pt will depend upon the choice of our universe of discourse Even in a 
potentially infinite universe it may be less than  as the following example shows let our universe contain a 
denumerably infinite set of exclusive possibilities a  a     and let pa     pa     pa     pa 
n   n let moreover just one of these possibilities be realized t  a   then Ctt   

 

 

It is thus preferable to replace for purposes of numerical calculations paaT  paT by a normalized form we 
choose the normalizing factor   paaT  paT that is to say we define as indicatedVsa  paaT  paT  p
aaT  paTWe obtainIf a  T then Vsa  CtTa  paT  Cta  paVstautol  andVscontrad   
There are various other possible definitions For example we might introduce other normalizing factors such as CtT
a or Cta or CtTa  CtFa These would not I think lead to adequate definitions of Vsa but rather to 
definitions of such ideas as say degree of truthvalue 
Numerical Examples 
Before discussing some numerical exampleswhich have to be taken from theories which apply probability to games 
of chance or from statistical theoriesI wish to make some general remark about numerical values in pure 
theories of content and probabilityApart from those applications of probability theory in which we can 
measure probabilities in the usual way with the help of either the assumption of equal probabilities as in dicing or 
with the help of statistical hypotheses I see no possibility of attaching numerical values other than  and  to our 
measures of probability or content Pure probability theory and pure content theory are in this respect like Euclidean 
geometry there is no actual unit defined in Euclidean geometry The definition of the Paris unitmeter is decidedly 
extrageometrical There is no need to worry if pure probability theory or content theory do not supply us with actual 
numerical values except  and  Their status is thus in many respects more like topology than metrical geometry 
 Turning now to numerical examples I shall distinguish two kinds 
i 

Examples of the type of ordinary dicing Here if say  turns up while our guess was that  would turn up we 
consider this as no better or worse a guess than say the guess that  will turn up Better or worse are here 
used in the sense of nearer to or further from the truth 
Examples in which we have a kind of measure of the distance of our guesses from the truth We can 
represent this by the assumption that if in fact  turns up the guess or the proposition that  will turn up or 
that  will turn up is separated from the truth by the proposition that  will turn up 

ii 

 
 The theory of probability here presupposed is developed in LScD appendices iv and v see also the second 
section of the present addendum above 

 

 

or that  will turn up and that for this reason if a   aT will be  v  v  rather than  v  or alternatively 
aT   v  v   

Here and in what follows a   or a   v  is used to express a   will turn up or a   or  will turn up etc 

We assume homogeneous dice 

I shall first calculate three examples of type i 

a   b   b  t 

We have aT   v  paaT   paT   Vsa   

a   b   b  t 

We have aT   v  The calculation and the result are the same as in case  

a   v  b   b  t 

We have aT   v  v  paaT   paT   Vsa   

We can now compare these with three corresponding examples of type ii The difference lies in the calculation of 
aT 

a   b   b  t 

We have aT   v  v  paaT   paT   Vsa    

a   b   b  t 

We have aT   v  paaT   paT   Vsa   

a   v  b   b  t 

We have aT   v  v  pa aT   paT   Vsa   

I add two examples of true guesses 

a   b   b  t Vsa   

a   v  b   b  t Vsa   

Thus we see that verisimilitude can increase with the content of a and decrease with the probability of a 

Artificial vs Formalized Languages 

It has often been said that Tarskis theory of truth is applicable only to formalized language systems I do not believe 
that this is correct Admittedly 

 
  v  v  and  v  is here shorthand for either  or  or  will turn up and either  or  will turn up 

 

 

 

 

it needs a languagean objectlanguagewith a certain degree of artificiality and it needs a distinction between an 
objectlanguage and a metalanguagea distinction which is somewhat artificial But although by introducing certain 
precautions into ordinary language we rob it of its natural character and make it artificial we do not necessarily 
formalize it although every formalized language is artificial not every language which is subject to some stated rules 
or based on more or less clearly formulated rules and which is therefore artificial need be a fully formalized 
language The recognition of the existence of a whole range of more or less artificial though not formalized languages 
seems to me a point of considerable importance and especially important for the philosophical evaluation of the 
theory of truth
