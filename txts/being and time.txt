TRANSLATORS  PREFACE 

MoRE than thirty years have passed since Being and  Time first appeared 
and it has now become perhaps the most celebrated  philosophical 
which Germany has produced in this century It is a very difficult book 
even for the German reader and highly resistant 
so that it has often been called untranslatable 
exaggeration 

to translation 
so much 
We feel that  this 
is an 

work 

though impracticable 

expressions 

linguistic 

con

Anyone who has struggled 

the new version into the very words 

has ascribed to him In this respect 

work in translation 
has 
found himself asking how the author himself would have 

with a philosophical 

would perhaps be one so constructed 

Everybody knows that this is altogether 

that a reader 
competence and a key to the translators 

the ideas which the translator 
translation 

too much to 
must at least keep this ahead of him 
goal The simplest 

constantly 
expressed 
the ideal 
with reasonable 
ventions should be able to retranslate 
of the original 
demand but the faithful translator 
compromise with 
as a desirable 
and the 
the demands of his own langugage is to present the translation 
text on opposite pages he is then quite free to choose the most 
original 
he can think of trusting that the reader who is 
felicitous 
shrewd enough to wonder what is really happening can look across and 
find out Such a procedurewould add enormouslyto the expense of a book 
as long as Being ana Time and is impracticable 
But on 
any page of Heidegger there is a great deal happening 
that we owe it to the reader to let him know what is going on For the 
benefit of the man who already has a copy of the German text we have 
indicated 
which differs only slightly 
marked with H refer to this pagination 
have the German text handy we have had to use other devices 

of the later German editions 
from that of the earlier ones All citations

But for the reader who does not 

for other reasons 

and we have felt 

and a great part of his merit lies in the freshness 

As long as an author is using words in their ordinary ways the trans
lator should not have much trouble in showing what he is trying to say 
But Heidegger is constantly 
using words in ways which are by no means 
ordinary 
tion which his very innovations 
traditional 
lary of his own He occasionally 
and he takes full advantage of the ease with which the German language 
lends itself to the formation of new compounds He also uses familiar 

reflect He tends to discard much of the 

coins new expressions

to avoid personal constructions

sentences 
Aristotle 
makes an innovation 
it but sometimes he will have 
used a word in a special sense many times before he gets round to the 
explanation 
and he may often use it in the ordinary senses as well In 
such cases the reader is surely  entitled

he likes to talk about his words and seldom

When Heidegger uses italics 
earlier ones we have generally 
where we have felt that some emphasis of our own is needed we have 
resorted to wide spacing We have not followed Heidegger in the use of 
italics 
to 
introduce restrictive 
practice

Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really 
 Not at all So it is fitting that we should

of the meaning 

mean by the word being 
raise anew the question 
perplexed 
at our inability 
all So first of all we must reawaken an understanding 
this question 
of the meaning of Being and to do so concretely 
is the Interpretation

the German word in brackets or

seiend must be distinguished 

either by the infinitive 

from the important substantive 

Sein always capitalized 

as Being capitalized 

and from the equally important sub

derived from seiend 

and which we shall usually 

See our note  H  below 

 Sinn In view of the importance of the distinction 

between Sinn and Bedeutung 
in German writers as diverse as Dilthey Husser Frege and Schlick we shall translate 
Sinn by meaning or sense 
depending on the context and keep signification

which are more theoretical

Throughout this work the word horizon 
from that to which the Englishspeaking 
think of a horizon as something which we may widen or extend or go beyond Heidegger 
however seems to think of it rather as something which we can neither widen nor go 
beyond but which provides the limits for certain intellectual

It is said that Being is the most universal

Seiendes 

 The word Seiendes 

       was einer am  Seienden erfasst 

which Heidegger uses 
is one of the most important words in the book The substantive 

see note  p tg and means literally 
which is There is much to be said for 
by the noun being or beings for it is often used in a collective 

in his paraphrase 
Seiende is derived from the participle 
seiend 
that which is ein Seiendes means sometling 
translating 
sense We feel however that it is smoother and less confusing 
or en

INT I 
except that he no longer pays heed to Aristotles 
Being as over against the multiplicity 
things So if it is said that Being is  the most universal 
cannot mean that it is the one which is clearest 
discussion 

It is rather the darkest of all 

of categories 

problem of the unity of 
to 

applicable 
concept this 

or that it needs no further

 It has been maintained secondly that the concept of Being is  
and rightly 

This is deduced from its supreme universalitytv 
fit per genus proximum 

indefinable 
so if definitio 
natura nor can it 
indeed be conceived as an entity enti non additur 
to it 
acquire such a character as to have the term entity  applied 
Being cannot be derived  from 
nor can 
it be presented through lower ones But does this imply that Being no 
longer offers a problem Not at all We can infer only that Being cannot 
have the character 
Thus we cannot apply to Being the concept 
ofdefinition 
logic which itself has its founda
tions in ancient ontology and which within certain limits provides a 
quite justifiable

does not eliminate 
the question of its meaning it demands that we look 
that question in the face

The indefinability 

in traditional 

as presented 

of an entity 

 Thirdly it is held that Being is of all concepts the one that is self

Whenever one cognizes anything or makes an assertion whenever 

even towards oneself  some use 
is held to be intelligible 

without

and the like But here we have an average kind of intelligibility 
merely demonstrates 
any  way of comporting oneself towards entities 
Being towards entities 
fact that we already live in an understanding 
ing of Being is still veiled in darkness proves that it is necessary 
to raise this question again 

which 
It makes manifest that in 
as entitieseven 
in any 
an enigma  The very 

that this is unintelligible 

of Being and that the mean

as entitiesthere 

lies a priori

Within the 

rangeofbasic philosophical 

conceptsespecial

lywhen we come 

to the concept ofBeingit

Kants covert 

is a dubious procedure to invoke selfevidence 

judgments of the common reason  

      in jedem Verhalten zu Seiendem in jedem Sichzusichselbstverhalten 

  
The verb verhalten 
can refer to any kind of behaviour or way of conducting onestlf 
even to the way in which one relates oneself to something else or to the way one reframs 
or holds oneself back We shall translate 

it in various ways 

 Sie macht offenbar dass in jedem Verhalten und Sein zu Seiendem als Seiendem a 

priori ein Ratselliegt 
in which the substantive 
we shall usually translate 
towards Others Being towards entities 

The phrase Sein zu Seiendem is typical of many similar expressions 
zu In such expressions 
for example Beingtowardsdeath 

Sein is followed by the preposition

By considering 

these prejudices 

however we have made plain not only 
that the question of Being lacks an answer but that the question itself is 
obscure and without direction

we must first work out an adequate way offormulati

In the question of the meaning of Being there is no circular reasoning 

or forward which what 
as a mode ofBeing

we are asking about Being bears to the inquiry itself 
of an entity Here what is asked about has an essential

inquiry itself and this belongs to the ownmost meaning  eigensten 
of the question of Being This only means however that there is a way
perhaps even a very special onein  which 
of

The question of Being aims therefore at ascertaining

Dasein is ontically

that with and

Here we have merely indicated  provisionally

In contrast to all this our treatment of the question of the meaning of 
of all ontology is 
and we 
of time if rightly seen and rightly explained 

Being must enable us to show that the central 
rooted in 
the phenomenon 
must show how this is the case

If Being is to be conceived in  terms of time and 

and derivations 

are to become intelligible 

by taking time into consideration 

modes and derivatives 
modifications 
Being itself and not merely entities 
thus made visible in its temporal 
can no longer mean simply being in time Even the nontemporal 
the supratemporal 
just privatively

Whether the answer is a  new one remains quite superficial

that 
is  blind 
The answer is not properly conceived if what it 
asserts proposidonally is just passed along especially

gets brought forth das Hervorgebrachte and  that which announces itself

that senses a and b are  the proper senses of mere appearance On H  and  he 
concedes that sense b corresponds

INT II 

Being and Time 
In spite of the fact that appearing 

is never a showingitself in the sense 

 

gitself 

we allude to 

only by reason of a showingitself 

something wherein something appears 

one has not thereby  defined  the 

is not the appearing itself Appearing is an announcin

 which helps to make possible the 
 das 

of phenomenon appearing is possible 
of something 
But this showingitself
appearing 
Sichmelden through something that shows itself If one then says that with 
the word appearance 
without being itself an appearance 
concept of phenomenon one has rather presupposed it This presupposition 
however remains concealed for when  one says this sort 
of thing about 
appearance
in two  ways That 
 the expression 
wherein something appears 
itself and therefore does not show itself 
being itself an appearance 
But this showingitself 
thing announces itself According to this phenomena 
though on the other hand every appearance 
If one defines phenomenon 
which is still unclear 
of phenomenology 

 means that wherein something announces 
without 

is dependent on phenomena 
ofappearance 

is stood on its head and a critique 

signifies the showingitself 

on this basis is surely a remarkable 

and in the words  Rede 

belongs  essentially 

to the wherein 

are never appearances 

appear  gets  used 

 appearance 

then everything 

with the aid 

of a conception 

in which some

 

undertaking 
itself can have a double signifi

So again the expression 

appearance 

in the sense of announcingitself 

as notshowing

that which does the announcing das Meldende selbst
something which does not show 

and next 

cation  first appearing 
itself 
that which in its showingitself 
itself And finally  one 
sense of phenomenon as showingits
different things as appearance bewilderment 

indicates 

can  use appearing as  a term for  the genuine 
these three 

elf If one designates 

is unavoidable 

But this bewilderment 

is essentially increased 

by the fact that appear
on That which does the announc

lf indicates 

something nonmanifest

ance can take on still another significati
ingthat which in its showingitse
may be taken as that which emerges in what is itself nonmanifest and 
which emanates ausstrahlt 
from it in  such a way indeed that the non
manifest gets thought of as something that is essentially 
When that which does the announcing is 
is tantamount to a bringing forth or something 
brought forth but 
something which does not make up the real Being of what brings it forth 
ce That 
here we  have an appearance in  the sense of mere  appearan
course show 
which does the announcing 
itself 
and in such  a way that as an emanation of what it announces 
it keeps 
this very thing constantly 
showing which veils is not a semblance 
in this twofold way  According 

veiled in itself On  the other hand this not

C The Preliminary 

Conception of Phenomenology 

concretely 
and logos 

When we envisage 

what we have set forth in our Interpreta

we are struck by an inner relationship 

tion of phenomenon 
between the things meant by these terms The expression 
phenomen
ology may be formulated in Greek as Myw Ta cpalvofVa 
where 
Mynv means arrocpalvua 
Ta cpawJLVato 
in which it showsitselff
of research 
nothing 

rom itself This is the formal meaning of that branch 

let thatwhichshowsitselfbeseenfromitselfin 

else than the maxim formulated 

above To the things themselves  

Thus phenomenology 

phenomenolog

which calls itself 

the very way 

y But here we are expressing 

means arrocpalvua 

Thus the term phenomenology 

is quite different in its meaning froni 
the 

telling 

activities 

expressions 

that which is laid out exhibited  set 

 Heidegger is here pointing  out  that 

such as theology 

and the  like  Those 
the word ilos is etymologically 

terms designate 
akin  to  the 
verb Uym which has among its numerous meanings those of laying out exhibiting 
a tau  malcing a statement Thus ilyos as illynv can be thought of 
forth recounting 
But iloyos can 
as the faculty ofreason Vernunft which makes  such 
also mean rei ileyollov

it is the underlying subject matter To VtrOKlfLov to which one addresses oneself and 
which one discusses Ansprechen

proportion The etymological 
also be noted

to three senses of the Latin ratio by which iloyos was traditionally 

to only one of these Notice that Beziehung 
relation can also  be used in some contexts where Ansprechen 

oneself would be equally appropriate 
p which is ordinarily 

und Besprechen as such it lies at the bottom  zurn 

  and in this way iiOyos as ilyOjov 

between Vernehmen and Vernunft should 

Notice further that Verhaltnis 

a synonym for Beziehung

comes  to stand for just such a

Now what must be taken into account if the formal conception

from the ordinary

explicitly Mani
and for the most part does not show

SOJllething

how is this latter 
is it that

Being of entities 

only in disguise is not just 
observa

and gets covered 
up again or which 
this entity or that but rather the

that it 
becomes forgotten

Thus that which demands that it become a phenomenon  and 
demands this in a distinctive 
a thing is what phenomenology 
as  its object

sense and in terms of its ownmost content

 Reading innanwohnen As Heidegger points out in his footnote 

this puzzling 

a strong  verb 

passage has its source in Grimms Kleinere Schri
two short articles the first entitled 
article begins by comparing a number of archaic German words meaning domus 
having a form similar to our English inn which  Grimm  mentions 
innan which  must have meant either habitar
postulate 
or recipere 
with a surviving strong preterite 
to argue that the preposition in is derived from the verb rather than the verb 
preposition 

jten Vol VII pp  ff where we find 
IN and the second IN UND BEl The first 
all 
He goes on to 
e domi esse 
is actually found 

form innian 
written either as an or as ann 

in domum  though only  a weak derivative 

      an bedeutet ich bin gewohnt vertraut mit ich pflege etwas     
In Grimms second article 

he adds there was also an anomalous ann with the plural 
unnum which expressed amo diligo faveo and to which our gonnen 
Gunst are immediately 
bin eingewohnt 
minimal complication 

and 
as has long been recognized Ann really means ich 
may be shown with 
as well as diligo 

pflege zu bauen this conceptual 

which stands for habito 

Grimm goes on 
from the 

transition 

related 

It is not entirely 

an  which corresponds

The reader should note that while the verb wohnen normally means to reside or to 
ich bin gewohnt means I am accustomed to and ich bin einge

ich pfege etwas may mean either I am  accustomed to do something 

dwell the expression 
wohnt means I have become accustomed to the place where I resideto my surround
ings  Similarly 
or I take care of something 
sumably means I am accustomed to putting my trust in something 
The Latin colo

leading the sense here is closer to that of at in such expressions 
fathers 
Grimm who proceeds loc 

does not have quite the semantical 
with which we shall translate 
in the phrase Being alongside 

The 
range of any English pre

meanings of I take care of something 

or that of the French cher

       in dem   Sinne des Aufgehens in der Welt     Aufgehen 

o 

it 

up or to rise in the sense that the sun rises 
the preposition 
it takes on other meanings 

in 

with bauen build and bin 
means literally 
to go 
But when followed by

Thus  geht auf into go in the sense that 

is an existentiale 
founded 

a primordial

one which cannot be

We shall again choose the 

method of 

of Being  which  is  essentially 

different 

in accordance  with 

whose phe

 

for still

This discussion 

of the word world and our frequent use of it have made 
it apparent that it is used in several ways By unravelling these 
we can get 
an indication 
of the way in 

of the different kinds of phenomena that are signified  and 
which they are interconnected 

   World is used as an ontical concept and signifies the totality of 

those entities 

which can be presentathand 

 World functions as  an ontological 

just mentioned  And  indeed 

within the world 
term and signifies the Being 
world  can 
of entities 

a multiplicity 

which encompasses 

which  we have 

of those entities 
become a term for any realm 
for instance 
signifies 

the realm of possible 

when one talks of the world of a mathematician 

objects of mathematics 

world  

 World can be understood in 

another ontical sensenot however 

which Dasein essentially 

as those entities 
countered withinthewo
as such can be said to live World has here 
signification 
for the  public 

different possibilities 
weworld or ones own closest domestic 

Here again there are 

rld but  rather 

as that wherein 

 world rna y stand 
environment 

is  not and which can be en

a factical Dasein 

a preontological 

existentiell 

 Finally world designates 

the ontologicoexistential 

concept of 

Worldhood itself may have as its modes whatever structural 

worldhood 
wholes any special worlds 
the a priori 
expression  world 
sometimes use it in the first  of  these 
single quotation marks 

may have at the time but it embraces in 
character of worldhood in general We shall reserve the 

itself 

as a term for our third signification 

If  we should 

senses we shall mark this with 

The derivative 

form worldly 

will then apply terminologically 

presentathand 

kind of Being which belongs to 
entities

Dasein never to a

A glance at previous ontology shows  that 

if one fails to see Beingin

theworld as a state of Dasein the phenomenon of worldhood likewise 
gets passed over One tries instead to Interpret 
Being of those entities 
which are by no means proximally discoverednamely

this problem at all On the other hand if we are to Interpret

equivalent While it may mean any 
as  a collective 
noun

which is analogous to  our relatively 
specific gear as in gear for fishing or the more 
elaborate paraphernalia or the still more general equipment which we shall employ 
throughout this translation In  this collective 
which is comparable to the use of stuff in such sentences as there is plenty of stuff lying 
around See H  In general however this pejorative connotation 
most part Heidegger uses the term as a collective 
such thing as an equipment but  he still uses it occasionally  with 
item or bit of equipment

it away as when one refers 

erence commitment assignment relegation 

equipment to a purpose for which it is to be used Verweisung 

or commits or relegates 
a symbol to what it symbolizes 

English equivalent 
for the word Verweisung which occurs many times in this chapter 
The basic metaphor seems to be that of turning something away towards something else 
or pointing 
to something else whether one  refers 
to a welfare agency commits a person for trial relegates 
or even assigns 
some of the work  of ref
but it does not do all the work of any of 
these expressions For a businessman to refer to 
a letter for a symbol to refer to what it symbolizes 
for  a man to commit larceny or 
murder or merely to commit himself to certain partisan views for a teacher to give a 
pupil a long assignment or even for a journalist 
we would have to find some other verb than verweisen We shall however use the 
verbs assign  and 
employing whichever seems the more appropriate in the context and occasionally

earlier editions

Umsicht may accordingly 
be thought of as meaning looking around or looking around

usage Umsicht seems to have much the same connotation

  Reference and Signs 
In our provisional 

Interpretation 

of that structure 

of Being  which 

the readytohand 

became visible but we merely gave an indication  of 

to equipment the phenomenon of refer

to its ontological 
and referential 

belongs to 
ence or assignment 
it  and in so sketchy a form that we at once stressed the necessity 
origin  It  became plain 
uncovering it  with  regard 
moreover that  assignments 
could in some sense 
become constitutive 
for worldhood itself Hitherto we have seen the world 
lit  up only in and for certain definite ways in which we concern ourselves 
environmentally 
only with the readinesstohand 
in understanding 
firmer  becomes 
may be  laid bare 

the broader and  
the phenomenal basis on which the worldphenomenon 

and indeed it  has been lit  up 
of that concern So the further we proceed 

with the readytohand 

withintheworld 

the Being of entities

We shall  again 

take as our point of departure the Being of the ready

reference or assignment itself more precisely 
attempt an 
ontological

in signs The word sign designates 
many kinds of things not only may it 
stand for different kinds of signs but Beingasignfor can itself be

by  the emphasis which 
Heidegger gives to the prepositions

leave 
these prepositions untranslated 
and simply write Any such entity is involved in doing

substantiality

no further than that of the ancients in inquiring

no headway is made with  a question

If we subject Descartes Interpretation 

to a  critical 

resistance 
what shows itself in sensation

analysis 

Hardness gets taken  as  resist

of the experience of hardness and 
it will be plain how unable he  is to let

Cf Section    
ance But neither hardness nor resistance 

in itself 

with a velocity 

be determined in such an experience For Descartes 

encountered 

is obliterated

in such perception 

So  if a Thing resists 

this way the kind  of Being which belongs 

amounts to  no more than not yielding placethat  is 

  and so is any possibility 

or that it is changing its own location 

in  a phenomenal sense as something experienced 

not 
this means that 
to some other Thing  which is 

is understood 
whose nature  can 
resistance 
undergoing any change of location 
it stays in  a definite location relatively 
changing its location 
which permits the other Thing to catch up with it But when the exper
ience of hardness is Interpreted 
to sensory perception 
entities 
should be grasped in their Being 
Descartes takes the kind of  Being which belongs to the perception 
something 
and translates 
of something  becomes 
side of two res extensae 
movements are related is itself a mode of that extensio

course no behaviour in which one feels ones way

Things Hardness and resistance

this does not mean that

of possible

however that even if in point offact both the problem

Descartes has narrowed down the question of the world  to  that 

of 

as those entities 

Things of Nature Naturdinglichkeit 
which are proximally  accessible 
He has confirmed the opinion that to 
know an entity in what is supposedly 
the most rigorous ontical Inanner is 
our only possible access to the primary Being of the entity which such 
knowledge reveals But at the same time we must have the insight to 
see that in principle the roundingsout 
of the Thingontology 
also 
operate on the same dogmatic basis as that which Descartes 

withintheworld 

We have already intinated in  Section 

has adopted 
 that passing over  the world 
encounter is not accidental 
not 

to correct but that it is grounded 

which we proximally 

which it would be simple 

belongs essentially  to 

and those entities 
an oversight 
in a kind of Being  which 
analytic of Dasein has given some 
of Dasein which are of the most importance in the framework of this 
problematic

Being in general the horizon within which its intelligibility 
becomes 
possible

   Why was the phenomenon of the world passed 

over at the beginning 

of the ontological tradition 
in the case of Parmenides and  why has this passingover 
kept 
constantly recurring

which has been decisive 

for us explicitly 

 

 Why is it that instead of the phenomenon thus passed over 

entities 

withintheworld 

have intervened 

as an ontological 

theme  

 Why are these entities 
 Why has recourse been  taken  to  the 

found in the first instance in  Nature  

phenomenon of value when it 

has seemed necessary 

to round out such an ontology of the world

a deseverance

Dasein addresses  itself in

But this is not  the

What we have hitherto

and taking a look at  it 
aim is one Of fundamental 
as our theme 
of this phenomenon 
inappropriate 
analysis 
the fact that something 
possibility 
stitutive 
equiprimordial
 The phenomenon  of 
items has often been disregarded in 
ally unrestrained 
simple primal 

that a multiplicity 

by deriving 

tendency 

ground 

for it If these show themselves 

of characteristics 

of Being may  be con
they are 

then existentially 

the equiprimordiality 

of constitutive 

ontology 

because 

of a methodologic

to derive everything 

and anything 

from some 

subject by the worlds Beingpresent

from this between would still be 

in view when we 
phenomenologically 
to this phenomenon
 Beingin 
from the present  

keeping 

a subject presentathand

by recalling 

itself 

in something 
that is effected

is not a characteristic 

which is presentathand 
between 

is distinct 
presentathand 

kind of Being of this entity 
with this phenomenon 

must we look if we are to 
 We get the answer to this question 

in a presentathand 
is rather an essential 
case what else is presented 

I   In which direction 
as such phenomenally
what we were charged with 
called 
athand 
is presentatha

But in  that 
commercium

is to prevent 
phenomenal 
positive 
reaching 
and detailed 
which was ontically 

the splitting 
content 
study is simply to express 
selfevident 

 Such an interpretation 
if we were to say that Dasein is the Being of this 

is ontologically 
of the convenientia 

vague The between 
of two  things 
that are 
always splits the phenom

with which this joiningtogether

way  of treating 

For with such an orientation 

Yet  to take our orientation 

But to assume these beforehand 

To say that for this we need far

and there is no prospect 

in other words to hold its

and 

so in a way which 

is to be accomplis

of the phenomenon

of putting 

it together 

as the result 

would come closer

 What is decisive 

for ontology 

we would also be covertly 

the fact that something

problem of knowledge has often been ontologically 
where it has been lost sight of altogether

The entity which is essentially

is

of the 
word the there points to a here and a yonder There here of an 
here is always understood in relation to a yonder readytohand in 
the sense of a Being towards this yondera Being which is deseverant 
directional 
determines its location
yonder belongs definitely to something encountered 
Here and yonder are possible 
there is an entity which has made a disclosure

When we talk in  an ontically 

it is in such a way as to  be its there To say 
erleuchtet means that as Beingintheworld

figurative way of the lumen  naturale

structure 
that it is illuminated 
it is cleared  gelich

cleared in this way does that 
the light or hidden in the dark Byitsverynature Dasein brings its there 
along with it If it lacks its there 
essentially 

Dasein indeed it is not this entity at all Dasein is its disclosedness 

 Only for an entity which is existentially 

which is presentathand 

itself not  through 

it is not factically 

the entity which is

what they do is to assail Dasein in its unreflecting

 In this paragraph Heidegger introduces 

wird 
the important words Vorhabe 

Vorsicht 

and we shall handle the other terms in the same manner Vorsicht 

by some such expression as what we 

perhaps best translated 

and Vorgriff Vorhabe is 
have in advance or what we have before us but we shall usually find it more convenient 
to adopt the shorter term forehaving 
present sentence 
what we see in advance or foresight is the only one of these expressions 
in ordinary  German  usage 
Heidegger however uses it in a more general sense somewhat more akin to the English 
foresight 
Vorgriff what 
of a shrewd and accurate prediction 
without the connotation 
we grasp in advance or foreconception is related to the verb vorgreif
en to antici
pate as well as to the noun Begriff  

and often has  the connotation 

occasionally 

to hendiadys 

which occurs 

of caution 

or prudence 

resorting 

as in the

And if we are inquiring about 

the meaning of Being our investigation 

does not then become a deep one tiefsinnig nor does it puzzle out

For one thing it can be demonstrated by considering  assertion 

in 

in the decisive period 

and interpretation

of fundamental ontqlogy  because

For another thing the analysis of assertion 
problematic 
when ancient ontology was 
clue for obtaining access to that which authentically 
i s   
Seienden and for defining the  Being 
of such entities 
has been accepted from ancient times 
of truth The phenomenon of truth is  so thoroughly coupled with the 
problem of Being  that  our 
as it proceeds further will 
come up against the problem of truth and it already lies 
necessarily 
within the dimensions of that problem  though 
not explicitly 
analysis of assertion 
will at the same time prepare 
problematic

as the primary and authentic 

investigation 

The 

the way for this latter 

In what follows we give three significations 

to the term assert

These are drawn from the phenomenon which is thus designated

are connected among themselves

and in their unity they encompass  the

 The primary signification 
In this we adhere to the primordial 
meaning

what is discovered for sight is not a meaning  but  an entity in the way

what are the existential 
world so far as the  latter 
itself in the kind of Being of the they Does the they have a state
ofmind which is specific to it a special way of understanding 
and interpreting
 It becomes all the more urgent to answer these ques
tions when we remember that proximally 
and for  the most part Dasein 
is absorbed in the they and is mastered by it Is not Dasein as thrown 
Beingintheworld 
of the 
they And what does  this 
disclosedness 

right into the publicness 

thrown proximally 

mean other than the specific

of the they 
If understanding 

as Daseins potentiality

primarily 
of the way of understanding 

which belongs to the they that we must gather  which 
of its Being have been disclosed 

must be conceived 
forBeing then it is from an analysis

possibilities 
as  they In that case however these possibilities 
manifest an essential 
ness And finally when this tendency has been  explicated

kind ofBeing ofDasein 
in such a way indeed that from this kind of Beingl the phenomenon of

in that case understanding

In the end idle talk is even indignant

so long as

when one is on  the

when what

But when Dasein goes 

in for something in the reticence 

of carrying  it 

time is a different 

even of genuinely breaking down on it  its 

through  or 
time and as seen  by the public an essentially 
slower time than that of 
idle talk which lives at a faster rate Idle talk will thus long since have 
the very newest thing That 
gone on to something else which is currently 
has come too 
which was earlier 
has now been carried through 
late if one looks at that which is newest Idle talk and curiosity 
take care 
in their ambiguity to ensure that 
out of date as soon as it emerges before the public Such a new creation 
can become free in its positive 
it up has become ineffective and if the common interest 

what is genuinely and newly created is 

only if the idle talk which covers 

possibilities 

surmise and 

has died away 

gets passed off as what is really happening 

In the ambiguity of the way things have been  publicly 

talking about things ahead of the game  and making surmises 
curiously 
and carrying something through get stamped as  something  merely 
sequent  and 
constantly going wrong versieht

Thus Daseins understanding 

of Beingwithoneanother

idle talk and  the most ingenious 
an everyday manner everything 

curiosity 

and at bottom nothing is happening 

Being and Time 

  
keep things moving where in 

This ambiguity is always tossing to curiosity 

that which it seeks  and 

it gives idle talk the semblance of having everything 
of Being of the disclosedness 

But this  kind 

decided in it 

of Beingintheworld 

ther as such The Other is proximally 

and what they know about him  Into 

him what they say

Everyone keeps his eye on the Other first and next watching 
comport himself and what he will say in reply Beingwithoneanother

In this connection 

we  must notice that ambiguity does not first arise 
at disguise or distortion 

Dasein first conjures up It is already implied 

from aiming explicitly 
thing which the individual 
in Being with one another as thrown 
Publicly 
selves against this Interpretation 
way things have been interpreted 
correct It would be  a misunderstanding

agreement 

in  a world 
however it is quite hidden and thfy will always defend them
of the kind ofBeing which belongs to the 
lest it should prove 
if we were to seek to  have the 
of these phenomena confirmed by looking to the they for 

Beingwithoneanother 

by the  they 

The phenomena of idle talk curiosity 

and ambiguity have been set 

forth in such a manner as to indicate that they are already interconnected 
in  their 
Being We must now grasp in an existentialontological 
the kind of Being which belongs to this  interconne
of Being which belongs to everydayness 
horizon of those structures 
obtained 

of Daseins Being which have been hitherto 

ction The basic  kind 

is to be understood

  Falling 

and Thrownness 

Idle talk curiosity 

and ambiguity characterize 

the way in which in 

an everyday manner Dasein is its therethe 
theworld As definite existential 
hand in Dasein  but 
they are interconnected 
there is revealed a basic kind  of 
Being which belongs to everydayness we call this the falling ofDasein

In these and in the way

Being and Time 

Self and  has fallen into the world Fallenness 

in      Aufgehen bei      has mostly  the 

for Being  its 

of Beinglost 

in the publicness 

This term does 

in Beingwithoneanother 

fallen away abgefallen 

not express any negative evaluation 

but is used to signify 
and for the most part alongside the world of its 

of the they Dasein has in the 
from itself as an authentic 
pot

that Dasein is proximally 
concern This absorption 
character 
first instance 
entiality 
into the world means an absorption 
as the latter is guided by idle talk curiosity 
Interpretation 
of falling what we have  called 
Daseinx may now be defined more precisely 
do the  terms 
and nonauthentic 
if in this mode of Being Dasein were  altogether 
authenticity 
but amounts rather to a quite distinctive 
kind which is completely 
with of Others in the they NotBeingitsself Das 
of that entity which in its essential 
con
functions as a positive 
cern is absorbed in a world This kind of notBeing 
as 
has to be conceived 
that kind of Being which is closest to Dasein and in which Dasein main
tains itself for the most part 

not  as 
signify really 
to lose its Being In

in so far 
Through the 
 of 

fascinated by the world and by the Dasein

the inauthenticity
On no account however 

inauthentic 

and ambiguity 

possibility 

does not mean anything like Beingnolongerinthewo

rld 

kind of Beingintheworldthe 

Nichtesselbstsein 

So neither must we take the fallenness 

of Dasein 

from a purer 
Not only do we lack any experience of this 
we lack any possibilities 
or clues for Inter

as a fall 

and higher primal status 
ontically 
preting it 

but ontologically 

In falling Dasein itself as factical Beingintheworld 

is something from 

fallen into some 

which it has already fallen away And it  has not 
which it comes upon for the first time in  the course of its Being or even 
one which it has not come upon at all it has fallen into the world 
which 
itself 
belongs to its Being Falling is a definite  existential 
ofDasein itsel
f It makes no assertion 
athand or about presentathand 
is descended 
or with which  Dasein 
sort of commerci
um 

about Dasein as something present
from which Dasein 

has subsequently wound 

to entities 

relations 

up in some 

entity 

characteristic 

We would also misunderstand 

the ontologicoexistential 
structure 

of 

falling if we were to ascribe to it the sense of a bad  and deplorable 
ontical property of which perhaps more advanced stages of human 
culture might be able to rid themselves

translating

hardly the correct

rather that of 

such as this the preposition  into 

is 
against 
falling at the world or collapsing

we have 

whether man is drunk with sin and in the status corruptionis

Dasein turns away from itself That in the face of which it

this entity

that Beingintheworld

to Daseins Being as

itself is that in the face of which anxiery is anxious 

somethingin 

essentially 

the world 

Beinganxious 

discloses primordially 

and directly 

the world as world 

that the world first gets thought of by deliberating 
 without regard for  the entities 

It is not the case say 
about it just by  itself
and that in the face of this world anxiety then arises what is rather the 
first and foremost by anxiety as 
case is that the world as world is disclosed 
a mode of stateofmind This does not 
signify however that in anxiety 
the worldhood of the world gets 

conceptualized 

withintheworld 

to this or that factically  concrete 

Anxiety is not only anxiety in the face of something 

but as a stateof

and there

about is 

That which anxiety is profoundly 

not a definite kind of Being for Dasein or 

for it Indeed the threat itself is indefinite

finally we must make  sure

Kants Refutation of Idealismix

shows how intricate  these 
are and  how what one wants to prove gets muddled with what one does 
prove and with  the

away with any scepticism

which however is empirical 
objects in the space outside of mexJ 
that Kant uses  the 
term 
note explicitly 

He proposes such a proof himself and indeed 

and of human reason in generalx 

We must in the first instance 

that The mere conscious

r his theorem

that there is 

in 

that kind of Being which in the present investigation 

oriented with regard to entities  withintheworld 

to designate 

Dasein 
we have called presenceathan
for Kant a consciousness 
Descartes 
presentathand 
hand of Things 

When Kant uses  the 

of consciousness 

d Consciousness 

of my Dasein means 
in the sense of 
of my Beingpresentathand 
has in mind the Being

term Dasein  he 

just  as much as the Beingpresentat

The proof 

for the Dasein of Things outside of me is supported 

by the 

fact that both change and performance 
belong with equal primordia ity 
to the essence of time My own Beingpresentathandthat 
Beingpresentathand 
ns which has been 
given in the inner senseis a process of change which is presentathand 
To have a determinate temporal character 
presupposes  something 
presentathand 
cannot be in us for only through  what 

which is permanent But this 

Zeitbestimmtheit

is thus permanent can my

Dasein in time be determined

are presentat
that along with 

 hand have been posited empirically 

outside 

in me it is necessary 
these something permanent which is presentathand 
of me What is thus permanent is the condition 
empirically 
which 
makes it possible for the changes in  me to be presentathand
 The 
experience of the Beingintime 
changing in me and something  permanent 
both with equal primordiality 

posits something 
of me  and it posits 

of representations 

should be posited 

outside 

Of course this proof is not a causal inference and is therefore not 

up the Cartesian 

he takes the subjectthe in  meas 

which that would imply Kant gives 
proof  in terms of the idea of a temporal entity 
approach of positing 

encumbered with the disadvantages 
as it were an ontological 
It seems at first as if Kant has given 
a subject one can come across in isolation 
But only in semblance 
That 
Kant demands any proof at all for the Dasein of Things outside of me 
the starting
shows already  that 
his proof itself is then carried 
point for this problematic  Moreover 
given changes in me  For only 
through by starting 
in me is time experienced and time carries the burden of the proof 
Time provides the basis for leaping off into what 
of me in the 
course of the proof Furthermore

There are three theses which characterize

been first defined  that the locus

of truth lies in the agreement

locus but has set going the defini

To say that before Newton his laws were neither true nor false cannot

remains a fanciful contention

As long as such a proof is still outstanding 

this principle 

which does not gain  in legitimacy

Because

that all truth

stood is it in the least impaired by the fact that it is ontically 
possible 
only in the subject and that it stands and falls with the Being of that

as uncovering 
can it be taken out of the province 

and free them Only so can these entities

Dasein must be The usual refutation of that  scepticism 
either the Being  of truth or its cognizability 
shows as a formal argument is simply that if anything gets judged  truth 
has been presupposed This suggests  that 
that pointing something out is by its very meaning an uncovering 
when one says this one has to clarify why that in which  there 
logical ground for this necessary 
as regards  their

presupposing 
Moreover one here fails to recognize that even when nobody judges  
truth already gets presupposed 

and truth 
Being must be as it is The kind of Being which belongs

A sceptic can no more be refuted than the Being of truth can  be 
of the kind who denies the truth factically is 

proved And if any sceptic 
he does not even need to be refuted In so far as he is and  has understood 
himself in this Being he has obliterated 
suicide and in doing so he has also obliterated 
for its own part cannot first be subjected to proof the  necessity  of truth 
cannot be proved either It has no more been demonstrated

The verb vertreten

No one can take the  ther s dying away from him Of course someone can go to

These are the facts of the case exist

In the first instance 

ending signifies stopping and it signifies this

But ending as getting 

finished does not include fulfilling 

On the 
other hand whatever has got to be fulfilled must indeed reach the finished

ness that is possible 
for it Fulfilling

founded upon  it

II I 
analysis of Beingcertain 
will in the end 

Being and Time 

present us with a distinctive 

certain 

of Dasein 

with regard to death and this  Beingcertain 

For the most part 

everyday Dasein covers up  the ownmost possibility 

 

which is nonrelational

death as an event which  one

They say  It 

is certain that Death is comingl They say it and the 
the fact that in order to be able to be certain of 

they overlooks 
death Dasein itself must in every case be certain of its ownmost  non

of its death And what is the ground of everyday Beingcertain
Manifestly it is not  just  mutual

Taken strictly

of the certainty

failure to recognize Daseins kind 
which belongs to Daseina failure that 
The fact that demise as an event which occurs

Dasein does not exclusively 

for the most part veils from itself

cases of 
In evading its death even everyday Being
is indeed certain of its death in another way than it 
This 
Every
in such a manner 

towardstheend 
might itself like to have true on purely theoretical 
other way is what everydayness 
dayness  does 
We have already characterized 
in an air of superiority 
iority which is anxiously  concerned 
In this stateofmind everydayness acknowledges 
one which is only empirical One knows about the certainty of 
yet is not authentically 
Dasein is acquainted 
But in the light of what it evades this very evasion attests 
that death must be conceived as ones ownmost possibility 
not to be outstripped 

certain of ones own The falling everydayness 
and yet evades Beingcertain 
phenomenally 
nonrelational 

with regard to the certain fact of deatha super

the everyday stateofmind which consists 

than 
death and 
of 

while seemingly free from  anxiety 

with deaths certainty 

andabove allcertain 
One says Death  certainly  comes 

a higher  certainty 

but not right away With this 
is certain  Not 

accessible 

but a way in which the they interprets 

right away is  not 

and this is done by invoking the socalled 

the they refers itself to that which is 
to Dasein and amenable to its concern Everyday

but      the they denies  that  death 
a purely negative assertion 
itself With this interpretation 
proximally 
ness forces its way into the urgency of concern and divests itself of the 
fetters of a weary inactive 
thinking about death Death  is deferred to 
sometime later 
opinion  allgemeine 
peculiar in deaths certaintythat 
the certainty 
towardsdeath 
But such a procedure cannot signify calculating 
to arrive In  the face of definiteness 
such as this Dasein would sooner 
flee Everyday concern makes definite for itself the indefiniteness 
of certain 
death by interposing  bef
which can 
be taken in at a glance and which belong to the everyday matters that 
are closest to us 

general 
Ermessen  Thus the they covers up what  is 
Along with 

of its when Everyday Being

evades this indefiniteness 

of death goes the 

when  the demise is due

But when this indefiniteness has 

covered up too  Thus deaths ownm
veileda possibility 
that is to say possible 

which is certain  and 
at any moment 

has been 
been covered up the certainty 
ost character as a possibility 
gets 
at the same time indefinite

Now that we have completed our Interpretation 

of the everyday 

manner in which the they talks  about 

death and the way death  enters 

Being and Time 
to the characters 

II I 
into Dasein we have  been  led 
and indefinite

defined as follows death as the 
nonrelatio

end of Dasein is Dasein s ownmost 

of death may now bt 

nal certain 

of certainty

Defining the existential 

structure 
helps us to 
of Dasein in which Dasein 
as Dasein can be  a 

of Beingtowardstheend 

Dasein already is towards 

its endthat 
coming to grips with its death though in a fugitive 
determina

to which Dasein ultimately 
comes

The fact that even everyday

only in its demise In Dasein as  being

Interpretation

The phenomenon

problem of the possible

as a kind of discoursein 
for Dasein In considering

that  of  tracing

When one

  The Character of Conscience  as 

a Call 

To any discourse 

there belongs  that 
about something 

which is talked about in it Dis
so in some definite 
it is saying 

and  does 

From what is thus talked about it draws whatever 

course gives information

this particular 
communication 
this  becomes 
for the most part by way of uttering

accessible 

in the talk as such In discourse 
of Others

it in language 

as 
as 

In the call of 

conscience 

what is it that is talked aboutin 

other words 

Dasein itself This answer is as 

as it is indefinite If the call has 

to what is the appeal made Manifestly 
incontestable 
might at most remain an occasion 
But it is essential 
to Dasein  that 
it has 
reaches 
which is concernful in  an everyday 
the theyself 

Dasein in this understanding 

of concernful Being with Others 

then it

to itself 
along with the disclosedness 
of its world 
to itself so that it always understands itself The call 

of itself

which it always has and 

been disclosed 

so vague a target 

And to what is one called when one is thus  appealed 

to To ones  

of  set 

manner  of 

be carried along 

let itself 
after  the 

nor to what it has  taken hold 

with The sort of Dasein which is 
the world both for Others  and 

own Self Not to what Dasein countsf
being with one another 
publicly 
about  or 
understood 
gets passed over in this appeal  this 
Self takes not the slightest cognizance 
theyself 
the fact that the call passes over both the they and the manner in which 
Dasein has been publicly 
does not by any means signify that 
the they is not reached 
in passing 
is for public  repute 
losigkeit
and hidingplace 

of which the call to the 
only the Self of the 
But 

interpreted 
too Precisely 

the call pushes it into insignificance 

And because 
to hear the they collapses 

 But the Self which the appeal has robbed of this lodgement

Dasein We have not fully determined 

by it we must first ask what it gives us to understand 

it as one  which calls  us 

we understand 

But is not  the question of what the call says answered more easily and 

surely if we simply 

allude  to 

what we generally 

hear or fail to hear in 

 any experience 

of conscience  namely that the call either addresses 

Dasein 
gives warning refers 

that one is 

anew who says how we are guilty and what guilt 

tial conception of this Beingguilty 

would still remain 

of no guilt Whatever the ways in which conscience 

itself as Guilty whence could it draw 
of its own Being All the 

and forced upon Dasein If any understanding 
possible 

as Guilty or as in the case when the conscience 
to a possible Guilty  or affirms as a good conscience 
is experi

enced or interpreted all our experiences 
agree on this Guilty If only 
it were not defined in such wholly different ways And even if the meaning 
of this Guilty should let itself be taken in a way upon which everyone 
is agreed the existen
obscure Yet if Dasein addresses 
its idea of guilt except from the Interpretation 
same the question arises 
could be 
of guilt is not  one  which 
signifies On the other hand  the  idea 
of 
thought up arbitrarily 
the essence of guilt  is 
must have been 
sketched out in Dasein beforehand How are we to find the trail which 
can lead  to revealing 
such phenomena as 
everyday interpretation 
falling as its  kind 
part inauthentic 
Dasein the primordially 
questions 
injunction as to the primordial 
along with it Where however shall we get our criterion 
existential 
turns up as a predicate 
stood as guilt 
such and  that it does so in  such a way that so far as any Dasein factically 
exists 

of 
guilt conscience and death must start with what 
the 
of Dasein says about them Because Dasein has 
is for the most 
essence for to 

meaning of the Guilty  From the fact that this Guilty 
that what is under
in Daseins Being as 

idea of the phenomenon is revealed 
for the primordial 

remains alien But whenever we see something wrongly some 

of Being the way Dasein gets interpreted 

at all then this possibility 

in our inauthentic 

interpretation  lies 

ontological 

way of formulating 

for the I am Is 

ally oriented 

and does not reach  the 

appropriate 

it possible 

this phenomenon  All ontological 

investigations 

it is also guilty 

Thus by invoking the Guilty which everyone agrees that he  hears 

one has not yet answered the question of the existential 

meaning of what 

II  
has been called in the  call 
tualized

with Others 
arise and in what way 

We need not consider how 

such requirements 

as requirements 

and laws must be conceived 

punishable and as having debts 

the breach of a moral requirement 

by reason of 
In any case Beingguilty in the sense last 
is a kind of Being which 

their character 
their having such a source 
mentioned 
belongs to Dasein Of course this holds good also for Beingguilty 
making oneself

one takes  laden with moral guilt 
very little

kind of attribute

for      These too are ways in which Dasein behaves If 

does not suffice for distinguishing 

that when the idea of deserving 

Mter all the concept 

other ways of behaving 

and for any having 

of moral guilt has been so 

On the contrary 

as a quality 

punishment 

of Dasein 

one has said 

as 

 little 

to someone 

or even of having debts 
or when these ideas 
interpretations 
remained 
of concern in the sense of reckoning 

of this phenomenon 

so But therewith 

have been employed 

has also been included 
in the very defining 

in this concept 

could become prevalent  and 

of it such

the Guilty gets thrust 

aside into the domain 

The phenomenon 

of guilt which is not necessarily 

up claims and balancing 
them off 
related 

to having 

debts and lawbreaking 
ciple into Daseins 
ofGuilty in terms ofDaseins 

only if we first inquire 
 in other words if we conceive 
kind of Being 

can be clarified 

Beingguilty

in prin

If this is our goal the idea of Guilty must be sufficiently 

which are related 

will drop out The idea of guilt must not 

that those ordinary phenomena 
of guilt 
cemful Being with Others 
only be raised above the domain of that concern in which we reckon 
things up but 
ought such  that 
guilt 
something which ought to be and which can be is missing 

from relationship 
to any law or 
with it one loads himself 
with 
defined as a lackwhen 

it must also be detached 
by failing to comply 

is still necessarily

Being and Time 

for an entity whose Being

Dasein is  its 

basis existentlythat 

is in such  a  manner 
and as so understanding 

in one possibility 
or another  it 
yforBeing it always  stands 
is not other possibilities
has waived these in its existentiell 
 and it 
Not only  is the  projection as one that has been thrown 
by the nullity of Beingabasis

that it under
stands itself in terms of possibilities 
itself is 
that entity which has been thrown But this implies that in having a 
potentialit
constantly 
projection 
determined 
null This does not mean that it has the ontical property ofinconsequent
iality 
ially constitutive 
we have in mind belongs to Daseins Beingfree for its existenti

The nullity 

of the Being of projection 

or worthlessness

for the structure 

 as projection 

it is itself essentially 

In the structure 

of thrownness 

as in that of projection  there 

lies 

a nullity  This  nullity 

of inau
essentially 
is the basis for the possibility 
thentic Dasein in its falling and as falling every inauthentic 
Dasein 
with nullity 
and 
factically 
through 
Beingthebasis 
means that Dasein as such is guilty 
guilt as Beingthebasis 

is Care itself in its very essence 
through 
Thus care D aseins Beingmeans as thrown projection 

is itself null This 
definition 
of 

of a nullity and this Beingthebasis 

if our formally existential 

is permeated 

is indeed correct 

of a nullity 

Existential 

nullity has by no means the character 

where 
of a privation 
with an ideal which has been set up but 

something is lacking in comparison 
does not get attained in Dasein rather the Being of this entity is already 
null as projection and it is null in advance 
can project and which it mostly attains This nullity 
not something which emerges in Dasein occasionally 
it as an obscure  quality 
progress 

of  vor any of the things which it 
moreover is thus 
attaching  itself to 

which Dasein might eliminate if it made sufficient 

In spite of this  the 

ontological 

meaning 

of the notness 

nullity is  still 

obscure But this holds  also 

existential 
essence of the not in general Ontology and logic to be sure have exacted 
a great deal from the  not 
and have thus made its possibilities 
visible 
not been unveiled ontologically 
in a piecemeal fashion but  it itself has 
Ontology came across the not and made use of it But is it so obvious  

Nichtheit 
of this 
for the ontological 

 The negative character to which Heidegger here calls attention 

etymologically 

is not brought out 
throwing forward as it is by the 

off or throwing away where the prefix ent indicates 

as clearly by the word projection 
German  entwerfen throwing 
separation 

Being and Time 

exhausted by the fact that it constitutes 

 
II  
that every not signifies something negative in the sense of a lack Is its 
positivity 
something 
Why does all dialectic 
it as a 
grounds for this sort of thing itself or even just establish 
dialectical 
problem Has anyone ever made a  problem of the ontologica
of 
notness or prior to that 
which the problem of the  not 
notness  can 
except by taking 

and its notness and the possibility 
to be found 

be raised And how else are these conditions 

even sought the mere conditions 

passing  over 
though it cannot provide 

as a theme and clarifying it 

of Being in general 

take refuge in negation 

l source 
on the basis  of 

the meaning 

of that 

The concepts of privation and lackw hich moreover are not very 

Interpretation

of the phenomenon of guilt  though 
can put them to  considerable 
the existential 
idea of evil the malum as privatio

have the same ontological 
this ontology also applies to the idea ofvalue which has been abstracted 
from these 

if we take them formally enough we 
all can we  come any closer to 
from the 

phenomenon of guilt by taking  our 

origin in the ontology  of 

Just as the bonum and its privatio 

orientation

the presentathand 

Not only can entities 

whose Being is care load themselves

the very basis of their Being and this Being

what provides above all the ontological 

guilt but they are guilty  in 
guilty  is

guilty is equiprimordially

The

speaks for this primordial Beingguilty

make itself known rather in the very fact that

 is 
guilt there only if a consciousness 
primordial 
Beingguilty 
guilt is asleep That  this 
and for the most part undisclosed 
falling Being reveals 
only the aforesaid nullity Beingguilty is more 
primordial than  any knowledge about it And only because Dasein is 
guilty in the basis of its Being and closes itself off from itself as something 
possible if indeed the call gives us this 
thrown and falling is conscience 
Beingguilty 

remains proximally 
that it is kept closed off by Daseins 

as something which at bottom we are to understand 

primordial Beingguilty 

The call is the call of care Beingguilty 

constitutes 

the Being to which

In this ordinary interpretation

always speaks in a way that is relative 

it is never so radically

Let us begin our discussion 

with the last of these considerati

of conscience the evil  or 
is primarily 

evil such a conscience 

bad conscience 

makes known to 

experience 

all interpretations 
priority conscience 
us that in every 
experienced 
known of Beingevil 
tifter  the deed has been done 
gression 

something like a Guilty gets 
first But in the idea of bad conscience how is this making

of conscience 

understood The Experience 

of conscience 
turns up 

and points back  to that event which has befallen  and 

or left undone The voice follows the trans
by which 

ons In 
gets  the 

forehaving 

within  whose  scope  the  phenomenon  has 

Being and Time 

with guilt 

If conscience 

 

II  
Dasein has loaded itself 
guilty 
so by remembering 

then it cannot do this by summoning 

the guilt which has 

been incurred 

makes known a Being
us to something 

but it does 
and referring to it 
the call 

prevent 

But does the fact that the voice comes afterwards 

ce 

in the sequence 

which  are 

presentat

The voice is something 

primordially 

What if factical 

with the character of something 

calling 
conscience 

of Experiences 
of the deed 

goes only halfway That such is the case is evident 

the phenomenon 
were only the occasion 

of conscience 
for the factical 

orth That the voice gets taken as  a 
a callingf
which follows after is not enough to prove that we 

of conscien
which we have 
from the 
been 
that turns up 

 T 
call 
But neither the 
nor the guilt with which one is laden 

from being basically 
stirring 
of conscience 
understand 
indebteqness 
What if that  Interpretation 
of the evil 
described 
ontological 
brought by this Interpretation 
it has its position 
hand and it follows after the Experience 
nor the deed which has happened 
is an occurrence 
runs its course The call 
the call Dasein  is 
directs 
back to its 
an interconnected 
the voice as something 
therefore necessarily 
refers back  The 
beyond the deed which has happened 
which one has been thrown 
at the same time this 
to be seized upon in ones own existence  so 
Beingguilty 
basically 
forward as it calls one back into ones thrownness The order of the sequence 
which Experiences 

has the kind of Being which belongs 
to care In 
in such a way that at the same time it 
that Dasein is 
to take 
which 

as something 
existentiell 
only follows after the call not vice versa Bad conscience 

calls forth to Beingguilty 
that authentic 

positing 
Experiences 

which comes afterwards something 

voice does call back  but  it 

in 
structure 

which is earlier 

than any indebtedness 

so far from just reproving 

and pointing 

thrownness Only by first 

calls 
into 
But 

does not give us the phenomenal 

sequence 

of successive 

presentathand 

which 

back that 

it rather 

points 

callingback 

ahead of itself 

is it possible 

run their course 

of existing 

later 

itself 

is 

and back to the  Beingguilty 

If we cannot reach the primordial 

phenomenon 

by a characterization 

still 

of bad conscience

or as one which is essentially

that the conscience 
becomes a slave of Pharisaism 
We have followed English

of good 

a selfsubsis

tent form of conscience 

founded upon bad conscience 
Just as 

would be made known to us in the 
must have 
made known its Beinggo
which used to 

be an effluence

od It is 

easy to see 

Such a conscience 

of the divine power now 
would let a man say of 

idiom in translating 
prefix vor 
is the same 

vorweisen as point 

in both cases and 

forward and vorrufen

as call forth but the 

Being arld Time 

II  
himself I am good  who else can  say this than the  good man himself 
and who would be less willing to affirm it  But if this impossible con
clusion is drawn 
of the good conscience the fact that Being
guilty is what the conscience  calls 

only comes to the fore 

from the idea 

To escape this conclusion 

the good conscience 

has been Interpreted 

of the bad one and defined as an Experienced 

lack ofbad 
as a privation 
consciencevlll This would  make it an experience 
of not having the call

But how is such a lack Experience

that one is emerging from the possibility 
In  the certainty

ownmost and constant Beingguilty

short  it is

is neither a 
form of  conscience nor a founded form of conscience  in 

not a consciencephenomenon 

The good conscience 

at all 

here mentioned lurks the tranquillizing  suppression 

In so far as talk about a good conscience arises from everyday Daseins 
the conscience everyday Dasein merely betrays 

way of experiencing 
thereby that even when it speaks of the  bad  conscience 
to reach  the  phenomenon 
factically 
keeps within the dimension  of 
innocence 
horizon within which the voice of conscience gets Experienced 

For the idea of the  bad  conscience  is 
by that of the good conscience The everyday interpretation 
concernfully reckoning up guilt  and 

and balancing them off This then  is  the 

Unschuld 

it basically 
fails

In characterizing 

what is primordial 

in the ideas of bad  and 

good 

between a conscience 

to the distinction 

conscience we have also decided as 
which points forward and warns and one which points back and reproves 
The idea of the warning conscience 
s ee ms of course to come closest to 
the phenomenon of  the summons It shares with this the character of 
pointing forward But his agreement is just an illusion 
When we exper
ience a warning conscience the voice is regarded in turn as merely oriented 
towards the  deed which has been willed from which it seeks to preserve 
us  But the warning as a check on what we  have willed is possible 
because the warning call is aimed at Daseins potentiali

The third consideration

fact that

Does it follow from this that theories

falling which is an essential kind of Being for Dasein show us rather that 
itself proximally and for the most part 
ontically 
in terms of the horizon  of 
it defines 
Being in the sense of presenceathand
 This however leads to cover
ing up the phenomenon in  two ways what one sees in this theory is  a 
sequence of Experiences 
of Being is for the most part wholly  indefinite  In 
conscience 
Dasein reckons and pleads its cause 

a sequence whose kind

When Kant represented

this the basic guiding idea in his Interpretation of it  he 
did not do so by 
accident this was suggested by the idea of moral lawalthough his 
conception 
and eudae

 Understanding 

What kind of mood corresponds 

to such understanding

the call discloses 

ones own Dasein in the uncanniness 

of its individualiza

  tion The uncanniness which 

is revealed in understanding 

and revealed 
by the stateofmind of anxiety 

along with it becomes genuinely disclosed 
which belongs to that understanding
Dasein 
gives us phenomenal confirmation that in understanding 
is brought face  to face with its own uncanniness Wantingtohavea
conscience 

becomes a readiness 

the  call 

for anxiety 

 The fact  of the anxiery of conscience 

The third essential 

item in disclosedness 

is discourse 

The call itself is a 

kind  of discourse 

any counterdiscourse

for Dasein but there is no corresponding 

In the call ones constant 

in which let us  say one talks about what the con

and pleads ones cause In hearing the call understand

 not because one has been 
ones hearing but 
the content of the call uncon

primordial 
counterdiscourse 
science  has  said 
ingly one denies  oneself 
assailed by some obscure power which suppresses 
because this hearing has appropriated 
is represented and in this 
cealedly 
way the Self is brought back from  the loud idle talk which goes  with 
the 
common sense of the they Thus the mode of Articulative 
which belongs to 
silent has been characterized 
Anyone who keeps silent when  he wants to give us  to understand some
thing must have something to say In the appeal Dasein gives itself to 
understand 
keepingsilent The  discourse 

discourse 
wanting to have a conscience is  one of reticence 
Keeping 
of discourselx 

This calling is therefore a

Only in keeping silent does the conscience 
comes from the  soundlessness 
summons is called  back into  the  stillness  of 
thing that is to become still  Only  in 
discourse  understood 
takes the words away from the commonsense 
way of interpreting 

the Dasein which it 
itself and called back as some
reticence therefore is  this 

silent 
in wanting to have a conscience 

It 
idle talk of the they 

of uncanniness  and 

The commonsense 

the conscience which sticks 

appropriately 

 

call that is to say  the  call 

of the conscience 
as an 

rigorously to the facts takes the silent discourse 
occasion for passing it off as something which is not at all ascertainable 
The fact that they who hear and understand 
or presentathand 
nothing but loud idle talk cannot report 
conscience 
athand With  this kind 
own failure to hear the call and the fact that its hearing 
very far 

manifestly not present
the they merely covers up its 

on the subterfuge that it is dumb and 

any call is held against the 

of interpretation 

does not reach 

The disclosedness 

of Dasein in wanting to have a conscience is thus 

stateofmind by understanding 
and by discourse 

by anxiety as 

constituted 
of oneself upon ones ownm ost Beingguilty 
This distinctive 
itself by its conscience this reticent 
guilty 

in which one is ready for anxietywe call resolut

is attested in Dasein 

selfprojection upon ones ownmost 

as  a projection 

as reticence 

Being 

Resoluteness 

is a distinctive 

mode  of Daseins disclosedness

 In an 

disclosedness 

tru thx Such truth is primarily 

earlier passage however we have Interpreted 
as the primordial 
nor of any definite way ofbehaving but something essentially 
for Beingintheworld 
existentiale In our ontological clarification 
is in the truth we have called attention 
to the primordial 
this entity as the truth of existence and for the delimitation 
we have referred to the analysis of Daseins 
authenticity 

as such Truth must be conceived as a fundamental 
that Dasein 

disclosedness 
of its character 
xi 

not a quality of judgment 

of the proposition 

of 

constitutive

In resoluteness 

we have now arrived at that truth of Dasein which is 
because it is authentic 

Whenever a  there

How  are  we to obtain the right point of view for analysing

cannot be explained ontically 

withintheworld 

Being along
in terms of the 

this kind of concern Daseins

be derived contrariwise

things with

our dealings 
examples of Being alongside we have chosen the using manipulation 
and  producing 
entiated modes of these that is we have chosen ways of Being  alongside 
what belongs to ones everyday needsxvt  In 
authentic  existence 
concern is a matter of indifference The readytohand 
which we concern ourselves 
were to arise only by the effects of entities 
side the  readytohand 
readytohand 
from this kind of Being But neither are concern as a kind of Being which 
belongs to Dasein and that with which we concern ourselves 
just presentathand 
together 
thing readytohand 
them That which is dealt with if 
same a connection 
rightly understood 
concernful dealings themselves 
furthermore if we miss the phenomenal structure 
of what is dealt with 
then we fail to recognize the existential 
of dealing 
Of course 
we have already made an essential 
gain for the analysis 
which we encounter as closest to us if their  specific 
ment does not get passed over But we must understand 
concernful dealings never dwell with any individual 
Our using  and manipulating 
remains oriented towards some equipmental context 
are searching 
we have in mind is not merely what we are searching 
this nor do we have it in mind in an isolated 
equipmental 
totality 
we go to work  and 

withintheworld

All  the 

for or even primarily 

act but  the range of the 

constitution 

of those entities 

we do not push out from the 

And 

of any  definite 

If for instance  we 

for some equipment which we have misplaced  then  what 

Being and Time 

nothing and come upon some  item of equipment which has been  pre
sented to us in isolation in laying hold of an item of equipment 
back to it from whatever workworld has already been disclosed 

we come 

  The upshot of this 

is that if in our analysis of dealings we aim at that 
alongside the entities 
with 

totality 

a fact ontically 

 The relational 

ontologically 

The kind of talk in 

not towards 
but towards 

its  with 
impossible 

to equipment that is readytohandnamely 

is 
but rather to indicate the kind of 
of 
character 
that an equipment is 
item of equipment may 

which is dealt with then ones existent Being 
which one concerns  oneself 
must be given an orientation 
some isolated item of equipment which is readytohand 
the equipmental 
This way of taking what is dealt with is forced 
upon us also if we  consider that character of Being which belongs dis
involvemenexvu 
tinctively 
We understand the term involvement 
which we say that something has with it an involvement in something 
not meant to establish 
Being that belongs to what is readytohand
involvementof 
ontologically 
be readytohand 
that the very thing 
concernful dealings can let what is readytohand 
spectively 
the involvement 
which discovers 
be involvedthat 
makes up the existential structure 
Letting 
as Being alongside somethi
ng belongs 
of care and care 
in turn is grounded in temporality 
the possibility 
poralizing 

to the essential constitution 
If all this is so then the existential 
of 
in a mode of the tem

which something has  in something 
circumspectively 

    in    suggests 
Of course just a solitary 

only if in these dealings we already  understand 

of letting 
of temporality

things 
 

in concern amounts to letting something 

is to projecting an  involvement

When we are using a tool circumspect

ively we can say for instance 

to a concernful  deliberation  and 

 circumspectively 

that the 

of heaviness  

it exerts a pressure  on 

that the hammer is too heavy or too light Even  the proposition 
hammer is heavy can give expression 
signify that the hamm er is not an easy onein other words  that 
it takes 
force to handle it or that it will be hard to manipulate But this pro
position can also mean that the entity before us which we already know 
as a hammer has a weightthat is to say i t  has the 
what lies beneath it and 
it is no 

property 
it falls if this is removed When this kind 
longer spoken within the horizon of awaiting and retaining 
totality 
from looking at what  is suitable for an entity  with 
sighted something that is suitable 
corporeal 
of 
too heavy or too light no longer has any meaning   that is to say the 
entity in itself as we now encounter it gives us nothing with 
relation to 
which it could be found too heavy or too light

nor because we are just 
we are keeping our distance from manipulation

 Auch der Satz der Hammer ist schwer kann einer besorgenden Oberlegung 
Ausdruck geben und bedeuten er ist nicht Ieicht das heisst er fordert zur Handhabung 
Kraft bzw er wird die Hantierung erschweren Here Heidegger is exploiting 
the double 
meaning of the German pair of adjectives

does not signify the sum of those days which have been allotted 
in its lifetime Though this every

Everyman not always but as a  rule

is a definite how of existence 

something which in an existentiell 

we have often used the expression

Dasein 

lives unto the day in den Tag hineinlebt whether in all its ways of 
behaving or only in certain  ones

To  this how there belongs further the comfortable

whatever the day may bring is 

is determinative

 In the field of these

What seems simpler 

than to characterize

if one makes a more penetrating

upshot is that in this sequence

izing the connectedness 
assumptions 
of Experiences what is

ences which have passed away or are only coming along either are no 
longer or are not yet actual Dasein traverses 
to it between the two boundaries and it does so  in such a way that in 
each case

 If we  have regard for what we have worked out under the title of

of Dasein within 
we cannot carry through a genuine ontological

framework to be presentathand
one is having right now is actual and the boundaries

 At bottom even in the ordinary way of taking the connected

in Dasein itself When however one tacitly

In anaysing the historicality 

of Dasein we shall try 

to show that this entity is 

not temporal because it stands in history 
historical 

and can so exist ony because 

but that on the contrary it exists 
it is temporal in the very basis of its Being

  The Ordinary Understanding of History and Daseins Historiing 

 

Our next 

aim is to find the right position fo

r attacking 

the primordial 

question 

of the essence 

ofhistorythat 

is to say for construing 

historicality 

Being and Time 

This position 

 
existentially 
historica
has in view in using the expressions 
ordinary 
ways 

interpretation 

is designated 

of Dasein 

l We shall begin our study therefore by characterizing 

what one 
and historical 
get used in several 

in the 

These  expressions 

history 

by that which is primordially 

II  

ambiguity 

The most obvious 

of the term history 

been noticed and there is nothing fuzzy about it 
this term may 
of it We shall provisionally 
sense of a science 

mean the historical 

actuality 

eliminate the signification 
historiology

itself 
as well as the possible 

often 
in that 
science 
of history 
in the 

is one that has 

It evinces 

of history 
 
various 
history  has 
of history 

The expression 

significations 

with which one 

has 
as an Object but 

belongs 

is evinced 

the science 

as something 

or other already 

 Among such significa

means no longer presentathan

as that which is past has also the opposite 

understood 
usage This signification 

d or even still 
but without having any effect on the Present

past may well be 
in the kind of talk in 
to history Here 
presentathand 
 Of course 
the 
when 
from history Here by history 
we have 

nor even history 
in view neither 
this very entity itself not  necessarily 
Objectified
tions that in which this entity is 
the preeminent 
which we say that something 
past 
indeed 
historical 
we say One cannot get away 
in view that which is past but which nevertheless 
Howsoever 
to the Present 
in such a way  as to have 
related 
double meaning the 
effects upon it  Thus  the  past 
to the events of 
past belongs 
now for 
that time and in spite of that it can still be presentathand 
instance 
a bit of the 
past is still in the present 

or privatively 
has a remarkable 

in the sense of what is actual now and today and to be 

the remains of a Greek temple 

which is past is understood 

to it either positively 

is still having effects 

signification 

irretrievably 

the historical 

time it belonged 

to an earlier 

to be related 

With  the 

as that 

temple 

What we next have in mind with the term history 

is not so 
much 
the past in the sense of that which is past but rather derivation 
Herk
unft from such a past Anything 
of a becoming 
sometimes 
make such history 
present Here history 
 draws on through the past 

stands in the context 
development 
is sometimes 
a rise 
in this way can at the same time 

which 
and the future On this view 

a context 
the Present 

As epochmaking 

a fall What has a history 

of events and effects 

that has a history 

In such becoming 

it determines 

signifis 

a future in  the 

Further 

the past has no special 
history 

priority 
signifies the totality 
in time and indeed the transformations 
human groupings 

and their cultures 

of those 

entities 

which change 

and vicissitudes 
of men of 

as distinguished 

from Nature 

which 

Here what one has in view 

it is that realm of entities 

which one 

 
is not so much a 

es from Nature by having regard for the way in which mans 
is essentially determined by  spirit 
even though 

in time 

operates 

Being and Time 

u  
likewise 
kind of Beinghistorizingas

in a certain 
Finally 

manner Nature too belongs 
whatever 

has been handed 

and culture 
as thus understo
od 

to history 

down to us is as such 

held to be his

it is something 

If we take these four significations 

which we know historiologically 

torical whether 
thing that has been taken over as selfevident 
together 
Dasein which comes to pass in 
is that specific 
so that the historizing 
and 
in our Beingwithoneanother 
which at the same time has been handed down to us and is continuingly 
effective 

or some
hidden 
with its derivation 
that history 

the upshot is 

historizing 

as history 

which is past 

of existent 

is regarded 

emphasized 

time 

in the sense that gets 
in that they relate 

to man as the 

The four significations 

are connected 

the historizing 

character 

of such events to be 

of processes 

an everchanging 

emerg

of events  In what way does this historizing 

of 

a sequence 

so that on occasion 

belong to Dasein Is Dasein already 

subject of events  How is 
defined Is historizing 
ence and disappearance 
history 
to begin with 
first become historical 
stances Or is the Being 
that anything 
Dasein is historical 
only because 
possible 
function of the past gets particularly 
historizes 

like circumstances 
events 

ofDasein constituted 
and vicissi

when the Dasein which 
in time is characterized 
 

temporally 

in its Being Why  is it that the 
stressed 

by getting  intertwined 

it can get into a history Does Dasein 
with events and circum
first of 

all by historizing 

so 

tudes is ontologically 

factically 

presentathand 

If history belongs 

to Daseins 

Being and this Being is based on tempor

would be easy to begin the existential 

ality then it 
with those characteristics of 
meaning 
privileged 
the way for expounding 

Therefore by characterizing 
position 

analysis 
have a temporal 
which obviously 
the remarkably 
more precisely 
of history 
we shall prepare 
of historicality 

the basic constitution 

the historical 

in the concept 

of the past 

ofhistoricality 

presentathand 

gear for example  

in the 
when it is not yet past Is 

in museums household 

The antiquities  preserved 
still 

How far is such equipment 
let us say only because 

belong to a time which is past yet they are 
Present 
it historical 
logical interest 
ment  can 
historical 
historic
themselves 
today Then are these 

be a historiological 
We repeat the question
al when it is not yet past Or do these Things 

is in itself 
 by what right do we  call 

past 
which are presentathand 

object only because  it 

of antiquarian 

study or national 

something 

historical 
it has become an object of historio

somehow 
this entity 

lore  But such equip

what they were 

have in 

still 

even though they are still presentathand 

Being and Time 

character 

have altered 

historical 

of the equipment 
in the 

does not lie in this transien

of the past 
cel which 

but they are out of use Suppose 

even during the Beingpresentathand 

II  
The gear has become fragile or 

in the course of time But that specific 
it something 

they are no longer They are still definite 
in 

 
Manifestly these  Things 
wormeaten 
which makes 
continues 
museum What then is past in this equipment What were these Things 
which today 
items of equipment 
for use  
use today like many a household 
historic
longer  what 
within which they belonged 
countered 
theworld 
with respect 
ing to  a world that which is now still presentathand 
to the past But what do we signify by saying of a world that 
nevertheless 
er A world is only in the manner of existing 
it is  no  long
which 
factically 

in use or out of use they are no 
they were What is past Nothing else than that world 

as readytohand 
That world is no longer 

and used by a concernful Dasein who wasin

belong
can belong 

heirloom would they then be 

i s as Beinginthew

to that world is still 

that they were still 

of equipment 

al All the 

same whether 

to a context 

and  were 

they are 

however 

not yet 

Dasein 

orld 

en

 

But what was formerly withintheworld 
presentath

and As equipment 

Thus the historical character 

of the antiquities 

that are still preserved 

either 

is  not 

but because 

in the past 

presentathand 

to this only past 

or readytohand   Manifestly 

Dasein is nontransient 

of that Dasein to whose world they belonged 

not Dasein 
can Dasein be past at all if we define past 

Dasein would be historical 
as 
Dasein can 
ily 
it essentia
if it is it exists A Dasein which no 
sense it is 

is grounded 
But according 
in the present  However 
now no longer 
never be past not because 
can never be presentathand 
Rather 
longer exists  however 
rather havingbeenthere dagewe
presentathand 
the fact that they have belonged 
the world of a Dasein that has been  thereand 
derived 
does Dasein first become 
something 
precisely 
historical 
that  has 
been in the sense of having been there or has it been as something 
futural which is making 

strict 
sen The antiquities 
which are  still 
of the past and of history 
as equipment 

have been 
historical 
But 
is no longer there Or is it not 
exists Is Dasein just 

from that world This Dasein is what is 

past in the ontologically 

in so far as it factically 

have a character 

to a world that has been

presentthat 

ing of its temporality

historical 

that  they 

primarily 

in that it 

by reason of 

 

is to say in the temporali
of equipment 

From this provisional 

analysis 

and which is still presentathand 
plain that such entities 
the world But the world has an historical kind 

are historical 

which belongs 
it becomes 
though somehow past 
only by reason of their belonging 

to history 

of Being because 

it makes

attribute 

 
ofDasein It may be shown further that when 
 

II  
up an ontological 
one designates a time as the past the meaning of this is not unequivocal
but the past is manifestly distinct 
we have become acquainted 
unity of Daseins 
ultimately 
dominantly 
of havingbeen when that character 
equiprimordially 

more acute why  is it that the historical

This however only makes the enigma

or to speak more appropriately 

from ones having been with which

for the ecstatical 

We  contend  that 

what is primarily 

historical 

is Dasein That which  is 

withintheworld
 in the  widest  sense  but 

also the 

historical however is what we encounter 

by reason of belonging to

It can be shown that the ordinary

the historical

is still present

of anything presentathand

hand if the temporal

in general 
may be 
 

do not become more historical 

historical but at the same time we have been made to doubt 

athand we  have not only been led back to Dasein as that which is 
primarily 
whether the temporal characterization 
oriented primarily 
Entities 
off into  a past 
which is always farther and farther away so that the oldest of them would 
be the most authentically 
distance 
for the historicality of 
entities 
because these entities 
are not in 
exist temporally in so primordial 
time whether passing  away  or 
ontological 

but because they 
in 
could everby its 

authentically 
time and are timeless 

from now and today is of no primary constitutive 

still coming  along 

al On the other 

by being moved 

historical 

temporal in such a way 
It will be said that these deliberations 

essencebe 

have been rather  petty 
denies that at bottom human Dasein is the primary subject of history 
and the ordinary conception 
plainly enough But with the 
view not just the on tical Fact that in man we are  presented 
or less important 
worldhistory 
remains the plaything 

we have cited says so 
al one has in 
with a more 
and that he

thesis that Dasein is historic

of history  which

and events 

that  are 

No one

This thesis raises the

The authentic existentiell

it that any possibility one 

is lost in the they It understands

Dasein today These possibilities have mostly 
by ambiguity yet they  are 
well known to us

The resoluteness 

lies in making authentic 

in which Dasein comes back 
of authentic 

current 
and discloses them in terms  of the 

that have come down to one but not necessarily 

existing 
as thrown takes over 

 
more authentically 
death it understands 

itself in resoluteness The 
this means that in anticipating 
in terms of its ownmost distinctive 
does it choose and find the possibility 

In ones coming back 
to ones thrownness there is hidden a handing down to oneself of 
as having

resolutely 
the possibilities

and 
taking things lightlyand brings Dasein into  the simplicity

when 
dimensions 

of the appropriate

 Nevertheless 
as a science 

of historiology 

we may venture 

in terms 

will serve to prepare 

us for the 

the history 

of philosophy

which is to be accomplished 

in what followsx 

  The Existential 
We  need not discuss 

Source of Historiology 

in Daseins 

the Fact that historiology 

Historicality 
like any science 
at any time on the 

is  as 

dependent 

a kind of Being of Dasein factically 
worldview Beyond this we must inquire into 
prevailing 
possibility 
of how the sciences 
This source is still 
us our analysis 
will acquaint 
historiology 
 historicality 
temporality 

which lies before 
the existential 
source of 
to light the 
is rooted in 

only to the extent of bringing 
of Dasein and the fact that this  historicality 

In the context 
us in outline  with 

have their source in Daseins state of Being 

not very transparent 

still more 

plainly 

the ontological 

If Daseins 

Being is in principle 

historical 

then every factical 

science 

is 
has 

always manifestly in the grip of this historizing 
Daseins historicality 

as its presupposition 

in its own quite special way 

But historiology still 

This can be made plain in the first instance by the suggestion 

history  must 

presuppose 

of Daseins 

as the science 

Object the entity 

historiology 
possible 
which is primordially 
not only be in order that a historiological 
and historiological 
which Dasein comports 
is factically 
this disclosure has its 
we  have in view when we talk of Daseins 

cognition 
itself 
accomplished 

or not its ontological 
roots in the historicality 

as a historizing 
way in 
is not only historical 
Whether the historiological 
disclosure 
of history 
is such that in itself 

structure 

object may become accessib
le 

of Dasein This is the connection 

historicality 

as the existential

But history must

The issue here is not one of abstracting 

Being ana Time 

signifies 

To cast light 

must be projected ontologically 

upon this connection 

that the idea of historiology 

today nor is it one of assimilating 

from the way something is factically 

II  
source ofhistoriology 
ologically 
terms of Daseins historicality 
the concept of historiology 
the  sciences 
For what guarantee do we have in principle 
in its primordial 
and 
will indeed be properly representative 
ies And even if this should turn out to be the casewe 
authentic 
shall hold back from any decision about thisthen the concept could be 
discovered 
in the Fact only by using the clue provided by the idea of 
historiology as one which we have already understood On the other 
hand the existential 
by having the historian 
is in agreement 
with it Nor does the idea become false if he disputes any such agreement 

done  in 
it to anything of this sort 
that such a factical procedure 

affirm that his factical  behaviour 

idea of historiology 

ofhistoriology 

possibilit

is not given a higher justification 

The idea of historiology 

as a science implies that the disclosure 

of 

entities 

gets projected 

and the conceptual 

Beingintheworld 

in Dasein as disclosed 

is what it has seized upon as its own task Every science 

That which is familiar pre

primarily by thematizing 

is bounded off The ways of access to them get managed method
them is outlined 
of the Present is 
the task of disclosing 

historical 
is constituted 
scientifically 
upon the Being which is specific to it With this projection 
entities 
ologically 
If we may postpone the question of whether a  history 
possible and assign zuweisen 
past then the historiological 
general the past has in each case already been disclosed Quite apart 
from the question of whether sufficient sources are available for the 
of the past  the way to it must in general be 
historiological 
open if we are to go back to it historiologically  It 
that anything of the sort is 

the 
of history is possible only if in 

the case or how this is possible 

is by no means patent 

for interpreting 

to historiology

But in so far as Daseins Being is historicalthat 

is to say in so far as by 

temporality 

historical 

accomplished 

is primordially 

in existence 
that  which 

reason of its ecstaticohorizonal 
it is open in its character of 
havingbeenthe way is in general prepared for such thematizing 
And because Dasein ana 
the past as  can  be 
only Dasein 
thematiz
historiological 
ing presents as a possible object for research 
of Dasein which hasbeen
theworld 
longer then the world too is something that hasbeenthe
in  conflict  with 
hand withintheworld 
that one can in a Present come across historiologically 

there is also in each case worldhistory If Dasein is there no 
re This is not 

the fact that all the same what was formerly readyto

Along with any factical Dasein as Beingin

must have the kind of Being

as something 

does not yet pass away but becomes something

II  
to be Interpreted 
We must show how Dasein 
which relates itself to time by taking it into its reckoning 
previous characterization 
that we have not paid attention 
it also  is 
defective in principle 
rigorous sense of the existentialtemporal 
to temporality 
why it is necessary 
waythe time in  which  entities 
the withintimeness 

of these entities 

of temporality 

occurwill be illuminated 

itself We must come to understand how this 

to all the dimensions 
of this phenomen
on 
because something like worldtime in the 

Thus the time which is familiar to us in the ordinary 

is not only quite incomplete in 

of the world belongs 

conception 

is possible 
and 

and so will 

Thus our 

Everyday Dasein the Dasein which takes time comes across  time 

and 

as readytohand 

in what it encounters 

ed is understood 
Being which is the closest 

 How and why Dasein comes to develop the ordinary 

withintheworld 
The time which it has thus experienc

proximally 
presentathand 
within the horizon of that way of understanding 
for Dasein that is it is understood 
presentathand
conception 
concerning 
The ordinary conception of time owes its origin to a way in which 
primordial 
time has been levelled 
that this is the 
source of the ordinary conception 
as primordial 
time 
of temporality 

of  time must be clarified in terms of its stateofBeing as 
itself 

as something which is itself somehow 

with timea stateofBeing with a temporal foundation 

off By demonstrating

In the development 

of this ordinary conception 

there is a remarkable

ess it  still 

to be attributed 

of time both possibilities 

as to whether the character 

to the soul notwithstanding 

to time is sub
or Objective Where time is taken as being in itself it gets 
preeminently 
And where it has the 

vacillation 
jective 
allotted 
kind of character which belongs to consciousn
Objectively In Hegels Interpretation 
brought to the point where in a certain manner they cancel each other 
out Hegel tries to define the connection 
such a manner as to make intelligible 
time We seem to be in accord with 
tion  we have given

approach and because its  orientation 
that it aims at fundamental ontology 
of taking the relationship 
plain our  existentialontological 
of worldtime 
may settle this in a provisional

a now  that 

    a

it expresses 

interpretatively 

itself too that is to say it expresses 
Being which understands

which interprets

secondly 
itself alsois based upon a makingpresent 

very  addressing

because  this 

by under

interpretable

is ecstatically 

The makingpresent which 

awaits and retains

Articulated

concernful manner it just never understands 
Continuously 
up  the time which Dasein allows itself has gaps in it  as

does that time become and the handier the clock must

whatever way these  questions 
whatever way they may first 
first understand that temporality  as 
something like worldtime which constitutes 
readytohand 
can never be designated 
with a character other than  that of Dasein they are nontemporal 
whether they Really occur arise and pass away or subsist ideally 

as temporal in the strict sense Like every entity 

But in that case such entities 

and the presentathand 

of all get primordially 

a withintimeness

If worldtime 

thus belongs to the temporalizing

then it can

between themonly if we can understand 
how 
just by wavering insecurely

in terms of an under

understand 
of this 
in terms of primor
concept obstruct the possibility 
dial time what is meant by this conceptionthat is the possibility 
of 
it as temporality 
understanding 
The everyday concern which gives itself 
time finds the time in those entities 
tered in time So if we are to cast any light on the genesis of the ordinary 
conception 

to what extent this conception 

of time and the prevalence 

of our understanding

The

of Aristotles 

of time moves rather in the direction of 
Being Yet because this very understand

as it at first seems strange and has been genuinely derived 

in principle if the formulation of this question in 

first glance but if one  defines the existential

from which Aristotle 

has taken it one sees that it is as 

for the question of Being that the Aristotelian 

thematically 

and awaiting 

interpretation 

with all its critical 

limitations 

is to be appropriated 

in 

all discussions 

Ever since Aristotle 

in principle to the Aristotelian 
theme they have taken it as it shows itself in circumspective 
Time is what is counted that is  to say it is what is expressed 
we have in view even if unthematically 
the shadow is made present When one makes present  that

When the concern which  gives  itself  time 

reckons with time  the 

such 

it is  lost 

does so the less it dwells 

at the expressed time as 

in the equipment with which it concerns itself 

more naturally it 
on the contrary 
which in each case has a time of its own When concern determines  the 
time and assigns it the more  naturally 
directed towards treating time as such thematicallyall 
the Being which is alongside 
as it  makes present say unhesitatingly 
uttered  now 
ordinary understanding 
passing  away 
which are constantly  presentat
hand simultaneously 
and coming along Time is understood as a succession 
as a flowing 
stream of nows as the course of time What is implied by such an 
interpretation 

it does sothat is the less it is 
the more does 
the object of concern the Being which falls 
whether or not anything is 
former occasion Thus for the 

of time time shows itself as a sequence of nows 

of the worldtime with which we concern 

or then  or  on  that 

ourselves   

We get the answer if we go back to thefull essential structure 

of world

This is grounded 

of temporality 

The  now is essentially 

or inappropriate 

with which the ordinary understanding 
as the first essential 

time and compare this with  that 
of time is acquainted We have exhibited datability 
item in the time with which we concern ourselves 
in the ecstatical  constitution 
a now that      The datable now which is understood 
in concern 
even if we cannot grasp it as such is in each case one which is either 
appropriate 
now We have accordingly 
ourselves worldtime  In the ordinary interpretations 
sequence of nows both datability 
two structures 
acterized 
them up When these are covered up  the ecstaticohorizonal 
of the now 
of temporality 
are grounded gets levelled 
as 
it  were and as thus shorn they simply range themselves 
along after one 
another so as to make up the succession 
It is no accident that worldtime 

Significance belongs to the structure 
called the time with which we concern 
of time as  a 
are missing 
These 
are not permitted to  come to the fore when  time is char

off The nows get shorn of these relations 

The ordinary interpretation 

in which the  datability 

as a pure succession 

and the significance 

of time covers 
constitution 

thus gets levelled 

and significance 

off and covered up 

of the

II  
interpretation

the commonsense

stood in ones concern with the presentathand 
Now so far as this concern with time comes back to the time itself

nows which indeed are also somehow there

Thus the nows are in a certain manner 
are encountered 
that the nows are presentathand 
get seen 
The nows pass away and those which have  passed  away 
past The nows come along 
future The ordinary interpretation 
of worldtime as nowtime never 
avails itself of the horizon by which such things as world significance 
and datability 
remain 
covered up all the more so because this coveringup 
way in which the ordinary interpretation 
time conceptually 

necessarily 
is reinforced by the 
of 

can be made accessible These structures 

within the horizon of that 

in the same way as Things they still

The sequence of nows is taken as something that is somehow present

in every now it

 thus it is time in the sense of the notyet

This thesis becomes possible only on the basis of an orientation 
towards a 
freefloating initself 
orientation 
up with regard  to

towards Beingpresentathand

prompted by his arduous struggle to conceive the concretion

chapter of his Phenomenology of the Spirit Thus time appears as  the very

The  reader 

which German expressions 

Being and Time i s  a work of many interwoven themes where words are  used in 
strange ways made stranger still by the shift to another language 
must 
constantly remind himself of how specific expressions are used and he must recall 
the contexts in which they have appeared before In our index of English expres
sions we have tried to list most of those which he may have occasion to look up 
indicating 
the 
chief passages

the German text or who has read  other 
theories and wants to know  how we have handled specific 
taken  the  reader 
into our confidence as it were  exposing 
consistency with which many expressions 
departures from consistency 
warranted 

they have been  used to translate  and 
in which they appear  We have also provided a GermanEnglish

not only the pedantic 

discussions 

when  a  little  more  pedantry  might  have 

Rather than overloading 

the index and glossary with trivial details 

we have 
expressions which belong to the same 

made no effort to list all the  important 
family but have usually chosen one or two to serve as representatives 
We have however used the expression But cf to introduce members 
which have

of the family

we have usually indicated 

In both the index and the glossary we have usually tried to list all the equiva
of each family for which an entry is made In those cases

are 
In the index an asterisk  attached to a

where our list is incomplete 
can assure the reader that most of the expressions covered by this abbreviation 
of little philosophical 
German  expression

Similarly 
which again to the best of our knowledge have been used solely to translate 
the 
corresponding German  expression 
are listed we

When an English expression

we have often confined our 
of which only one or two are of philosophical 
index references explicitly 
have 
been used to  translate the same German word we  have sometimes found it 
convenient to put all the references together under a single entry See for example 
our entries for  assign and refer 

to these When two or more English  expressions

occurs Indeed there are several  express

we have some

this with a dagger

The fullness and
