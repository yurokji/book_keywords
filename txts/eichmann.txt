Note to the Reader 
 
 
This is a revised and enlarged edition of the book which first appeared in May  I covered 
the Eichmann trial at Jerusalem in  for The New Yorker where this account slightly 
abbreviated was originally published in February and March  The book was written in the 
summer and fall of  and finished in November of that year during my stay as a Fellow of the 
Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University 
The revisions for this edition concern about a dozen technical errors none of which has any 
bearing on the analysis or argument of the original text The factual record of the period in 
question has not yet been established in all its details and there are certain matters on which an 
informed guess will probably never be superseded by completely reliable information Thus the 
total number of Jewish victims of the Final Solution is a guess  between four and a half and six 
million  that has never been verified and the same is true of the totals for each of the countries 
concerned Some new material especially on Holland came to light after the publication of this 
book but none of it was important for the event as a whole 
Most of the additions are also of a technical nature clarifying a particular point introducing new 
facts or in some instances quotations from different sources These new sources have been 
added to the Bibliography and are discussed in the new Postscript which deals with the 
controversy that followed the original publication Apart from the Postscript the only nontechnical 
addition concerns the German antiHitler conspiracy of July   which I had mentioned only 
incidentally in the original version The character of the book as a whole is completely unaltered 
Thanks are due to Richard and Clara Winston for their help in preparing the text of the Postscript 
for this edition

 The House of Justice 
 
 
Beth Hamishpath  the House of Justice these words shouted by the court usher at the top of 
his voice make us jump to our feet as they announce the arrival of the three judges who bare
headed in black robes walk into the courtroom from a side entrance to take their seats on the 
highest tier of the raised platform Their long table soon to be covered with innumerable books 
and more than fifteen hundred documents is flanked at each end by the court stenographers 
Directly below the judges are the translators whose services are needed for direct exchanges 
between the defendant or his counsel and the court otherwise the Germanspeaking accused 
party like almost everyone else in the audience follows the Hebrew proceedings through the 
simultaneous radio transmission which is excellent in French bearable in English and sheer 
comedy frequently incomprehensible in German In view of the scrupulous fairness of all 
technical arrangements for the trial it is among the minor mysteries of the new State of Israel 
that with its high percentage of Germanborn people it was unable to find an adequate translator 
into the only language the accused and his counsel could understand For the old prejudice 
against German Jews once very pronounced in Israel is no longer strong enough to account for 
it Remains as explication the even older and still very powerful Vitamin P as the Israelis call 
protection in government circles and the bureaucracy One tier below the translators facing each 
other and hence with their profiles turned to the audience we see the glass booth of the accused 
and the witness box Finally on the bottom tier with their backs to the audience are the 
prosecutor with his staff of four assistant attorneys and the counsel for the defense who during 
the first weeks is accompanied by an assistant 
 

At no time is there anything theatrical in the conduct of the judges Their walk is unstudied their 
sober and intense attention visibly stiffening under the impact of grief as they listen to the tales of 
suffering is natural their impatience with the prosecutors attempt to drag out these hearings 
forever is spontaneous and refreshing their attitude to the defense perhaps a shade overpolite 
as though they had always in mind that Dr Servatius stood almost alone in this strenuous battle 
in an unfamiliar environment their manner toward the accused always beyond reproach They 
are so obviously three good and honest men that one is not surprised that none of them yields to 
the greatest temptation to playact in this setting  that of pretending that they all three born and 
educated in Germany must wait for the Hebrew translation Moshe Landau the presiding judge 
hardly ever withholds his answer until the translator has done his work and he frequently 
interferes in the translation correcting and improving evidently grateful for this bit of distraction 
from an otherwise grim business Months later during the crossexamination of the accused he 
will even lead his colleagues to use their German mother tongue in the dialogue with Eichmann  
a proof if proof were still needed of his remarkable independence of current public opinion in 
Israel 
There is no doubt from the very beginning that it is Judge Landau who sets the tone and that he 
is doing his best his very best to prevent this trial from becoming a show trail under the influence 
of the prosecutors love of showmanship Among the reasons he cannot always succeed is the 
simple fact that the proceedings happen on a stage before an audience with the ushers 
marvelous shout at the beginning of each session producing the effect of the rising curtain 
Whoever planned this auditorium in the newly built Beth Haam the House of the People now 
surrounded by high fences guarded from roof to cellar by heavily armed police and with a row of 
wooden barracks in the front courtyard in which all comers arc expertly frisked had a theater in 
mind complete with orchestra and gallery with proscenium and stage and with side doors for the 
actors entrance Clearly this courtroom is not a bad place for the show trial David BenGurion 
Prime Minister of Israel had in mind when he decided to have Eichmann kidnaped in Argentina 
and brought to the District Court of Jerusalem to stand trial for his role in the final solution of the 
Jewish question And BenGurion rightly called the architect of the state remains the invisible 
stage manager of the proceedings Not once does he attend a session in the courtroom he 
speaks with the voice of Gideon Hausner the Attorney General who representing the 
government does his best his very best to obey his master And if fortunately his best often 
turns out not to be good enough the reason is that the trial is presided over by someone who 
serves Justice as faithfully as Mr Hausner serves the State of Israel Justice demands that the 
accused be prosecuted defended and judged and that all the other questions of seemingly 
greater import  of How could it happen and Why did it happen of Why the Jews and 
Why the Germans of What was the role of other nations and What was the extent of co
responsibility on the side of the Allies of How could the Jews through their own leaders 
cooperate in their own destruction and Why did they go to their death like lambs to the 
slaughter  be left in abeyance Justice insists on the importance of Adolf Eichmann son of Karl 
Adolf Eichmann the man in the glass booth built for his protection mediumsized slender 
middleaged with receding hair illfitting teeth and nearsighted eyes who throughout the trial 
keeps craning his scraggy neck toward the bench not once does he face the audience and who 
desperately and for the most part successfully maintains his selfcontrol despite the nervous tic to 
which his mouth must have become subject long before this trial started On trial are his deeds 
not the sufferings of the Jews not the German people or mankind not even antiSemitism and 
racism 
And Justice though perhaps an abstraction for those of Mr BenGurions turn of mind proves 
to be a much sterner master than the Prime Minister with all his power The latters rule as Mr 
Hausner is not slow in demonstrating is permissive it permits the prosecutor to give press
conferences and interviews for television during the trial the American program sponsored by 
the Glickman Corporation is constantly interrupted  business as usual  by realestate 
advertising and even spontaneous outbursts to reporters in the court building  he is sick of 
crossexamining Eichmann who answers all questions with lies it permits frequent side glances 
into the audience and the theatrics characteristic of a more than ordinary vanity which finally 
achieves its triumph in the White House with a compliment on a job well done by the President 
of the United States Justice does not permit anything of the sort it demands seclusion it permits 

sorrow rather than anger and it prescribes the most careful abstention from all the nice pleasures 
of putting oneself in the limelight Judge Landaus visit to this country shortly after the trial was not 
publicized except among the Jewish organizations for which it was undertaken 
Yet no matter how consistently the judges shunned the limelight there they were seated at the 
top of the raised platform facing the audience as from the stage in a play The audience was 
supposed to represent the whole world and in the first few weeks it indeed consisted chiefly of 
newspapermen and magazine writers who had flocked to Jerusalem from the four corners of the 
earth They were to watch a spectacle as sensational as the Nuremberg Trials only this time the 
tragedy of Jewry as a whole was to be the central concern For if we shall charge Eichmann 
also with crimes against nonJews    this is not because he committed them but surprisingly 
because we make no ethnic distinctions Certainly a remarkable sentence for a prosecutor to 
utter in his opening speech it proved to be the key sentence in the case for the prosecution For 
this case was built on what the Jews had suffered not on what Eichmann had done And 
according to Mr Hausner this distinction would be immaterial because there was only one man 
who had been concerned almost entirely with the Jews whose business had been their 
destruction whose role in the establishment of the iniquitous regime had been limited to them 
That was Adolf Eichmann Was it not logical to bring before the court all the facts of Jewish 
suffering which of course were never in dispute and then look for evidence which in one way or 
another would connect Eichmann with what had happened The Nuremberg Trials where the 
defendants had been indicted for crimes against the members of various nations had left the 
Jewish tragedy out of account for the simple reason that Eichmann had not been there 
Did Mr Hausner really believe the Nuremberg Trials would have paid greater attention to the fate 
of the Jews if Eichmann had been in the dock Hardly Like almost everybody else in Israel he 
believed that only a Jewish court could render justice to Jews and that it was the business of 
Jews to sit in judgment on their enemies Hence the almost universal hostility in Israel to the mere 
mention of an international court which would have indicted Eichmann not for crimes against the 
Jewish people but for crimes against mankind committed on the body of the Jewish people 
Hence the strange boast We make no ethnic distinctions which sounded less strange in Israel 
where rabbinical law rules the personal status of Jewish citizens with the result that no Jew can 
marry a nonJew marriages concluded abroad are recognized but children of mixed marriages 
are legally bastards children of Jewish parentage born out of wedlock are legitimate and if one 
happens to have a nonJewish mother he can neither be married nor buried The outrage in this 
state of affairs has become more acute since  when a sizable portion of jurisdiction in 
matters of family law was handed over to the secular courts Women can now inherit property and 
in general enjoy equal status with men Hence it is hardly respect for the faith or the power of the 
fanatically religious minority that prevents the government of Israel from substituting secular 
jurisdiction for rabbinical law in matters of marriage and divorce Israeli citizens religious and 
nonreligious seem agreed upon the desirability of having a law which prohibits intermarriage and 
it is chiefly for this reason  as Israeli officials outside the courtroom were willing to admit  that 
they are also agreed upon the undesirability of a written constitution in which such a law would 
embarrassingly have to be spelled out The argument against civil marriage is that it would split 
the House of Israel and would also separate Jews of this country from Jews of the Diaspora as 
Philip Gillon recently put it in Jewish Frontier Whatever the reasons there certainly was 
something breathtaking in the naivet with which the prosecution denounced the infamous 
Nuremberg Laws of  which had prohibited intermarriage and sexual intercourse between 
Jews and Germans The better informed among the correspondents were well aware of the irony 
but they did not mention it in their reports This they figured was not the time to tell the Jews 
what was wrong with the laws and institutions of their own country 
If the audience at the trial was to be the world and the play the huge panorama of Jewish 
sufferings the reality was falling short of expectations and purposes The journalists remained 
faithful for not much more than two weeks after which the audience changed drastically It was 
now supposed to consist of Israelis of those who were too young to know the story or as in the 
case of Oriental Jews had never been told it The trial was supposed to show them what it meant 
to live among nonJews to convince them that only in Israel could a Jew be safe and live an 
honorable life For correspondents the lesson was spelled out in a little booklet on Israels legal 
system which was handed to the press Its author Doris Lankin cites a Supreme Court decision 

whereby two fathers who had abducted their children and brought them to Israel were directed 
to send them back to their mothers who living abroad had a legal right to their custody And this 
adds the author  no less proud of such strict legality than Mr Hausner of his willingness to 
prosecute murder even when the victims were nonJews  despite the fact that to send the 
children back to maternal custody and care would be committing them to waging an unequal 
struggle against the hostile elements in the Diaspora But in this audience there were hardly any 
young people and it did not consist of Israelis as distinguished from Jews It was filled with 
survivors with middleaged and elderly people immigrants from Europe like myself who knew 
by heart all there was to know and who were in no mood to learn any lessons and certainly did 
not need this trial to draw their own conclusions As witness followed witness and horror was 
piled upon horror they sat there and listened in public to stories they would hardly have been 
able to endure in private when they would have had to face the storyteller And the more the 
calamity of the Jewish people in this generation unfolded and the more grandiose Mr Hausners 
rhetoric became the paler and more ghostlike became the figure in the glass booth and no 
fingerwagging And there sits the monster responsible for all this could shout him back to life 
It was precisely the play aspect of the trial that collapsed under the weight of the hairraising 
atrocities A trial resembles a play in that both begin and end with the doer not with the victim A 
show trial needs even more urgently than an ordinary trial a limited and welldefined outline of 
what was done and how it was done In the center of a trial can only be the one who did  in this 
respect he is like the hero in the play  and if he suffers he must suffer for what he has done not 
for what he has caused others to suffer No one knew this better than the presiding judge before 
whose eyes the trial began to degenerate into a bloody show a rudderless ship tossed about on 
the waves But if his efforts to prevent this were often defeated the defeat was strangely in part 
the fault of the defense which hardly ever rose to challenge any testimony no matter how 
irrelevant and immaterial it might be Dr Servatius as everybody invariably addressed him was a 
bit bolder when it came to the submission of documents and the most impressive of his rare 
interventions occurred when the prosecution introduced as evidence the diaries of Hans Frank 
former Governor General of Poland and one of the major war criminals hanged at Nuremberg I 
have only one question Is the name Adolf Eichmann the name of the accused mentioned in 
those twentynine volumes in fact there were thirtyeight    The name Adolf Eichmann is not 
mentioned in all those twentynine volumes    Thank you no more questions 
Thus the trial never became a play but the show BenGurion had had in mind to begin with did 
take place or rather the lessons he thought should be taught to Jews and Gentiles to Israelis 
and Arabs in short to the whole world These lessons to be drawn from an identical show were 
meant to be different for the different recipients BenGurion had outlined them before the trial 
started in a number of articles designed to explain why Israel had kidnaped the accused There 
was the lesson to the nonJewish world We want to establish before the nations of the world 
how millions of people because they happened to be Jews and one million babies because they 
happened to be Jewish babies were murdered by the Nazis Or in the words of Davar the 
organ of Mr BenGurions Mapai party Let world opinion know this that not only Nazi Germany 
was responsible for the destruction of six million Jews of Europe Hence again in BenGurions 
own words We want the nations of the world to know    and they should be ashamed The 
Jews in the Diaspora were to remember how Judaism four thousand years old with its spiritual 
creations and its ethical strivings its Messianic aspirations had always faced a hostile world 
how the Jews had degenerated until they went to their death like sheep and how only the 
establishment of a Jewish state had enabled Jews to hit back as Israelis had done in the War of 
Independence in the Suez adventure and in the almost daily incidents on Israels unhappy 
borders And if the Jews outside Israel had to be shown the difference between Israeli heroism 
and Jewish submissive meekness there was a lesson for those inside Israel too the generation 
of Israelis who have grown up since the holocaust were in danger of losing their ties with the 
Jewish people and by implication with their own history It is necessary that our youth 
remember what happened to the Jewish people We want them to know the most tragic facts in 
our history Finally one of the motives in bringing Eichmann to trial was to ferret out other Nazis 
 for example the connection between the Nazis and some Arab rulers 
If these had been the only justifications for bringing Adolf Eichmann to the District Court of 
Jerusalem the trial would have been a failure on most counts In some respects the lessons 

were superfluous and in others positively misleading AntiSemitism has been discredited thanks 
to Hitler perhaps not forever but certainly for the time being and this not because the Jews have 
become more popular all of a sudden but because in Mr BenGurions own words most people 
have realized that in our day the gas chamber and the soap factory are what antiSemitism may 
lead to Equally superfluous was the lesson to the Jews in the Diaspora who hardly needed the 
great catastrophe in which onethird of their people perished to be convinced of the worlds 
hostility Not only has their conviction of the eternal and ubiquitous nature of antiSemitism been 
the most potent ideological factor in the Zionist movement since the Dreyfus Affair it was also the 
cause of the otherwise inexplicable readiness of the German Jewish community to negotiate with 
the Nazi authorities during the early stages of the regime 
Needless to say these negotiations were separated by an abyss from the later collaboration of 
the Judenrte No moral questions were involved yet only a political decision whose realism 
was debatable concrete help thus the argument ran was better than abstract denunciations 
It was Realpolitik without Machiavellian overtones and its dangers came to light years later after 
the outbreak of the war when these daily contacts between the Jewish organizations and the 
Nazi bureaucracy made it so much easier for the Jewish functionaries to cross the abyss between 
helping Jews to escape and helping the Nazis to deport them It was this conviction which 
produced the dangerous inability of the Jews to distinguish between friend and foe and German 
Jews were not the only ones to underestimate their enemies because they somehow thought that 
all Gentiles were alike If Prime Minister BenGurion to all practical purposes the head of the 
Jewish State meant to strengthen this kind of Jewish consciousness he was ill advised for a 
change in this mentality is actually one of the indispensable prerequisites for Israeli statehood 
which by definition has made of the Jews a people among peoples a nation among nations a 
state among states depending now on a plurality which no longer permits the ageold and 
unfortunately religiously anchored dichotomy of Jews and Gentiles 
The contrast between Israeli heroism and the submissive meekness with which Jews went to 
their death  arriving on time at the transportation points walking on their own feet to the places of 
execution digging their own graves undressing and making neat piles of their clothing and lying 
down side by side to be shot  seemed a fine point and the prosecutor asking witness after 
witness Why did you not protest Why did you board the train Fifteen thousand people 
were standing there and hundreds of guards facing you  why didnt you revolt and charge and 
attack was elaborating it for all it was worth But the sad truth of the matter is that the point was 
ill taken for no nonJewish group or people had behaved differently Sixteen years ago while still 
under the direct impact of the events David Rousset a former inmate of Buchenwald described 
what we know happened in all concentration camps The triumph of the SS demands that the 
tortured victim allow himself to be led to the noose without protesting that he renounce and 
abandon himself to the point of ceasing to affirm his identity And it is not for nothing It is not 
gratuitously out of sheer sadism that the SS men desire his defeat They know that the system 
which succeeds in destroying its victim before he mounts the scaffold    is incomparably the 
best for keeping a whole people in slavery In submission Nothing is more terrible than these 
processions of human beings going like dummies to their deaths Les lours de notre mort  
The court received no answer to this cruel and silly question but one could easily have found an 
answer had he permitted his imagination to dwell for a few minutes on the fate of those Dutch 
Jews who in  in the old Jewish quarter of Amsterdam dared to attack a German security 
police detachment Four hundred and thirty Jews were arrested in reprisal and they were literally 
tortured to death first in Buchenwald and then in the Austrian camp of Mauthausen For months 
on end they died a thousand deaths and every single one of them would have envied his 
brethren in Auschwitz and even in Riga and Minsk There exist many things considerably worse 
than death and the SS saw to it that none of them was ever very far from their victims minds 
and imagination In this respect perhaps even more significantly than in others the deliberate 
attempt at the trial to tell only the Jewish side of the story distorted the truth even the Jewish 
truth The glory of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto and the heroism of the few others who 
fought back lay precisely in their having refused the comparatively easy death the Nazis offered 
thembefore the firing squad or in the gas chamber And the witnesses in Jerusalem who testified 
to resistance and rebellion to the small place it had in the history of the holocaust confirmed 
once more the fact that only the very young had been capable of taking the decision that we 

cannot go and be slaughtered like sheep 
 
In one respect Mr BenGurions expectations for the trial were not altogether disappointed it did 
indeed become an important instrument for ferreting out other Nazis and criminals but not in the 
Arab countries which had openly offered refuge to hundreds of them The Grand Muftis 
connections with the Nazis during the war were no secret he had hoped they would help him in 
the implementation of some final solution in the Near East Hence newspapers in Damascus 
and Beirut in Cairo and Jordan did not hide their sympathy for Eichmann or their regret that he 
had not finished the job a broadcast from Cairo on the day the trial opened even injected a 
slightly antiGerman note into its comments complaining that there was not a single incident in 
which one German plane flew over one Jewish settlement and dropped one bomb on it 
throughout the last world war That Arab nationalists have been in sympathy with Nazism is 
notorious their reasons are obvious and neither BenGurion nor this trial was needed to ferret 
them out they never were in hiding The trial revealed only that all rumors about Eichmanns 
connection with Haj Amin el Husseini the former Mufti of Jerusalem were unfounded He had 
been introduced to the Mufti during an official reception along with all other departmental heads 
The Mufti had been in close contact with the German Foreign Office and with Himmler but this 
was nothing new 
If BenGurions remark about the connection between Nazis and some Arab rulers was 
pointless his failure to mention presentday West Germany in this context was surprising Of 
course it was reassuring to hear that Israel does not hold Adenauer responsible for Hitler and 
that for us a decent German although he belongs to the same nation that twenty years ago 
helped to murder millions of Jews is a decent human being There was no mention of decent 
Arabs The German Federal Republic although it has not yet recognized the State of Israel  
presumably out of fear that the Arab countries might recognize Ulbrichts Germany  has paid 
seven hundred and thirtyseven million dollars in reparation to Israel during the last ten years 
these payments will soon come to an end and Israel is now trying to negotiate a longterm loan 
from West Germany Hence the relationship between the two countries and particularly the 
personal relationship between BenGurion and Adenauer has been quite good and if as an 
aftermath of the trial some deputies in the Knesset the Israeli Parliament succeeded in 
imposing certain restraints on the culturalexchange program with West Germany this certainly 
was neither foreseen nor hoped for by BenGurion It is more noteworthy that he had not 
foreseen or did not care to mention that Eichmanns capture would trigger the first serious effort 
made by Germany to bring to trial at least those who were directly implicated in murder The 
Central Agency for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes belatedly founded by the West German state 
in  and headed by Prosecutor Erwin Schle had run into all kinds of difficulties caused 
partly by the unwillingness of German witnesses to cooperate and partly by the unwillingness of 
the local courts to prosecute on the basis of the material sent them from the Central Agency Not 
that the trial in Jerusalem produced any important new evidence of the kind needed for the 
discovery of Eichmanns associates but the news of Eichmanns sensational capture and of the 
impending trial had sufficient impact to persuade the local courts to use Mr Schles findings and 
to overcome the native reluctance to do anything about murderers in our midst by the time
honored means of posting rewards for the capture of wellknown criminals 
The results were amazing Seven months after Eichmanns arrival in Jerusalem  and four months 
before the opening of the trial  Richard Baer successor to Rudolf Hss as Commandant of 
Auschwitz could finally be arrested In rapid succession most of the members of the socalled 
Eichmann Commando  Franz Novak who lived as a printer in Austria Dr Otto Hunsche who 
had settled as a lawyer in West Germany Hermann Krumey who had become a druggist Gustav 
Richter former Jewish adviser in Rumania and Willi Zpf who had filled the same post in 
Amsterdam  were arrested also although evidence against them had been published in 
Germany years before in books and magazine articles not one of them had found it necessary to 
live under an assumed name For the first time since the close of the war German newspapers 
were full of reports on the trials of Nazi criminals all of them mass murderers after May  
the month of Eichmanns capture only firstdegree murder could be prosecuted all other 
offenses were wiped out by the statute of limitations which is twenty years for murder and the 
reluctance of the local courts to prosecute these crimes showed itself only in the fantastically 

lenient sentences meted out to the accused Thus Dr Otto Bradfisch of the Einsatzgruppen the 
mobile killing units of the SS in the East was sentenced to ten years of hard labor for the killing 
of fifteen thousand Jews Dr Otto Hunsche Eichmanns legal expert and personally responsible 
for a lastminute deportation of some twelve hundred Hungarian Jews of whom at least six 
hundred were killed received a sentence of five years of hard labor and Joseph Lechthaler who 
had liquidated the Jewish inhabitants of Slutsk and Smolevichi in Russia was sentenced to 
three years and six months Among the new arrests were people of great prominence under the 
Nazis most of whom had already been denazified by the German courts One of them was SS 
General Karl Wolff former chief of Himmlers personal staff who according to a document 
submitted in  at Nuremberg had greeted with particular joy the news that for two weeks 
now a train has been carrying every day five thousand members of the Chosen People from 
Warsaw to Treblinka one of the Eastern killing centers Another was Wilhelm Koppe who had at 
first managed the gassing in Chelmno and then become successor to FriedrichWilhelm Krger in 
Poland One of the most prominent among the Higher SS Leaders whose task it had been to 
make Poland judenrein in postwar Germany Koppe was director of a chocolate factory Harsh 
sentences were occasionally meted out but were even less reassuring when they went to such 
offenders as Erich von dem BachZelewski former General of the Higher SS and Police Leader 
Corps He had been tried in  for his participation in the Rohm rebellion in  and 
sentenced to three and one half years he was then indicted again in  for the killing of six 
German Communists in  tried before a jury in Nuremberg and sentenced to life Neither 
indictment mentioned that BachZelewski had been antipartisan chief on the Eastern front or that 
he had participated in the Jewish massacres at Minsk and Mogilev in White Russia Should 
German courts on the pretext that war crimes are no crimes make ethnic distinctions Or is it 
possible that what was an unusually harsh sentence at least in German postwar courts was 
arrived at because BachZelewski was among the very few who actually had suffered a nervous 
breakdown after the mass killings had tried to protect Jews from the Einsatzgruppen and had 
testified for the prosecution at Nuremberg He was also the only one in this category who in  
had denounced himself publicly for mass murder but he was never prosecuted for it 
There is little hope that things will change now even though the Adenauer administration has 
been forced to weed out of the judiciary more than a hundred and forty judges and prosecutors 
along with many police officers with more than ordinarily compromising pasts and to dismiss 
Wolfgang Immerwahr Frnkel the chief prosecutor of the Federal Supreme Court because his 
middle name notwithstanding he had been less than candid when asked about his Nazi past It 
has been estimated that of the eleven thousand five hundred judges in the Bundesrepublik five 
thousand were active in the courts under the Hitler regime In November  shortly after the 
purging of the judiciary and six months after Eichmanns name had disappeared from the news 
the long awaited trial of Martin Fellenz took place at Flensburg in an almost empty courtroom 
The former Higher SS and Police Leader who had been a prominent member of the Free 
Democratic Party in Adenauers Germany was arrested in June  a few weeks after 
Eichmanns capture He was accused of participation in and partial responsibility for the murder of 
forty thousand Jews in Poland After more than six weeks of detailed testimony the prosecutor 
demanded the maximum penalty  a life sentence of hard labor And the court sentenced Fellenz 
to four years two and a half of which he had already served while waiting in jail to be tried Be 
that as it may there is no doubt that the Eichmann trial had its most farreaching consequences 
in Germany The attitude of the German people toward their own past which all experts on the 
German question had puzzled over for fifteen years could hardly have been more clearly 
demonstrated they themselves did not much care one way or the other and did not particularly 
mind the presence of murderers at large in the country since none of them were likely to commit 
murder of their own free will however if world opinion  or rather what the Germans called das 
Ausland collecting all countries outside Germany into a singular noun  became obstinate and 
demanded that these people be punished they were perfectly willing to oblige at least up to a 
point 
Chancellor Adenauer had foreseen embarrassment and voiced his apprehension that the trial 
would stir up again all the horrors and produce a new wave of antiGerman feeling throughout 
the world as indeed it did During the ten months that Israel needed to prepare the trial Germany 
was busy bracing herself against its predictable results by showing an unprecedented zeal for 

searching out and prosecuting Nazi criminals within the country But at no time did either the 
German authorities or any significant segment of public opinion demand Eichmanns extradition 
which seemed the obvious move since every sovereign state is jealous of its right to sit in 
judgment on its own offenders The official position of the Adenauer government that this was 
not possible because there existed no extradition treaty between Israel and Germany is not valid 
that meant only that Israel could not have been forced to extradite Fritz Bauer Attorney General 
of Hessen saw the point and applied to the federal government in Bonn to start extradition 
proceedings But Mr Bauers feelings in this matter were the feelings of a German Jew and they 
were not shared by German public opinion his application was not only refused by Bonn it was 
hardly noticed and remained totally unsupported Another argument against extradition offered 
by the observers the West German government sent to Jerusalem was that Germany had 
abolished capital punishment and hence was unable to mete out the sentence Eichmann 
deserved In view of the leniency shown by German courts to Nazi mass murderers it is difficult 
not to suspect bad faith in this objection Surely the greatest political hazard of an Eichmann trial 
in Germany would have been acquittal for lack of mens rea as J J Jansen pointed out in the 
Rheinischer Merkur August   
There is another more delicate and politically more relevant side to this matter It is one thing to 
ferret out criminals and murderers from their hiding places and it is another thing to find them 
prominent and flourishing in the public realm  to encounter innumerable men in the federal and 
state administrations and generally in public office whose careers had bloomed under the Hitler 
regime True if the Adenauer administration had been too sensitive about employing officials with 
a compromising Nazi past there might have been no administration at all For the truth is of 
course the exact opposite of Dr Adenauers assertion that only a relatively small percentage of 
Germans had been Nazis and that a great majority had been happy to help their Jewish fellow
citizens when they could At least one German newspaper the Frankfurter Rundschau asked 
itself the obvious question long overdue  why so many people who must have known for 
instance the record of the chief prosecutor had kept silent  and then came up with the even 
more obvious answer Because they themselves felt incriminated The logic of the Eichmann 
trial as BenGurion conceived of it with its stress on general issues to the detriment of legal 
niceties would have demanded exposure of the complicity of all German offices and authorities in 
the Final Solution  of all civil servants in the state ministries of the regular armed forces with 
their General Staff of the judiciary and of the business world But although the prosecution as 
conducted by Mr Hausner went as far afield as to put witness after witness on the stand who 
testified to things that while gruesome and true enough had no or only the slightest connection 
with the deeds of the accused it carefully avoided touching upon this highly explosive matter  
upon the almost ubiquitous complicity which had stretched far beyond the ranks of Party 
membership There were widespread rumors prior to the trial that Eichmann had named several 
hundred prominent personalities of the Federal Republic as his accomplices but these rumors 
were not true In his opening speech Mr Hausner mentioned Eichmanns accomplices in the 
crime who were neither gangsters nor men of the underworld and promised that we should 
encounter them  doctors and lawyers scholars bankers and economists  in those councils 
that resolved to exterminate the Jews This promise was not kept nor could it have been kept in 
the form in which it was made For there never existed a council that resolved anything and the 
robed dignitaries with academic degrees never decided on the extermination of the Jews they 
only came together to plan the necessary steps in carrying out an order given by Hitler Still one 
such case was brought to the attention of the court that of Dr Hans Globke one of Adenauers 
closest advisers who more than twentyfive years ago was coauthor of an infamous 
commentary on the Nuremberg Laws and somewhat later author of the brilliant idea of 
compelling all German Jews to take Israel or Sarah as a middle name But Mr Globkes name 
 and only his name  was inserted into the District Court proceedings by the defense and 
probably only in the hope of persuading the Adenauer government to start extradition 
proceedings At any rate the former Ministerialrat of the Interior and present Staatssekretr in 
Adenauers Chancellery doubtless had more right than the exMufti of Jerusalem to figure in the 
history of what the Jews had actually suffered from the Nazis 
For it was history that as far as the prosecution was concerned stood in the center of the trial It 
is not an individual that is in the dock at this historic trial and not the Nazi regime alone but anti

Semitism throughout history This was the tone set by BenGurion and faithfully followed by Mr 
Hausner who began his opening address which lasted through three sessions with Pharaoh in 
Egypt and Hamans decree to destroy to slay and to cause them to perish He then proceeded 
to quote Ezekiel And when I the Lord passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own 
blood I said unto thee In thy blood live explaining that these words must be understood as the 
imperative that has confronted this nation ever since its first appearance on the stage of history 
It was bad history and cheap rhetoric worse it was clearly at crosspurposes with putting 
Eichmann on trial suggesting that perhaps he was only an innocent executor of some 
mysteriously foreordained destiny or for that matter even of antiSemitism which perhaps was 
necessary to blaze the trail of the bloodstained road traveled by this people to fulfill its destiny 
A few sessions later when Professor Salo W Baron of Columbia University had testified to the 
more recent history of Eastern European Jewry Dr Servatius could no longer resist temptation 
and asked the obvious questions Why did all this bad luck fall upon the Jewish people and 
Dont you think that irrational motives are at the basis of the fate of this people Beyond the 
understanding of a human being Is not there perhaps something like the spirit of history which 
brings history forward    without the influence of men Is not Mr Hausner basically in 
agreement with the school of historical law  an allusion to Hegel  and has he not shown that 
what the leaders do will not always lead to the aim and destination they wanted    Here the 
intention was to destroy the Jewish people and the objective was not reached and a new 
flourishing State came into being The argument of the defense had now come perilously close 
to the newest antiSemitic notion about the Elders of Zion set forth in all seriousness a few 
weeks earlier in the Egyptian National Assembly by Deputy Foreign Minister Hussain Zulficar 
Sabri Hitler was innocent of the slaughter of the Jews he was a victim of the Zionists who had 
compelled him to perpetrate crimes that would eventually enable them to achieve their aim  the 
creation of the State of Israel Except that Dr Servatius following the philosophy of history 
expounded by the prosecutor had put History in the place usually reserved for the Elders of Zion 
Despite the intentions of BenGurion and all the efforts of the prosecution there remained an 
individual in the dock a person of flesh and blood and if BenGurion did not care what verdict is 
delivered against Eichmann it was undeniably the sole task of the Jerusalem court to deliver 
one 
 
 
 
II  The Accused 
 
 
Otto Adolf son of Karl Adolf Eichmann and Maria ne Schefferling caught in a suburb of Buenos 
Aires on the evening of May   flown to Israel nine days later brought to trial in the District 
Court in Jerusalem on April   stood accused on fifteen counts together with others he 
had committed crimes against the Jewish people crimes against humanity and war crimes 
during the whole period of the Nazi regime and especially during the period of the Second World 
War The Nazis and Nazi Collaborators Punishment Law of  under which he was tried 
provides that a person who has committed one of these    offenses    is liable to the death 
penalty To each count Eichmann pleaded Not guilty in the sense of the indictment 
In what sense then did he think he was guilty In the long crossexamination of the accused 
according to him the longest ever known neither the defense nor the prosecution nor finally 
any of the three judges ever bothered to ask him this obvious question His lawyer Robert 
Servatius of Cologne hired by Eichmann and paid by the Israeli government following the 
precedent set at the Nuremberg Trials where all attorneys for the defense were paid by the 
Tribunal of the victorious powers answered the question in a press interview Eichmann feels 
guilty before God not before the law but this answer remained without confirmation from the 
accused himself The defense would apparently have preferred him to plead not guilty on the 
grounds that under the then existing Nazi legal system he had not done anything wrong that 
what he was accused of were not crimes but acts of state over which no other state has 
jurisdiction par in parem imperium non habet that it had been his duty to obey and that in 
Servatius words he had committed acts for which you are decorated if you win and go to the 

gallows if you lose Thus Goebbels had declared in  We will go down in history as the 
greatest statesmen of all times or as their greatest criminals Outside Israel at a meeting of the 
Catholic Academy in Bavaria devoted to what the Rheinischer Merkur called the ticklish 
problem of the possibilities and limits in the coping with historical and political guilt through 
criminal proceedings Servatius went a step farther and declared that the only legitimate 
criminal problem of the Eichmann trial lies in pronouncing judgment against his Israeli captors 
which so far has not been done  a statement incidentally that is somewhat difficult to reconcile 
with his repeated and widely publicized utterances in Israel in which he called the conduct of the 
trial a great spiritual achievement comparing it favorably with the Nuremberg Trials 
Eichmanns own attitude was different First of all the indictment for murder was wrong With the 
killing of Jews I had nothing to do I never killed a Jew or a nonJew for that matter   I never 
killed any human being I never gave an order to kill either a Jew or a nonJew I just did not do 
it or as he was later to qualify this statement It so happened    that I had not once to do it  
for he left no doubt that he would have killed his own father if he had received an order to that 
effect Hence he repeated over and over what he had already stated in the socalled Sassen 
documents the interview that he had given in  in Argentina to the Dutch journalist Sassen a 
former SS man who was also a fugitive from justice and that after Eichmanns capture had 
been published in part by Life in this country and by Der Stern in Germany that he could be 
accused only of aiding and abetting the annihilation of the Jews which he declared in 
Jerusalem to have been one of the greatest crimes in the history of Humanity The defense paid 
no attention to Eichmanns own theory but the prosecution wasted much time in an unsuccessful 
effort to prove that Eichmann had once at least killed with his own hands a Jewish boy in 
Hungary and it spent even more time and more successfully on a note that Franz 
Rademacher the Jewish expert in the German Foreign Office had scribbled on one of the 
documents dealing with Yugoslavia during a telephone conversation which read 
 
Eichmann proposes shooting This turned out to be the only order to kill if that is what it was 
for which there existed even a shred of evidence 
The evidence was more questionable than it appeared to be during the trial at which the judges 
accepted the prosecutors version against Eichmanns categorical denial  a denial that was very 
ineffective since he had forgotten the brief incident a mere eight thousand people which was 
not so striking as Servatius put it The incident took place in the autumn of  six months 
after Germany had occupied the Serbian part of Yugoslavia The Army had been plagued by 
partisan warfare ever since and it was the military authorities who decided to solve two problems 
at a stroke by shooting a hundred Jews and Gypsies as hostages for every dead German soldier 
To be sure neither Jews nor Gypsies were partisans but in the words of the responsible civilian 
officer in the military government a certain Staatsrat Harald Turner the Jews we had in the 
camps anyhow after all they too are Serb nationals and besides they have to disappear 
quoted by Raul Hilberg in The Destruction of the European Jews  The camps had been 
set up by General Franz Bohme military governor of the region and they housed Jewish males 
only Neither General Bohme nor Staatsrat Turner waited for Eichmanns approval before starting 
to shoot Jews and Gypsies by the thousand The trouble began when Bohme without consulting 
the appropriate police and SS authorities decided to deport all his Jews probably in order to 
show that no special troops operating under a different command were required to make Serbia 
judenrein Eichmann was informed since it was a matter of deportation and he refused approval 
because the move would interfere with other plans but it was not Eichmann but Martin Luther of 
the Foreign Office who reminded General Bohme that In other territories meaning Russia other 
military commanders have taken care of considerably greater numbers of Jews without even 
mentioning it In any event if Eichmann actually did propose shooting he told the military only 
that they should go on doing what they had done all along and that the question of hostages was 
entirely in their own competence Obviously this was an Army affair since only males were 
involved The implementation of the Final Solution in Serbia started about six months later when 
women and children were rounded up and disposed of in mobile gas vans During cross
examination Eichmann as usual chose the most complicated and least likely explanation 
Rademacher had needed the support of the Head Office for Reich Security Eichmanns outfit for 
his own stand on the matter in the Foreign Office and therefore had forged the document 

Rademacher himself explained the incident much more reasonably at his own trial before a 
West German court in  The Army was responsible for order in Serbia and had to kill 
rebellious Jews by shooting This sounded more plausible but was a lie for we know  from Nazi 
sources  that the Jews were not rebellious If it was difficult to interpret a remark made over 
the phone as an order it was more difficult to believe that Eichmann had been in a position to 
give orders to the generals of the Army 
Would he then have pleaded guilty if he had been indicted as an accessory to murder Perhaps 
but he would have made important qualifications What he had done was a crime only in 
retrospect and he had always been a lawabiding citizen because Hitlers orders which he had 
certainly executed to the best of his ability had possessed the force of law in the Third Reich 
The defense could have quoted in support of Eichmanns thesis the testimony of one of the best
known experts on constitutional law in the Third Reich Theodor Maunz currently Minister of 
Education and Culture in Bavaria who stated in  in Gestalt and Recht der Polizei The 
command of the Fhrer    is the absolute center of the present legal order Those who today 
told Eichmann that he could have acted differently simply did not know or had forgotten how 
things had been He did not want to be one of those who now pretended that they had always 
been against it whereas in fact they had been very eager to do what they were told to do 
However times change and he like Professor Maunz had arrived at different insights What he 
had done he had done he did not want to deny it rather he proposed to hang myself in public 
as a warning example for all antiSemites on this earth By this he did not mean to say that he 
regretted anything Repentance is for little children Sic 
 
Even under considerable pressure from his lawyer he did not change this position In a 
discussion of Himmlers offer in  to exchange a million Jews for ten thousand trucks and his 
own role in this plan Eichmann was asked Mr Witness in the negotiations with your superiors 
did you express any pity for the Jews and did you say there was room to help them And he 
replied I am here under oath and must speak the truth Not out of mercy did I launch this 
transaction  which would have been fine except that it was not Eichmann who launched it But 
he then continued quite truthfully My reasons I explained this morning and they were as 
follows Himmler had sent his own man to Budapest to deal with matters of Jewish emigration 
Which incidentally had become a flourishing business for enormous amounts of money Jews 
could buy their way out Eichmann however did not mention this It was the fact that here 
matters of emigration were dealt with by a man who did not belong to the Police Force that made 
him indignant because I had to help and to implement deportation and matters of emigration 
on which I considered myself an expert were assigned to a man who was new to the unit    I 
was fed up    I decided that I had to do something to take matters of emigration into my own 
hands 
Throughout the trial Eichmann tried to clarify mostly without success this second point in his 
plea of not guilty in the sense of the indictment The indictment implied not only that he had 
acted on purpose which he did not deny but out of base motives and in full knowledge of the 
criminal nature of his deeds As for the base motives he was perfectly sure that he was not what 
he called an innerer Schweinehund a dirty bastard in the depths of his heart and as for his 
conscience he remembered perfectly well that he would have had a bad conscience only if he 
had not done what he had been ordered to to  to ship millions of men women and children to 
their death with great zeal and the most meticulous care This admittedly was hard to take Half 
a dozen psychiatrists had certified him as normal  More normal at any rate than I am after 
having examined him one of them was said to have exclaimed while another had found that his 
whole psychological outlook his attitude toward his wife and children mother and father 
brothers sisters and friends was not only normal but most desirable  and finally the minister 
who had paid regular visits to him in prison after the Supreme Court had finished hearing his 
appeal reassured everybody by declaring Eichmann to be a man with very positive ideas 
Behind the comedy of the soul experts lay the hard fact that his was obviously no case of moral 
let alone legal insanity Mr Hausners recent revelations in the Saturday Evening Post of things 
he could not bring out at the trial have contradicted the information given informally in 
Jerusalem Eichmann we are now told had been alleged by the psychiatrists to be a man 
obsessed with a dangerous and insatiable urge to kill a perverted sadistic personality In 

which case he would have belonged in an insane asylum Worse his was obviously also no case 
of insane hatred of Jews of fanatical antiSemitism or indoctrination of any kind He personally 
never had anything whatever against Jews on the contrary he had plenty of private reasons for 
not being a Jew hater To be sure there were fanatic antiSemites among his closest friends for 
instance Lszlo Endre State Secretary in Charge of Political Jewish Affairs in Hungary who 
was hanged in Budapest in  but this according to Eichmann was more or less in the spirit 
of some of my best friends are antiSemites 
Alas nobody believed him The prosecutor did not believe him because that was not his job 
Counsel for the defense paid no attention because he unlike Eichmann was to all appearances 
not interested in questions of conscience And the judges did not believe him because they were 
too good and perhaps also too conscious of the very foundations of their profession to admit that 
an average normal person neither feebleminded nor indoctrinated nor cynical could be 
perfectly incapable of telling right from wrong They preferred to conclude from occasional lies 
that he was a liar  and missed the greatest moral and even legal challenge of the whole case 
Their case rested on the assumption that the defendant like all normal persons must have 
been aware of the criminal nature of his acts and Eichmann was indeed normal insofar as he 
was no exception within the Nazi regime However under the conditions of the Third Reich only 
exceptions could be expected to react normally This simple truth of the matter created a 
dilemma for the judges which they could neither resolve nor escape 
 
He was born on March   in Solingen a German town in the Rhineland famous for its 
knives scissors and surgical instruments Fiftyfour years later indulging in his favorite pastime 
of writing his memoirs he described this memorable event as follows Today fifteen years and a 
day after May   I begin to lead my thoughts back to that nineteenth of March of the year 
 when at five oclock in the morning I entered life on earth in the aspect of a human being 
The manuscript has not been released by the Israeli authorities Harry Mulisch succeeded in 
studying this autobiography for half an hour and the GermanJewish weekly Der Aufbau was 
able to publish short excerpts from it According to his religious beliefs which had not changed 
since the Nazi period in Jerusalem Eichmann declared himself to be a Gottglubiger the Nazi 
term for those who had broken with Christianity and he refused to take his oath on the Bible this 
event was to be ascribed to a higher Bearer of Meaning an entity somehow identical with the 
movement of the universe to which human life in itself devoid of higher meaning is subject 
The terminology is quite suggestive To call God a Hheren Sinnestrger meant linguistically to 
give him some place in the military hierarchy since the Nazis had changed the military recipient 
of orders the Befehlsempfnger into a bearer of orders a Befehlstrger indicating as in the 
ancient bearer of ill tidings the burden of responsibility and of importance that weighed 
supposedly upon those who had to execute orders Moreover Eichmann like everyone 
connected with the Final Solution was officially a bearer of secrets a Geheimnistrger as well 
which as far as selfimportance went certainly was nothing to sneeze at But Eichmann not very 
much interested in metaphysics remained singularly silent on any more intimate relationship 
between the Bearer of Meaning and the bearer of orders and proceeded to a consideration of the 
other possible cause of his existence his parents They would hardly have been so overjoyed at 
the arrival of their firstborn had they been able to watch how in the hour of my birth the Norn of 
misfortune to spite the Norn of good fortune was already spinning threads of grief and sorrow 
into my life But a kind impenetrable veil kept my parents from seeing into the future 
The misfortune started soon enough it started in school Eichmanns father first an accountant 
for the Tramways and Electricity Company in Solingen and after  an official of the same 
corporation in Austria in Linz had five children four sons and a daughter of whom only Adolf 
the eldest it seems was unable to finish high school or even to graduate from the vocational 
school for engineering into which he was then put Throughout his life Eichmann deceived 
people about his early misfortunes by hiding behind the more honorable financial misfortunes of 
his father In Israel however during his first sessions with Captain Avner Less the police 
examiner who was to spend approximately  days with him and who produced  typewritten 
pages from  recorder tapes he was in an ebullient mood full of enthusiasm about this unique 
opportunity to pour forth everything    I know and by the same token to advance to the rank 
of the most cooperative defendant ever His enthusiasm was soon dampened though never 

quite extinguished when he was confronted with concrete questions based on irrefutable 
documents The best proof of his initial boundless confidence obviously wasted on Captain Less 
who said to Harry Mulisch I was Mr Eichmanns father confessor was that for the first time in 
his life he admitted his early disasters although he must have been aware of the fact that he thus 
contradicted himself on several important entries in all his official Nazi records 
Well the disasters were ordinary since he had not exactly been the most hardworking pupil  
or one may add the most gifted  his father had taken him first from high school and then from 
vocational school long before graduation Hence the profession that appears on all his official 
documents construction engineer had about as much connection with reality as the statement 
that his birthplace was Palestine and that he was fluent in Hebrew and Yiddish  another outright 
lie Eichmann had loved to tell both to his SS comrades and to his Jewish victims It was in the 
same vein that he had always pretended he had been dismissed from his job as salesman for the 
Vacuum Oil Company in Austria because of membership in the National Socialist Party The 
version he confided to Captain Less was less dramatic though probably not the truth either he 
had been fired because it was a time of unemployment when unmarried employees were the first 
to lose their jobs This explanation which at first seems plausible is not very satisfactory 
because he lost his job in the spring of  when he had been engaged for two full years to 
Veronika or Vera Liebl who later became his wife Why had he not married her before when he 
still had a good job He finally married in March  probably because bachelors in the SS 
as in the Vacuum Oil Company were never sure of their jobs and could not be promoted 
Clearly bragging had always been one of his cardinal vices 
While young Eichmann was doing poorly in school his father left the Tramway and Electricity 
Company and went into business for himself He bought a small mining enterprise and put his 
unpromising youngster to work in it as an ordinary mining laborer but only until he found him a 
job in the sales department of the Obersterreichischen Elektrobau Company where Eichmann 
remained for over two years He was now about twentytwo years old and without any prospects 
for a career the only thing he had learned perhaps was how to sell What then happened was 
what he himself called his first break of which again we have two rather different versions In a 
handwritten biographical record he submitted in  to win a promotion in the SS he described 
it as follows I worked during the years of  to  as a salesman for the Austrian 
Elektrobau Company I left this position of my own free will as the Vacuum Oil Company of 
Vienna offered me the representation for Upper Austria The key word here is offered since 
according to the story he told Captain Less in Israel nobody had offered him anything His own 
mother had died when he was ten years old and his father had married again A cousin of his 
stepmother  a man he called uncle  who was president of the Austrian Automobile Club and 
was married to the daughter of a Jewish businessman in Czechoslovakia had used his 
connection with the general director of the Austrian Vacuum Oil Company a Jewish Mr Weiss to 
obtain for his unfortunate relation a job as traveling salesman Eichmann was properly grateful 
the Jews in his family were among his private reasons for not hating Jews Even in  or 
 when the Final Solution was in full swing he had not forgotten The daughter of this 
marriage halfJewish according to the Nuremberg Laws    came to see me in order to obtain 
my permission for her emigration into Switzerland Of course I granted this request and the 
same uncle came also to see me to ask me to intervene for some Viennese Jewish couple I 
mention this only to show that I myself had no hatred for Jews for my whole education through 
my mother and my father had been strictly Christian my mother because of her Jewish relatives 
held different opinions from those current in SS circles 
He went to considerable lengths to prove his point he had never harbored any ill feelings against 
his victims and what is more he had never made a secret of that fact I explained this to Dr 
Lwenherz head of the Jewish Community in Vienna as I explained it to Dr Kastner vice
president of the Zionist Organization in Budapest I think I told it to everybody each of my men 
knew it they all heard it from me sometime Even in elementary school I had a classmate with 
whom I spent my free time and he came to our house a family in Linz by the name of Sebba 
The last time we met we walked together through the streets of Linz I already with the Party 
emblem of the NSDAP the Nazi Party in my buttonhole and he did not think anything of it 
Had Eichmann been a bit less prim or the police examination which refrained from cross
examination presumably to remain assured of his cooperation less discreet his lack of 

prejudice might have shown itself in still another aspect It seems that in Vienna where he was 
so extraordinarily successful in arranging the forced emigration of Jews he had a Jewish 
mistress an old flame from Linz Rassenschande sexual intercourse with Jews was probably 
the greatest crime a member of the SS could commit and though during the war the raping of 
Jewish girls became a favorite pastime at the front it was by no means common for a Higher SS 
officer to have an affair with a Jewish woman Thus Eichmanns repeated violent denunciations 
of Julius Streicher the insane and obscene editor of Der Strmer and of his pornographic anti
Semitism were perhaps personally motivated and the expression of more than the routine 
contempt an enlightened SS man was supposed to show toward the vulgar passions of lesser 
Party luminaries 
The five and a half years with the Vacuum Oil Company must have been among the happier ones 
in Eichmanns life He made a good living during a time of severe unemployment and he was still 
living with his parents except when he was out on the road The date when this idyll came to an 
end  Pentecost   was among the few he always remembered Actually things had taken a 
turn for the worse somewhat earlier At the end of  he was unexpectedly transferred from 
Linz to Salzburg very much against his inclinations I lost all joy in my work I no longer liked to 
sell to make calls From such sudden losses of Arbeitsfreude Eichmann was to suffer 
throughout his life The worst of them occurred when he was told of the Fhrers order for the 
physical extermination of the Jews in which he was to play such an important role This too 
came unexpectedly he himself had never thought of    such a solution through violence and 
he described his reaction in the same words I now lost everything all joy in my work all 
initiative all interest I was so to speak blown out A similar blowing out must have happened in 
 in Salzburg and from his own account it is clear that he cannot have been very surprised 
when he was fired though one need not believe his saying that he had been very happy about 
his dismissal 
For whatever reasons the year  marked a turning point of his life It was in April of this year 
that he joined the National Socialist Party and entered the SS upon an invitation of Ernst 
Kaltenbrunner a young lawyer in Linz who later became chief of the  Head Office for Reich 
Security the Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA as I shall call it henceforth in one of whose 
six main departments Bureau IV under the command of Heinrich Mller  Eichmann was 
eventually employed as head of section B In court Eichmann gave the impression of a typical 
member of the lower middle classes and this impression was more than borne out by every 
sentence he spoke or wrote while in prison But this was misleading he was rather the dclass 
son of a solid middleclass family and it was indicative of his comedown in social status that 
while his father was a good friend of Kaltenbrunners father who was also a Linz lawyer the 
relationship of the two sons was rather cool Eichmann was unmistakably treated by 
Kaltenbrunner as his social inferior Before Eichmann entered the Party and the SS he had 
proved that he was a joiner and May   the official date of Germanys defeat was 
significant for him mainly because it then dawned upon him that thenceforward he would have to 
live without being a member of something or other I sensed I would have to live a leaderless 
and difficult individual life I would receive no directives from anybody no orders and commands 
would any longer be issued to me no pertinent ordinances would be there to consult  in brief a 
life never known before lay before me When he was a child his parents uninterested in politics 
had enrolled him in the Young Mens Christian Association from which he later went into the 
German youth movement the Wandervogel During his four unsuccessful years in high school 
he had joined the Jungfrontkmpfeverband the youth section of the GermanAustrian 
organzation of war veterans which though violently proGerman and antirepublican was 
tolerated by the Austrian government When Kaltenbrunner suggested that he enter the SS he 
was just on the point of becoming a member of an altogether different outfit the Freemasons 
Lodge Schlaraffia an association of businessmen physicians actors civil servants etc who 
came together to cultivate merriment and gaiety    Each member had to give a lecture from 
time to time whose tenor was to be humor refined humor Kaltenbrunner explained to Eichmann 
that he would have to give up this merry society because as a Nazi he could not be a Freemason 
 a word that at the time was unknown to him The choice between the SS and Schlaraffia the 
name derives from Schlaraffenland the gluttons CloudCuckoo Land of German fairy tales might 
have been hard to make but he was kicked out of Schlaraffia anyhow he had committed a sin 

that even now as he told the story in the Israeli prison made him blush with shame Contrary to 
my upbringing I had tried though I was the youngest to invite my companions to a glass of 
wine 
A leaf in the whirlwind of time he was blown from Schlaraffia the NeverNever Land of tables set 
by magic and roast chickens that flew into your mouth  or more accurately from the company of 
respectable philistines with degrees and assured careers and refined humor whose worst vice 
was probably an irrepressible desire for practical jokes  into the marching columns of the 
ThousandYear Reich which lasted exactly twelve years and three months At any rate he did 
not enter the Party out of conviction nor was he ever convinced by it  whenever he was asked to 
give his reasons he repeated the same embarrassed clichs about the Treaty of Versailles and 
unemployment rather as he pointed out in court it was like being swallowed up by the Party 
against all expectations and without previous decision It happened so quickly and suddenly He 
had no time and less desire to be properly informed he did not even know the Party program he 
never read Mein Kampf Kaltenbrunner had said to him Why not join the SS And he had 
replied Why not That was how it had happened and that was about all there was to it 
Of course that was not all there was to it What Eichmann failed to tell the presiding judge in 
crossexamination was that he had been an ambitious young man who was fed up with his job as 
traveling salesman even before the Vacuum Oil Company was fed up with him From a humdrum 
life without significance and consequence the wind had blown him into History as he understood 
it namely into a Movement that always kept moving and in which somebody like him  already a 
failure in the eyes of his social class of his family and hence in his own eyes as well  could start 
from scratch and still make a career And if he did not always like what he had to do for example 
dispatching people to their death by the trainload instead of forcing them to emigrate if he 
guessed rather early that the whole business would come to a bad end with Germany losing the 
war if all his most cherished plans came to nothing the evacuation of European Jewry to 
Madagascar the establishment of a Jewish territory in the Nisko region of Poland the experiment 
with carefully built defense installations around his Berlin office to repel Russian tanks and if to 
his greatest grief and sorrow he never advanced beyond the grade of SS 
Obersturmbannfhrer a rank equivalent to lieutenant colonel  in short if with the exception of 
the year in Vienna his life was beset with frustrations he never forgot what the alternative would 
have been Not only in Argentina leading the unhappy existence of a refugee but also in the 
courtroom in Jerusalem with his life as good as forfeited he might still have preferred  if 
anybody had asked him  to be hanged as Obersturmbannfhrer aD in retirement rather than 
living out his life quietly and normally as a traveling salesman for the Vacuum Oil Company 
The beginnings of Eichmanns new career were not very promising In the spring of  while 
he was out of a job the Nazi Party and all its affiliates were suspended in Austria because of 
Hitlers rise to power But even without this new calamity a career in the Austrian Party would 
have been out of the question even those who had enlisted in the SS were still working at their 
regular jobs Kaltenbrunner was still a partner in his fathers law firm Eichmann therefore decided 
to go to Germany which was all the more natural because his family had never given up German 
citizenship This fact was of some relevance during the trial Dr Servatius had asked the West 
German government to demand extradition of the accused and failing this to pay the expenses 
of the defense and Bonn refused on the grounds that Eichmann was not a German national 
which was a patent untruth At Passau on the German border he was suddenly a traveling 
salesman again and when he reported to the regional leader he asked him eagerly if he had 
perhaps some connection with the Bavarian Vacuum Oil Company Well this was one of his not 
infrequent relapses from one period of his life into another whenever he was confronted with 
telltale signs of an unregenerate Nazi outlook in his life in Argentina and even in the Jerusalem 
jail he excused himself with There I go again the old song and dance die alte Tour But his 
relapse in Passau was quickly cured he was told that he had better enlist for some military 
training  All right with me I thought to myself why not become a soldier  and he was sent in 
quick succession to two Bavarian SS camps in Lechfeld and in Dachau he had nothing to do 
with the concentration camp there where the Austrian Legion in exile received its training 
Thus he did become an Austrian after a fashion despite his German passport He remained in 
these military camps from August  until September  advanced to the rank of 
Scharfhrer corporal and had plenty of time to reconsider his willingness to embark upon the 

career of a soldier According to his own account there was but one thing in which he 
distinguished himself during these fourteen months and that was punishment drill which he 
performed with great obstinacy in the wrathful spirit of Serves my father right if my hands freeze 
why doesnt he buy me gloves But apart from such rather dubious pleasures to which he owed 
his first promotion he had a terrible time The humdrum of military service that was something I 
couldnt stand day after day always the same over and over again the same Thus bored to 
distraction he heard that the Security Service of the Reichsfhrer SS Himmlers 
Sicherheitsdienst or SD as I shall call it henceforth had jobs open and applied immediately 
 
 
 
III  An Expert on the Jewish Question 
 
 
 
In  when Eichmann applied successfully for a job the SD was a relatively new apparatus 
in the SS founded two years earlier by Heinrich Himmler to serve as the Intelligence service of 
the Party and now headed by Reinhardt Heydrich a former Navy Intelligence officer who was to 
become as Gerald Reitlinger put it the real engineer of the Final Solution The Final Solution 
 Its initial task had been to spy on Party members and thus to give the SS an ascendancy 
over the regular Party apparatus Meanwhile it had taken on some additional duties becoming 
the information and research center for the Secret State Police or Gestapo These were the first 
steps toward the merger of the SS and the police which however was not carried out until 
September  although Himmler held the double post of Reichsfhrer SS and Chief of the 
German Police from  on Eichmann of course could not have known of these future 
developments but he seems to have known nothing either of the nature of the SD when he 
entered it this is quite possible because the operations of the SD had always been top secret 
As far as he was concerned it was all a misunderstanding and at first a great disappointment 
For I thought this was what I had read about in the Mnchener Illustrierten Zeitung when the high 
Party officials drove along there were commando guards with them men standing on the running 
boards of the cars    In short I had mistaken the Security Service of the Reichsfhrer SS for 
the Reich Security Service    and nobody set me right and no one told me anything For I had 
had not the slightest notion of what now was revealed to me The question of whether he was 
telling the truth had a certain bearing on the trial where it had to be decided whether he had 
volunteered for his position or had been drafted into it His misunderstanding if such it was is not 
inexplicable the SS or Schutzstaffeln had originally been established as special units for the 
protection of the Party leaders 
His disappointment however consisted chiefly in that he had to start all over again that he was 
back at the bottom and his only consolation was that there were others who had made the same 
mistake He was put into the Information department where his first job was to file all information 
concerning Freemasonry which in the early Nazi ideological muddle was somehow lumped with 
Judaism Catholicism and Communism and to help in the establishment of a Freemasonry 
museum He now had ample opportunity to learn what this strange word meant that 
Kaltenbrunner had thrown at him in their discussion of Schlaraffia Incidentally an eagerness to 
establish museums commemorating their enemies was very characteristic of the Nazis During 
the war several services competed bitterly for the honor of establishing antiJewish museums 
and libraries We owe to this strange craze the salvage of many great cultural treasures of 
European Jewry The trouble was that things were again very very boring and he was greatly 
relieved when after four or five months of Freemasonry he was put into the brandnew 
department concerned with Jews This was the real beginning of the career which was to end in 
the Jerusalem court 
It was the year  when Germany contrary to the stipulations of the Treaty of Versailles 
introduced general conscription and publicly announced plans for rearmament including the 
building of an air force and a navy It was also the year when Germany having left the League of 
Nations in  prepared neither quietly nor secretly the occupation of the demilitarized zone of 
the Rhineland It was the time of Hitlers peace speeches  Germany needs peace and desires 

peace We recognize Poland as the home of a great and nationally conscious people 
Germany neither intends nor wishes to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria to annex 
Austria or to conclude an Anschluss  and above all it was the year when the Nazi regime won 
general and unhappily genuine recognition in Germany and abroad when Hitler was admired 
everywhere as a great national statesman In Germany itself it was a time of transition Because 
of the enormous rearmament program unemployment had been liquidated the initial resistance 
of the working class was broken and the hostility of the regime which had at first been directed 
primarily against antiFascists  Communists Socialists leftwing intellectuals and Jews in 
prominent positions  had not yet shifted entirely to persecution of the Jews qua Jews 
To be sure one of the first steps taken by the Nazi government back in  had been the 
exclusion of Jews from the Civil Service which in Germany included all teaching positions from 
grammar school to university and most branches of the entertainment industry including radio 
the theater the opera and concerts and in general their removal from public offices But private 
business remained almost untouched until  and even the legal and medical professions 
were only gradually abolished although Jewish students were excluded from most universities 
and were nowhere permitted to graduate Emigration of Jews in these years proceeded in a not 
unduly accelerated and generally orderly fashion and the currency restrictions that made it 
difficult but not impossible for Jews to take their money or at least the greater part of it out of 
the country were the same for nonJews they dated back to the days of the Weimar Republic 
There were a certain number of Einzelaktionen individual actions putting pressure on Jews to sell 
their property at often ridiculously low prices but these usually occurred in small towns and 
indeed could be traced to the spontaneous individual initiative of some enterprising Storm 
Troopers the socalled SA men who except for their officer corps were mostly recruited from 
the lower classes The police it is true never stopped these excesses but the Nazi authorities 
were not too happy about them because they affected the value of real estate all over the 
country The emigrants unless they were political refugees were young people who realized that 
there was no future for them in Germany And since they soon found out that there was hardly 
any future for them in other European countries either some Jewish emigrants actually returned 
during this period When Eichmann was asked how he had reconciled his personal feelings about 
Jews with the outspoken and violent antiSemitism of the Party he had joined he replied with the 
proverb Nothings as hot when you eat it as when its being cooked  a proverb that was then 
on the lips of many Jews as well They lived in a fools paradise in which for a few years even 
Streicher spoke of a legal solution of the Jewish problem It took the organized pogroms of 
November  the socalled Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass when seventyfive hundred 
Jewish shop windows were broken all synagogues went up in flames and twenty thousand 
Jewish men were taken off to concentration camps to expel them from it 
The frequently forgotten point of the matter is that the famous Nuremberg Laws issued in the fall 
of  had failed to do the trick The testimony of three witnesses from Germany highranking 
former officials of the Zionist organization who left Germany shortly before the outbreak of the 
war gave only the barest glimpse into the true state of affairs during the first five years of the 
Nazi regime The Nuremberg Laws had deprived the Jews of their political but not of their civil 
rights they were no longer citizens Reichsbrger but they remained members of the German 
state Staatsangehrige Even if they emigrated they were not automatically stateless Sexual 
intercourse between Jews and Germans and the contraction of mixed marriages were forbidden 
Also no German woman under the age of fortyfive could be employed in a Jewish household Of 
these stipulations only the last was of practical significance the others merely legalized a de 
facto situation Hence the Nuremberg Laws were felt to have stabilized the new situation of Jews 
in the German Reich They had been secondclass citizens to put it mildly since January  
 their almost complete separation from the rest of the population had been achieved in a 
matter of weeks or months  through terror but also through the more than ordinary connivance of 
those around them There was a wall between Gentiles and Jews Dr Benno Cohn of Berlin 
testified I cannot remember speaking to a Christian during all my journeys over Germany Now 
the Jews felt they had received laws of their own and would no longer be outlawed If they kept 
to themselves as they had been forced to do anyhow they would be able to live unmolested In 
the words of the Reichsvertretung of the Jews in Germany the national association of all 
communities and organizations which had been founded in September  on the initiative of 

the Berlin community and was in no way Naziappointed the intention of the Nuremberg Laws 
was to establish a level on which a bearable relationship between the German and the Jewish 
people became possible to which a member of the Berlin community a radical Zionist added 
Life is possible under every law However in complete ignorance of what is permitted and what 
is not one cannot live A useful and respected citizen one can also be as a member of a minority 
in the midst of a great people Hans Lamm fiber die Entwicklung des deutschen Judentums 
 And since Hitler in the Rhm purge in  had broken the power of the SA the Storm 
Troopers in brown shirts who had been almost exclusively responsible for the early pogroms and 
atrocities and since the Jews were blissfully unaware of the growing power of the blackshirted 
SS who ordinarily abstained from what Eichmann contemptuously called the  Strmer 
methods they generally believed that a modus vivendi would be possible they even offered to 
cooperate in the solution of the Jewish question In short when Eichmann entered upon his 
apprenticeship in Jewish affairs on which four years later he was to be the recognized expert 
and when he made his first contacts with Jewish functionaries both Zionists and Assimilationists 
talked in terms of a great Jewish revival a great constructive movement of German Jewry 
and they still quarreled among themselves in ideological terms about the desirability of Jewish 
emigration as though this depended upon their own decisions 
Eichmanns account during the police examination of how he was introduced into the new 
department  distorted of course but not wholly devoid of truth  oddly recalls this fools paradise 
The first thing that happened was that his new boss a certain von Mildenstein who shortly 
thereafter got himself transferred to Albert Speers Organisation Todt where he was in charge of 
highway construction he was what Eichmann pretended to be an engineer by profession 
required him to read Theodor Herzls Der Judenstaat the famous Zionist classic which converted 
Eichmann promptly and forever to Zionism This seems to have been the first serious book he 
ever read and it made a lasting impression on him From then on as he repeated over and over 
he thought of hardly anything but a political solution as opposed to the later physical solution 
the first meaning expulsion and the second extermination and how to get some firm ground 
under the feet of the Jews It may be worth mentioning that as late as  he seems to have 
protested against desecrators of Herzls grave in Vienna and there are reports of his presence in 
civilian clothes at the commemoration of the thirtyfifth anniversary of Herzls death Strangely 
enough he did not talk about these things in Jerusalem where he continuously boasted of his 
good relations with Jewish officials In order to help in this enterprise he began spreading the 
gospel among his SS comrades giving lectures and writing pamphlets He then acquired a 
smattering of Hebrew which enabled him to read haltingly a Yiddish newspaper  not a very 
difficult accomplishment since Yiddish basically an old German dialect written in Hebrew letters 
can be understood by any Germanspeaking person who has mastered a few dozen Hebrew 
words He even read one more book Adolf Bhms History of Zionism during the trial he kept 
confusing it with Herzls Judenstaat and this was perhaps a considerable achievement for a man 
who by his own account had always been utterly reluctant to read anything except newspapers 
and who to the distress of his father had never availed himself of the books in the family library 
Following up Bhm he studied the organizational setup of the Zionist movement with all its 
parties youth groups and different programs This did not yet make him an authority but it was 
enough to earn him an assignment as official spy on the Zionist offices and on their meetings it is 
worth noting that his schooling in Jewish affairs was almost entirely concerned with Zionism 
His first personal contacts with Jewish functionaries all of them wellknown Zionists of long 
standing were thoroughly satisfactory The reason he became so fascinated by the Jewish 
question he explained was his own idealism these Jews unlike the Assimilationists whom he 
always despised and unlike Orthodox Jews who bored him were idealists like him An 
idealist according to Eichmanns notions was not merely a man who believed in an idea or 
someone who did not steal or accept bribes though these qualifications were indispensable An 
idealist was a man who lived for his idea  hence he could not be a businessman  and who was 
prepared to sacrifice for his idea everything and especially everybody When he said in the 
police examination that he would have sent his own father to his death if that had been required 
he did not mean merely to stress the extent to which he was under orders and ready to obey 
them he also meant to show what an idealist he had always been The perfect idealist like 
everybody else had of course his personal feelings and emotions but he would never permit 

them to interfere with his actions if they came into conflict with his idea The greatest idealist 
Eichmann ever encountered among the Jews was Dr Rudolf Kastner with whom he negotiated 
during the Jewish deportations from Hungary and with whom he came to an agreement that he 
Eichmann would permit the illegal departure of a few thousand Jews to Palestine the trains 
were in fact guarded by German police in exchange for quiet and order in the camps from 
which hundreds of thousands were shipped to Auschwitz The few thousand saved by the 
agreement prominent Jews and members of the Zionist youth organizations were in Eichmanns 
words the best biological material Dr Kastner as Eichmann understood it had sacrificed his 
fellowJews to his idea and this was as it should be Judge Benjamin Halevi one of the three 
judges at Eichmanns trial had been in charge of the Kastner trial in Israel at which Kastner had 
to defend himself for his cooperation with Eichmann and other highranking Nazis in Halevis 
opinion Kastner had sold his soul to the devil Now that the devil himself was in the dock he 
turned out to be an idealist and though it may be hard to believe it is quite possible that the 
one who sold his soul had also been an idealist 
Long before all this happened Eichmann was given his first opportunity to apply in practice what 
he had learned during his apprenticeship After the Anschluss the incorporation of Austria into 
the Reich in March  he was sent to Vienna to organize a kind of emigration that had been 
utterly unknown in Germany where up to the fall of  the fiction was maintained that Jews if 
they so desired were permitted but were not forced to leave the country Among the reasons 
German Jews believed in the fiction was the program of the NSDAP formulated in  
which shared with the Weimar Constitution the curious fate of never being officially abolished its 
TwentyFive Points had even been declared unalterable by Hitler Seen in the light of later 
events its antiSemite provisions were harmless indeed Jews could not be fullfledged citizens 
they could not hold Civil Service positions they were to be excluded from the press and all those 
who had acquired German citizenship after August    the date of the outbreak of the First 
World War  were to be denaturalized which meant they were subject to expulsion 
Characteristically the denaturalization was carried out immediately but the wholesale expulsion 
of some fifteen thousand Jews who from one day to the next were shoved across the Polish 
border at Zbaszyn where they were promptly put into camps took place only five years later 
when no one expected it any longer The Party program was never taken seriously by Nazi 
officials they prided themselves on belonging to a movement as distinguished from a party and 
a movement could not be bound by a program Even before the Nazis rise to power these 
TwentyFive Points had been no more than a concession to the party system and to such 
prospective voters as were oldfashioned enough to ask what was the program of the party they 
were going to join Eichmann as we have seen was free of such deplorable habits and when he 
told the Jerusalem court that he had not known Hitlers program he very likely spoke the truth 
The Party program did not matter you knew what you were joining The Jews on the other 
hand were oldfashioned enough to know the TwentyFive Points by heart and to believe in 
them whatever contradicted the legal implementation of the Party program they tended to ascribe 
to temporary revolutionary excesses of undisciplined members or groups 
But what happened in Vienna in March  was altogether different Eichmanns task had been 
defined as forced emigration and the words meant exactly what they said all Jews regardless 
of their desires and regardless of their citizenship were to be forced to emigrate  an act which in 
ordinary language is called expulsion Whenever Eichmann thought back to the twelve years that 
were his life he singled out his year in Vienna as head of the Center for Emigration of Austrian 
Jews as its happiest and most successful period Shortly before he had been promoted to 
officers rank becoming an Untersturmfhrer or lieutenant and he had been commended for his 
comprehensive knowledge of the methods of organization and ideology of the opponent Jewry 
The assignment in Vienna was his first important job his whole career which had progressed 
rather slowly was in the balance He must have been frantic to make good and his success was 
spectacular in eight 
months fortyfive thousand Jews left Austria whereas no more than nineteen thousand left 
Germany in the same period in less than eighteen months Austria was cleansed of close to a 
hundred and fifty thousand people roughly sixty per cent of its Jewish population all of whom left 
the country legally even after the outbreak of the war some sixty thousand Jews could escape 
How did he do it The basic idea that made all this possible was of course not his but almost 

certainly a specific directive by Heydrich who had sent him to Vienna in the first place 
Eichmann was vague on the question of authorship which he claimed however by implication 
the Israeli authorities on the other hand bound as Yad Vashems Bulletin put it to the fantastic 
thesis of the allinclusive responsibility of Adolf Eichmann and the even more fantastic 
supposition that one ie his mind was behind it all helped him considerably in his efforts to 
deck himself in borrowed plumes for which he had in any case a great inclination The idea as 
explained by Heydrich in a conference with Goring on the morning of the Kristallnacht was 
simple and ingenious enough Through the Jewish community we extracted a certain amount of 
money from the rich Jews who wanted to emigrate By paying this amount and an additional sum 
in foreign currency they made it possible for poor Jews to leave The problem was not to make 
the rich Jews leave but to get rid of the Jewish mob And this problem was not solved by 
Eichmann Not until the trial was over was it learned from the Netherlands State Institute for War 
Documentation that Erich Rajakowitsch a brilliant lawyer whom Eichmann according to his own 
testimony employed for the handling of legal questions in the central offices for Jewish 
emigration in Vienna Prague and Berlin had originated the idea of the emigration funds 
Somewhat later in April  Rajakowitsch was sent to Holland by Heydrich in order to 
establish there a central office which was to serve as a model for the solution of the Jewish 
question in all occupied countries in Europe 
Still enough problems remained that could be solved only in the course of the operation and 
there is no doubt that here Eichmann for the first time in his life discovered in himself some 
special qualities There were two things he could do well better than others he could organize 
and he could negotiate immediately upon his arrival he opened negotiations with the 
representatives of the Jewish community whom he had first to liberate from prisons and 
concentration camps since the revolutionary zeal in Austria greatly exceeding the early 
excesses in Germany had resulted in the imprisonment of practically all prominent Jews After 
this experience the Jewish functionaries did not need Eichmann to convince them of the 
desirability of emigration Rather they informed him of the enormous difficulties which lay ahead 
Apart from the financial problem already solved the chief difficulty lay in the number of papers 
every emigrant had to assemble before he could leave the country Each of the papers was valid 
only for a limited time so that the validity of the first had usually expired long before the last could 
be obtained Once Eichmann understood how the whole thing worked or rather did not work he 
took counsel with himself and gave birth to the idea which I thought would do justice to both 
parties He imagined an assembly line at whose beginnings the first document is put and then 
the other papers and at its end the passport would have to come out as the end product This 
could be realized if all the officers concerned  the Ministry of Finance the income tax people the 
police the Jewish community etc  were housed under the same roof and forced to do their work 
on the spot in the presence of the applicant who would no longer have to run from office to office 
and who presumably would also be spared having some humiliating chicaneries practiced on 
him and certain expenses for bribes When everything was ready and the assembly line was 
doing its work smoothly and quickly Eichmann invited the Jewish functionaries from Berlin to 
inspect it They were appalled This is like an automatic factory like a flour mill connected with 
some bakery At one end you put in a Jew who still has some property a factory or a shop or a 
bank account and he goes through the building from counter to counter from office to office and 
comes out at the other end without any money without any rights with only a passport on which 
it says You must leave the country within a fortnight Otherwise you will go to a concentration 
camp  
This of course was essentially the truth about the procedure but it was not the whole truth For 
these Jews could not be left without any money for the simple reason that without it no country 
at this date would have taken them They needed and were given their Vorzeigegeld the 
amount they had to show in order to obtain their visas and to pass the immigration controls of the 
recipient country For this amount they needed foreign currency which the Reich had no 
intention of wasting on its Jews These needs could not be met by Jewish accounts in foreign 
countries which in any event were difficult to get at because they had been illegal for many 
years Eichmann therefore sent Jewish functionaries abroad to solicit funds from the great Jewish 
organizations and these funds were then sold by the Jewish community to the prospective 
emigrants at a considerable profitone dollar for instance was sold for  or  marks when its 

market value was  marks It was chiefly in this way that the community acquired not only the 
money necessary for poor Jews and people without accounts abroad but also the funds it 
needed for its own hugely expanded activities Eichmann did not make possible this deal without 
encountering considerable opposition from the German financial authorities the Ministry and the 
Treasury which after all could not remain unaware of the fact that these transactions amounted 
to a devaluation of the mark 
Bragging was the vice that was Eichmanns undoing It was sheer rodomontade when he told his 
men during the last days of the war I will jump into my grave laughing because the fact that I 
have the death of five million Jews or enemies of the Reich as he always claimed to have said 
on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction He did not jump and if he had anything 
on his conscience it was not murder but as it turned out that he had once slapped the face of 
Dr Josef Lwenherz head of the Vienna Jewish community who later became one of his favorite 
Jews He had apologized in front of his staff at the time but this incident kept bothering him To 
claim the death of five million Jews the approximate total of losses suffered from the combined 
efforts of all Nazi offices and authorities was preposterous as he knew very well but he had kept 
repeating the damning sentence ad nauseam to everyone who would listen even twelve years 
later in Argentina because it gave him an extraordinary sense of elation to think that he was 
exiting from the stage in this way Former Legationsrat Horst Grell a witness for the defense 
who had known Eichmann in Hungary testified that in his opinion Eichmann was boasting That 
must have been obvious to everyone who heard him utter his absurd claim It was sheer 
boasting when he pretended he had invented the ghetto system or had given birth to the idea 
of shipping all European Jews to Madagascar The Theresienstadt ghetto of which Eichmann 
claimed paternity was established years after the ghetto system had been introduced into the 
Eastern occupied territories and setting up a special ghetto for certain privileged categories was 
like the ghetto system the idea of Heydrich The Madagascar plan seems to have been born 
in the bureaus of the German Foreign Office and Eichmanns own contribution to it turned out to 
owe a good deal to his beloved Dr Lwenherz whom he had drafted to put down some basic 
thoughts on how about four million Jews might be transported from Europe after the war  
presumably to Palestine since the Madagascar project was top secret When confronted at the 
trial with the Lwenherz report Eichmann did not deny its authorship it was one of the few 
moments when he appeared genuinely embarrassed What eventually led to his capture was his 
compulsion to talk big  he was fed up with being an anonymous wanderer between the worlds  
and this compulsion must have grown considerably stronger as time passed not only because he 
had nothing to do that he could consider worth doing but also because the postwarera had 
bestowed so much unexpected fame upon him 
But bragging is a common vice and a more specific and also more decisive flaw in Eichmanns 
character was his almost total inability ever to look at anything from the other fellows point of 
view Nowhere was this flaw more conspicuous than in his account of the Vienna episode He 
and his men and the Jews were all pulling together and whenever there were any difficulties 
the Jewish functionaries would come running to him to unburden their hearts to tell him all their 
grief and sorrow and to ask for his help The Jews desired to emigrate and he Eichmann was 
there to help them because it so happened that at the same time the Nazi authorities had 
expressed a desire to see their Reich judenrein The two desires coincided and he Eichmann 
could do justice to both parties At the trial he never gave an inch when it came to this part of 
the story although he agreed that today when times have changed so much the Jews might 
not be too happy to recall this pulling together and he did not want to hurt their feelings 
The German text of the taped police examination conducted from May   to January  
 each page corrected and approved by Eichmann constitutes a veritable gold mine for a 
psychologist  provided he is wise enough to understand that the horrible can be not only 
ludicrous but outright funny Some of the comedy cannot be conveyed in English because it lies 
in Eichmanns heroic fight with the German language which invariably defeats him It is funny 
when he speaks passim of winged words geflgelte Worte a German colloquialism for 
famous quotes from the classics when he means stock phrases Redensarten or slogans 
Schlagworte It was funny when during the crossexamination on the Sassen documents 
conducted in German by the presiding judge he used the phrase kontra geben to give tit for 
tat to indicate that he had resisted Sassens efforts to liven up his stories Judge Landau 

obviously ignorant of the mysteries of card games did not understand and Eichmann could not 
think of any other way to put it Dimly aware of a defect that must have plagued him even in 
school  it amounted to a mild case of aphasia  he apologized saying Officialese Amtssprache 
is my only language But the point here is that officialese became his language because he was 
genuinely incapable of uttering a single sentence that was not a clich Was it these clichs that 
the psychiatrists thought so normal and desirable Are these the positive ideas a clergyman 
hopes for in those to whose souls he ministers Eichmanns best opportunity to show this positive 
side of his character in Jerusalem came when the young police officer in charge of his mental and 
psychological wellbeing handed him Lolita for relaxation After two days Eichmann returned it 
visibly indignant Quite an unwholesome book  Das ist aber ein sehr unerfreuliches Buch  he 
told his guard To be sure the judges were right when they finally told the accused that all he 
had said was empty talk  except that they thought the emptiness was feigned and that the 
accused wished to cover up other thoughts which though hideous were not empty This 
supposition seems refuted by the striking consistency with which Eichmann despite his rather 
bad memory repeated word for word the same stock phrases and selfinvented clichs when he 
did succeed in constructing a sentence of his own he repeated it until it became a clich each 
time he referred to an incident or event of importance to him Whether writing his memoirs in 
Argentina or in Jerusalem whether speaking to the police examiner or to the court what he said 
was always the same expressed in the same words The longer one listened to him the more 
obvious it became that his inability to speak was closely connected with an inability to think 
namely to think from the standpoint of somebody else No communication was possible with him 
not because he lied but because he was surrounded by the most reliable of all safeguards 
against the words and the presence of others and hence against reality as such 
Thus confronted for eight months with the reality of being examined by a Jewish policeman 
Eichmann did not have the slightest hesitation in explaining to him at considerable length and 
repeatedly why he had been unable to attain a higher grade in the SS that this was not his 
fault He had done everything even asked to be sent to active military duty  Off to the front I 
said to myself then the Standartenfhrer colonelcy will come quicker In court on the contrary 
he pretended he had asked to be transferred because he wanted to escape his murderous duties 
He did not insist much on this though and strangely he was not confronted with his utterances 
to Captain Less whom he also told that he had hoped to be nominated for the Einsatzgruppen 
the mobile killing units in the East because when they were formed in March  his office 
was dead  there was no emigration any longer and deportations had not yet been started 
There was finally his greatest ambition  to be promoted to the job of police chief in some 
German town again nothing doing What makes these pages of the examination so funny is that 
all this was told in the tone of someone who was sure of finding normal human sympathy for a 
hardluck story Whatever I prepared and planned everything went wrong my personal affairs 
as well as my yearslong efforts to obtain land and soil for the Jews I dont know everything was 
as if under an evil spell whatever I desired and wanted and planned to do fate prevented it 
somehow I was frustrated in everything no matter what When Captain Less asked his opinion 
on some damning and possibly lying evidence given by a former colonel of the SS he 
exclaimed suddenly stuttering with rage I am very much surprised that this man could ever 
have been an SS Standartenfhrer that surprises me very much indeed It is altogether 
altogether unthinkable I dont know what to say He never said these things in a spirit of 
defiance as though he wanted even now to defend the standards by which he had lived in the 
past The very words SS or career or Himmler whom he always called by his long official 
title Reichsfhrer SS and Chief of the German Police although he by no means admired him 
triggered in him a mechanism that had become completely unalterable The presence of Captain 
Less a Jew from Germany and unlikely in any case to think that members of the SS advanced 
in their careers through the exercise of high moral qualities did not for a moment throw this 
mechanism out of gear 
Now and then the comedy breaks into the horror itself and results in stories presumably true 
enough whose macabre humor easily surpasses that of any Surrealist invention Such was the 
story told by Eichmann during the police examination about the unlucky Kommerzialrat Storfer of 
Vienna one of the representatives of the Jewish community Eichmann had received a telegram 
from Rudolf Hss Commandant of Auschwitz telling him that Storfer had arrived and had 

urgently requested to see Eichmann I said to myself OK this man has always behaved well 
that is worth my while    Ill go there myself and see what is the matter with him And I go to 
Ebner chief of the Gestapo in Vienna and Ebner says  I remember it only vaguely  If only he 
had not been so clumsy he went into hiding and tried to escape something of the sort And the 
police arrested him and sent him to the concentration camp and according to the orders of the 
Reichsfhrer Himmler no one could get out once he was in Nothing could be done neither Dr 
Ebner nor I nor anybody else could do anything about it I went to Auschwitz and asked Hss to 
see Storfer Yes yes Hss said he is in one of the labor gangs With Storfer afterward well it 
was normal and human we had a normal human encounter He told me all his grief and sorrow I 
said Well my dear old friend Ja mein lieber guter Storfer we certainly got it What rotten luck 
And I also said Look I really cannot help you because according to orders from the 
Reichsfhrer nobody can get out I cant get you out Dr Ebner cant get you out I hear you made 
a mistake that you went into hiding or wanted to bolt which after all you did not need to do 
Eichmann meant that Storfer as a Jewish functionary had immunity from deportation I forget 
what his reply to this was And then I asked him how he was And he said yes he wondered if he 
couldnt be let off work it was heavy work And then I said to Hss WorkStorfer wont have to 
work But Hss said Everyone works here So I said OK I said Ill make out a chit to the 
effect that Storfer has to keep the gravel paths in order with a broom there were little gravel 
paths there and that he has the right to sit down with his broom on one of the benches To 
Storfer I said Will that be all right Mr Storfer Will that suit you Whereupon he was very 
pleased and we shook hands and then he was given the broom and sat down on his bench It 
was a great inner joy to me that I could at least see the man with whom I had worked for so many 
long years and that we could speak with each other Six weeks after this normal human 
encounter Storfer was dead  not gassed apparently but shot 
 
Is this a textbook case of bad faith of lying selfdeception combined with outrageous stupidity Or 
is it simply the case of the eternally unrepentant criminal Dostoevski once mentions in his diaries 
that in Siberia among scores of murderers rapists and burglars he never met a single man who 
would admit that he had done wrong who cannot afford to face reality because his crime has 
become part and parcel of it Yet Eichmanns case is different from that of the ordinary criminal 
who can shield himself effectively against the reality of a noncriminal world only within the narrow 
limits of his gang Eichmann needed only to recall the past in order to feel assured that he was 
not lying and that he was not deceiving himself for he and the world he lived in had once been in 
perfect harmony And that German society of eighty million people had been shielded against 
reality and factuality by exactly the same means the same selfdeception lies and stupidity that 
had now become ingrained in Eichmanns mentality These lies changed from year to year and 
they frequently contradicted each other moreover they were not necessarily the same for the 
various branches of the Party hierarchy or the people at large But the practice of self deception 
had become so common almost a moral prerequisite for survival that even now eighteen years 
after the collapse of the Nazi regime when most of the specific content of its lies has been 
forgotten it is sometimes difficult not to believe that mendacity has become an integral part of the 
German national character During the war the lie most effective with the whole of the German 
people was the slogan of the battle of destiny for the German people der Schicksalskampf des 
deutschen Volkes coined either by Hitler or by Goebbels which made selfdeception easier on 
three counts it suggested first that the war was no war second that it was started by destiny 
and not by Germany and third that it was a matter of life and death for the Germans who must 
annihilate their enemies or be annihilated 
Eichmanns astounding willingness in Argentina as well as in Jerusalem to admit his crimes was 
due less to his own criminal capacity for selfdeception than to the aura of systematic mendacity 
that had constituted the general and generally accepted atmosphere of the Third Reich Of 
course he had played a role in the extermination of the Jews of course if he had not transported 
them they would not have been delivered to the butcher 
 
What he asked is there to admit Now he proceeded he would like to find peace with his 
former enemies  a sentiment he shared not only with Himmler who had expressed it during the 
last year of the war or with the Labor Front leader Robert Ley who before he committed suicide 

in Nuremberg had proposed the establishment of a conciliation committee consisting of the 
Nazis responsible for the massacres and the Jewish survivors but also unbelievably with many 
ordinary Germans who were heard to express themselves in exactly the same terms at the end 
of the war This outrageous clich was no longer issued to them from above it was a self
fabricated stock phrase as devoid of reality as those clichs by which the people had lived for 
twelve years and you could almost see what an extraordinary sense of elation it gave to the 
speaker the moment it popped out of his mouth 
Eichmanns mind was filled to the brim with such sentences His memory proved to be quite 
unreliable about what had actually happened in a rare moment of exasperation Judge Landau 
asked the accused What can you remember if you dont remember the discussions at the so
called Wannsee Conference which dealt with the various methods of killing and the answer of 
course was that Eichmann remembered the turning points in his own career rather well but that 
they did not necessarily coincide with the turning points in the story of Jewish extermination or as 
a matter of fact with the turning points in history He always had trouble remembering the exact 
date of the outbreak of the war or of the invasion of Russia But the point of the matter is that he 
had not forgotten a single one of the sentences of his that at one time or another had served to 
give him a sense of elation Hence whenever during the crossexamination the judges tried to 
appeal to his conscience they were met with elation and they were outraged as well as 
disconcerted when they learned that the accused had at his disposal a different elating clich for 
each period of his life and each of his activities In his mind there was no contradiction between 
I will jump into my grave laughing appropriate for the end of the war and I shall gladly hang 
myself in public as a warning example for all antiSemites on this earth which now under vastly 
different circumstances fulfilled exactly the same function of giving him a lift 
These habits of Eichmanns created considerable difficulty during the trial  less for Eichmann 
himself than for those who had come to prosecute him to defend him to judge him and to report 
on him For all this it was essential that one take him seriously and this was very hard to do 
unless one sought the easiest way out of the dilemma between the unspeakable horror of the 
deeds and the undeniable ludicrousness of the man who perpetrated them and declared him a 
clever calculating liar  which he obviously was not His own convictions in this matter were far 
from modest One of the few gifts fate bestowed upon me is a capacity for truth insofar as it 
depends upon myself This gift he had claimed even before the prosecutor wanted to settle on 
him crimes he had not committed In the disorganized rambling notes he made in Argentina in 
preparation for the interview with Sassen when he was still as he even pointed out at the time 
in full possession of my physical and psychological freedom he had issued a fantastic warning 
to future historians to be objective enough not to stray from the path of this truth recorded here  
fantastic because every line of these scribblings shows his utter ignorance of everything that was 
not directly technically and bureaucratically connected with his job and also shows an 
extraordinarily faulty memory 
Despite all the efforts of the prosecution everybody could see that this man was not a monster 
but it was difficult indeed not to suspect that he was a clown And since this suspicion would have 
been fatal to the whole enterprise and was also rather hard to sustain in view of the sufferings he 
and his like had caused to millions of people his worst clowneries were hardly noticed and almost 
never reported What could you do with a man who first declared with great emphasis that the 
one thing he had learned in an illspent life was that one should never take an oath Today no 
man no judge could ever persuade me to make a sworn statement to declare something under 
oath as a witness I refuse it I refuse it for moral reasons Since my experience tells me that if 
one is loyal to his oath one day he has to take the consequences I have made up my mind once 
and for all that no judge in the world or any other authority will ever be capable of making me 
swear an oath to give sworn testimony I wont do it voluntarily and no one will be able to force 
me and then after being told explicitly that if he wished to testify in his own defense he might 
do so under oath or without an oath declared without further ado that he would prefer to testify 
under oath Or who repeatedly and with a great show of feeling assured the court as he had 
assured the police examiner that the worst thing he could do would be to try to escape his true 
responsibilities to fight for his neck to plead for mercy  and then upon instruction of his counsel 
submitted a handwritten document containing his plea for mercy 
As far as Eichmann was concerned these were questions of changing moods and as long as he 

was capable of finding either in his memory or on the spur of the moment an elating stock 
phrase to go with them he was quite content without ever becoming aware of anything like 
inconsistencies As we shall see this horrible gift for consoling himself with clichs did not 
leave him in the hour of his death 
 
 
 
IV  The First Solution Expulsion 
 
 
Had this been an ordinary trial with the normal tug of war between prosecution and defense to 
bring out the facts and do justice to both sides it would be possible to switch now to the version 
of the defense and find out whether there was not more to Eichmanns grotesque account of his 
activities in Vienna than meets the eye and whether his distortions of reality could not really be 
ascribed to more than the mendacity of an individual The facts for which Eichmann was to hang 
had been established beyond reasonable doubt long before the trial started and they were 
generally known to all students of the Nazi regime The additional facts that the prosecution tried 
to establish were it is  true partly accepted in the judgment but they would never have appeared 
to be beyond reasonable doubt if the defense had brought its own evidence to bear upon the 
proceedings Hence no report on the Eichmann case perhaps as distinguished from the 
Eichmann trial could be complete without paying some attention to certain facts that are well 
enough known but that Dr Servatius chose to ignore 
This is especially true of Eichmanns muddled general outlook and ideology with respect to the 
Jewish question During crossexamination he told the presiding judge that in Vienna he 
regarded the Jews as opponents with respect to whom a mutually acceptable a mutually fair 
solution had to be found 
    That solution I envisaged as putting firm soil under their feet so that they would have a place 
of their own soil of their own And I was working in the direction of that solution joyfully I 
cooperated in reaching such a solution gladly and joyfully because it was also the kind of 
solution that was approved by movements among the Jewish people themselves and I regarded 
this as the most appropriate solution to this matter 
 
 
This was the true reason they had all pulled together the reason their work had been based 
upon mutuality It was in the interest of the Jews though perhaps not all Jews understood this to 
get out of the country one had to help them one had to help these functionaries to act and 
thats what I did If the Jewish functionaries were idealists that is Zionists he respected them 
treated them as equals listened to all their requests and complaints and applications for 
support kept his promises as far as he could  People are inclined to forget that now Who 
but he Eichmann had saved hundreds of thousands of Jews What but his great zeal and gifts 
of organization had enabled them to escape in time True he could not foresee at the time the 
coming Final Solution but he had saved them that was a fact In an interview given in this 
country during the trial Eichmanns son told the same story to American reporters It must have 
been a family legend 
In a sense one can understand why counsel for the defense did nothing to back up Eichmanns 
version of his relations with the Zionists Eichmann admitted as he had in the Sassen interview 
that he did not greet his assignment with the apathy of an ox being led to his stall that he had 
been very different from those colleagues who had never read a basic book ie Herzls 
Judenstaat worked through it absorbed it absorbed it with interest and who therefore lacked 
inner rapport with their work They were nothing but office drudges for whom everything was 
decided by paragraphs by orders who were interested in nothing else who were in short 
precisely such small cogs as according to the defense Eichmann himself had been If this 
meant no more than giving unquestioning obedience to the Fhrers orders then they had all 
been small cogs  even Himmler we are told by his masseur Felix Kersten had not greeted the 
Final Solution with great enthusiasm and Eichmann assured the police examiner that his own 
boss Heinrich Mller would never have proposed anything so crude as physical 

extermination Obviously in Eichmanns eyes the smallcog theory was quite beside the point 
Certainly he had not been as big as Mr Hausner tried to make him after all he was not Hitler 
nor for that matter could he compare himself in importance as far as the solution of the Jewish 
question was concerned with Mller or Heydrich or Himmler he was no megalomaniac But 
neither was he as small as the defense wished him to be 
Eichmanns distortions of reality were horrible because of the horrors they dealt with but in 
principle they were not very different from things current in postHitler Germany There is for 
instance FranzJosef Strauss former Minister of Defense who recently conducted an election 
campaign against Willy Brandt now mayor of West Berlin but a refugee in Norway during the 
Hitler period Strauss asked a widely publicized and apparently very successful question of Mr 
Brandt What were you doing those twelve years outside Germany We know what we were 
doing here in Germany  with complete impunity without anybodys batting an eye let alone 
reminding the member of the Bonn government that what Germans in Germany were doing 
during those years has become notorious indeed The same innocence is to be found in a 
recent casual remark by a respected and respectable German literary critic who was probably 
never a Party member reviewing a study of literature in the Third Reich he said that its author 
belonged with those intellectuals who at the outbreak of barbarism deserted us without 
exception This author was of course a Jew and he was expelled by the Nazis and himself 
deserted by Gentiles people like Mr Heinz Beckmann of the Rheinischer Merkur Incidentally 
the very word barbarism today frequently applied by Germans to the Hitler period is a 
distortion of reality it is as though Jewish and nonJewish intellectuals had fled a country that was 
no longer refined enough for them 
Eichmann though much less refined than statesmen and literary critics could on the other hand 
have cited certain indisputable facts to back up his story if his memory had not been so bad or if 
the defense had helped him For it is indisputable that during the first stages of their Jewish 
policy the National Socialists thought it proper to adopt a proZionist attitude Hans Lamm and 
it was during these first stages that Eichmann learned his lessons about Jews He was by no 
means alone in taking this proZionism seriously the German Jews themselves thought it would 
be sufficient to undo assimilation through a new process of dissimilation and flocked into the 
ranks of the Zionist movement There are no reliable statistics on this development but it is 
estimated that the circulation of the Zionist weekly Die Jdische Rundschau increased in the first 
months of the Hitler regime from approximately five to seven thousand to nearly forty thousand 
and it is known that the Zionist fundraising organizations received in  from a greatly 
diminished and impoverished population three times as much as in  This did not 
necessarily mean that the Jews wished to emigrate to Palestine it was more a matter of pride 
Wear it with Pride the Yellow Star the most popular slogan of these years coined by Robert 
Weltsch editorinchief of the Jdische Rundschau expressed the general emotional 
atmosphere The polemical point of the slogan formulated as a response to Boycott Day April  
  more than six years before the Nazis actually forced the Jews to wear a badge a six
pointed yellow star on a white ground  was directed against the assimilationists and all those 
people who refused to be reconciled to the new revolutionary development those who were 
always behind the times die ewig Gestrigen The slogan was recalled at the trial with a good 
deal of emotion by witnesses from Germany They forgot to mention that Robert Weltsch himself 
a highly distinguished journalist had said in recent years that he would never have issued his 
slogan if he had been able to foresee developments 
But quite apart from all slogans and ideological quarrels it was in those years a fact of everyday 
life that only Zionists had any chance of negotiating with the German authorities for the simple 
reason that their chief Jewish adversary the Central Association of German Citizens of Jewish 
Faith to which ninetyfive per cent of organized Jews in Germany then belonged specified in its 
bylaws that its chief task was the fight against antiSemitism it had suddenly become by 
definition an organization hostile to the State and would indeed have been persecuted  which it 
was not  if it had ever dared to do what it was supposed to do During its first few years Hitlers 
rise to power appeared to the Zionists chiefly as the decisive defeat of assimilationism Hence 
the Zionists could for a time at least engage in a certain amount of noncriminal cooperation 
with the Nazi authorities the Zionists too believed that dissimilation combined with the 
emigration to Palestine of Jewish youngsters and they hoped Jewish capitalists could be a 

mutually fair solution At the time many German officials held this opinion and this kind of talk 
seems to have been quite common up to the end A letter from a survivor of Theresienstadt a 
German Jew relates that all leading positions in the Naziappointed Reichsvereinigung were held 
by Zionists whereas the authentically Jewish Reichsvertretung had been composed of both 
Zionists and nonZionists because Zionists according to the Nazis were the decent Jews 
since they too thought in national terms To be sure no prominent Nazi ever spoke publicly in 
this vein from beginning to end Nazi propaganda was fiercely unequivocally uncompromisingly 
antiSemitic and eventually nothing counted but what people who were still without experience in 
the mysteries of totalitarian government dismissed as mere propaganda There existed in those 
first years a mutually highly satisfactory agreement between the Nazi authorities and the Jewish 
Agency for Palestine  a Haavarah or Transfer Agreement which provided that an emigrant to 
Palestine could transfer his money there in German goods and exchange them for pounds upon 
arrival It was soon the only legal way for a Jew to take his money with him the alternative then 
being the establishment of a blocked account which could be liquidated abroad only at a loss of 
between fifty and ninetyfive per cent The result was that in the thirties when American Jewry 
took great pains to organize a boycott of German merchandise Palestine of all places was 
swamped with all kinds of goods made in Germany 
Of greater importance for Eichmann were the emissaries from Palestine who would approach the 
Gestapo and the SS on their own initiative without taking orders from either the German 
Zionists or the Jewish Agency for Palestine They came in order to enlist help for the illegal 
immigration of Jews into Britishruled Palestine and both the Gestapo and the SS were helpful 
They negotiated with Eichmann in Vienna and they reported that he was polite not the 
shouting type and that he even provided them with farms and facilities for setting up vocational 
training camps for prospective immigrants On one occasion he expelled a group of nuns from 
a convent to provide a training farm for young Jews and on another a special train was made 
available and Nazi officials accompanied a group of emigrants ostensibly headed for Zionist 
training farms in Yugoslavia to see them safely across the border According to the story told by 
Jon and David Kimche with the full and generous cooperation of all the chief actors The Secret 
Roads The Illegal Migration of a People  London  these Jews from Palestine 
spoke a language not totally different from that of Eichmann They had been sent to Europe by 
the communal settlements in Palestine and they were not interested in rescue operations That 
was not their job They wanted to select suitable material and their chief enemy prior to the 
extermination program was not those who made life impossible for Jews in the old countries 
Germany or Austria but those who barred access to the new homeland that enemy was 
definitely Britain not Germany Indeed they were in a position to deal with the Nazi authorities on 
a footing amounting to equality which native Jews were not since they enjoyed the protection of 
the mandatory power they were probably among the first Jews to talk openly about mutual 
interests and were certainly the first to be given permission to pick young Jewish pioneers from 
among the Jews in the concentration camps Of course they were unaware of the sinister 
implications of this deal which still lay in the future but they too somehow believed that if it was a 
question of selecting Jews for survival the Jews should do the selecting themselves It was this 
fundamental error in judgment that eventually led to a situation in which the nonselected majority 
of Jews inevitably found themselves confronted with two enemies  the Nazi authorities and the 
Jewish authorities As far as the Viennese episode is concerned Eichmanns preposterous claim 
to have saved hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives which was laughed out of court finds 
strange support in the considered judgment of the Jewish historians the Kimches Thus what 
must have been one of the most paradoxical episodes of the entire period of the Nazi regime 
began the man who was to go down in history as one of the archmurderers of the Jewish people 
entered the lists as an active worker in the rescue of Jews from Europe 
Eichmanns trouble was that he remembered none of the facts that might have supported 
however faintly his incredible story while the learned counsel for the defense probably did not 
even know that there was anything to remember Dr Servatius could have called as witnesses 
for the defense the former agents of Aliyah Beth as the organization for illegal immigration into 
Palestine was called they certainly still remembered Eichmann and they were now living in 
Israel Eichmanns memory functioned only in respect to things that had had a direct bearing 
upon his career Thus he remembered a visit he had received in Berlin from a Palestinian 

functionary who told him about life in the collective settlements and whom he had twice taken out 
to dinner because this visit ended with a formal invitation to Palestine where the Jews would 
show him the country He was delighted no other Nazi official had been able to go to a distant 
foreign land and he received permission to make the trip The judgment concluded that he had 
been sent on an espionage mission which no doubt was true but this did not contradict the 
story Eichmann had told the police Practically nothing came of the enterprise Eichmann 
together with a journalist from his office a certain Herbert Hagen had just enough time to climb 
Mount Carmel in Haifa before the British authorities deported both of them to Egypt and denied 
them entry permits for Palestine according to Eichmann the man from the Haganah  the 
Jewish military organization which became the nucleus of the Israeli Army  came to see them in 
Cairo and what he told them there became the subject of a thoroughly negative report 
Eichmann and Hagen were ordered by their superiors to write for propaganda purposes this was 
duly published 
Apart from such minor triumphs Eichmann remembered only moods and the catch phrases he 
made up to go with them the trip to Egypt had been in  prior to his activity in Vienna and 
from Vienna he remembered no more than the general atmosphere and how elated he had felt 
In view of his astounding virtuosity in never discarding a mood and its catch phrase once and for 
all when they became incompatible with a new era which required different moods and different 
elating phrases  a virtuosity that he demonstrated over and over during the police examination  
one is tempted to believe in his sincerity when he spoke of the time in Vienna as an idyll 
Because of the complete lack of consistency in his thoughts and sentiments this sincerity is not 
even undermined by the fact that his year in Vienna from the spring of  to March  
came at a time when the Nazi regime had abandoned its proZionist attitude It was in the nature 
of the Nazi movement that it kept moving became more radical with each passing month but one 
of the outstanding characteristics of its members was that psychologically they tended to be 
always one step behind the movement  that they had the greatest difficulty in keeping up with it 
or as Hitler used to phrase it that they could not jump over their own shadow 
More damning however than any objective fact was Eichmanns own faulty memory There were 
certain Jews in Vienna whom he recalled very vividly  Dr Lwenherz and Kommerzialrat Storfer 
 but they were not those Palestinian emissaries who might have backed up his story Josef 
Lwenherz who after the war wrote a very interesting memorandum about his negotiations with 
Eichmann one of the few new documents produced by the trial it was shown in part to 
Eichmann who found himself in complete agreement with its main statements was the first 
Jewish functionary actually to organize a whole Jewish community into an institution at the 
service of the Nazi authorities And he was one of the very very few such functionaries to reap a 
reward for his services  he was permitted to stay in Vienna until the end of the war when he 
emigrated to England and the United States he died shortly after Eichmanns capture in  
Storfers fate as we have seen was less fortunate but this certainly was not Eichmanns fault 
Storfer had replaced the Palestinian emissaries who had become too independent and his task 
assigned to him by Eichmann was to organize some illegal transports of Jews into Palestine 
without the help of the Zionists Storfer was no Zionist and had shown no interest in Jewish 
matters prior to the arrival of the Nazis in Austria Still with the help of Eichmann he succeeded in 
getting some thirtyfive hundred Jews out of Europe in  when half of Europe was occupied 
by the Nazis and it seems that he did his best to clear things with the Palestinians That is 
probably what Eichmann had in mind when he added to his story about Storfer in Auschwitz the 
cryptic remark Storfer never betrayed Judaism not with a single word not Storfer A third Jew 
finally whom Eichmann never failed to recall in connection with his prewar activities was Dr Paul 
Eppstein in charge of emigration in Berlin during the last years of the Reichsvereinigung  a Nazi
appointed Jewish central organization not to be confused with the authentically Jewish 
Reichsvertretung which was dissolved in July  Dr Eppstein was appointed by Eichmann to 
serve as Judenltester Jewish Elder in Theresienstadt where he was shot in  
In other words the only Jews Eichmann remembered were those who had been completely in his 
power He had forgotten not only the Palestinian emissaries but also his earlier Berlin 
acquaintances whom he had known well when he was still engaged in intelligence work and had 
no executive powers He never mentioned for instance Dr Franz Meyer a former member of the 
Executive of the Zionist Organization in Germany who came to testify for the prosecution about 

his contacts with the accused from  to  To some extent Dr Meyer confirmed 
Eichmanns own story in Berlin the Jewish functionaries could put forward complaints and 
requests there was a kind of cooperation Sometimes Meyer said we came to ask for 
something and there were times when he demanded something from us Eichmann at that time 
was genuinely listening to us and was sincerely trying to understand the situation his behavior 
was quite correct  he used to address me as Mister and to offer me a seat But in February 
 all this had changed Eichmann had summoned the leaders of German Jewry to Vienna to 
explain to them his new methods of forced emigration And there he was sitting in a large room 
on the ground floor of the Rothschild Palais recognizable of course but completely changed I 
immediately told my friends that I did not know whether I was meeting the same man So terrible 
was the change    Here I met a man who comported himself as a master of life and death He 
received us with insolence and rudeness He did not let us come near his desk We had to remain 
standing Prosecution and judges were in agreement that Eichmann underwent a genuine and 
lasting personality change when he was promoted to a post with executive powers But the trial 
showed that here too he had relapses and that the matter could never have been as simple as 
that There was the witness who testified to an interview with him at Theresienstadt in March 
 when Eichmann again showed himself to be very interested in Zionist matters  the witness 
was a member of a Zionist youth organization and held a certificate of entry for Palestine The 
interview was conducted in very pleasant language and the attitude was kind and respectful 
Strangely counsel for the defense never mentioned this witnesss testimony in his plaidoyer  
Whatever doubts there may be about Eichmanns personality change in Vienna there is no doubt 
that this appointment marked the real beginning of his career Between  and  he won 
four promotions within fourteen months he advanced from Untersturmfhrer to Hauptsturmfhrer 
that is from second lieutenant to captain and in another year and a half he was made 
Obersturmbannfhrer or lieutenant colonel That happened in October  shortly after he 
was assigned the role in the Final Solution that was to land him in the District Court of Jerusalem 
And there to his great grief he got stuck as he saw it there was no higher grade obtainable in 
the section in which he worked But this he could not know during the four years in which he 
climbed quicker and higher than he had ever anticipated In Vienna he had shown his mettle and 
now he was recognized not merely as an expert on the Jewish question the intricacies of 
Jewish organizations and Zionist parties but as an authority on emigration and evacuation as 
the master who knew how to make people move His greatest triumph came shortly after the 
Kristallnacht in November  when German Jews had become frantic in their desire to 
escape Gring probably on the initiative of Heydrich decided to establish in Berlin a Reich 
Center for Jewish Emigration and in the letter containing his directives Eichmanns Viennese 
office was specifically mentioned as the model to be used in the setting up of a central authority 
The head of the Berlin office was not to be Eichmann however but his later greatly admired boss 
Heinrich Mller another of Heydrichs discoveries Heydrich had just taken Mller away from his 
job as a regular Bavarian police officer he was not even a member of the Party and had been an 
opponent until  and called him to the Gestapo in Berlin because he was known to be an 
authority on the Soviet Russian police system For Mller too this was the beginning of his 
career though he had to start with a comparatively small assignment Mller incidentally not 
prone to boasting like Eichmann and known for his sphinxlike conduct succeeded in 
disappearing altogether nobody knows his whereabouts though there are rumors that first East 
Germany and now Albania have engaged the services of the Russianpolice expert 
In March  Hitler moved into Czechoslovakia and erected a German protectorate over 
Bohemia and Moravia Eichmann was immediately appointed to set up another emigration center 
for Jews in Prague In the beginning I was not too happy to leave Vienna for if you have 
installed such an office and if you see everything running smoothly and in goody order you dont 
like to give it up And indeed Prague was somewhat disappointing although the system was the 
same as in Vienna for The functionaries of the Czech Jewish organizations went to Vienna and 
the Viennese people came to Prague so that I did not have to intervene at all The model in 
Vienna was simply copied and carried to Prague Thus the whole thing got started automatically 
But the Prague center was much smaller and I regret to say there were no people of the caliber 
and the energy of a Dr Lwenherz But these as it were personal reasons for discontent were 
minor compared to mounting difficulties of another entirely objective nature Hundreds of 

thousands of Jews had left their homelands in a matter of a few years and millions waited behind 
them for the Polish and Rumanian governments left no doubt in their official proclamations that 
they too wished to be rid of their Jews They could not understand why the world should get 
indignant if they followed in the footsteps of a great and cultured nation This enormous arsenal 
of potential refugees had been revealed during the Evian Conference called in the summer of 
 to solve the problem of German Jewry through intergovernmental action It was a 
resounding fiasco and did great harm to German Jews The avenues for emigration overseas 
now became clogged up just as the escape possibilities within Europe had been exhausted 
earlier and even under the best of circumstances if war had not interfered with his program 
Eichmann would hardly have been able to repeat the Viennese miracle in Prague 
He knew this very well he really had become an expert on matters of emigration and he could 
not have been expected to greet his next appointment with any great enthusiasm War had 
broken out in September  and one month later Eichmann was called back to Berlin to 
succeed Mller as head of the Reich Center for Jewish Emigration A year before this would 
have been a real promotion but now was the wrong moment No one in his senses could 
possibly think any longer of a solution of the Jewish question in terms of forced emigration quite 
apart from the difficulties of getting people from one country to another in wartime the Reich had 
acquired through the conquest of Polish territories two or two and a half million more Jews It is 
true that the Hitler government was still willing to let its Jews go the order that stopped all Jewish 
emigration came only two years later in the fall of  and if any final solution had been 
decided upon nobody had as yet given orders to that effect although Jews were already 
concentrated in ghettos in the East and were also being liquidated by the Einsatzgruppen It was 
only natural that emigration however smartly organized in Berlin in accordance with the 
assembly line principle should peter out by itself  a process Eichmann described as being like 
pulling teeth    listless I would say on both sides On the Jewish side because it was really 
difficult to obtain any emigration possibilities to speak of and on our side because there was no 
bustle and no rush no coming and going of people There we were sitting in a great and mighty 
building amid a yawning emptiness Evidently if Jewish matters his specialty remained a 
matter of emigration he would soon be out of a job 
 
 
 
V  The Second Solution Concentration 
 
 
 
It was not until the outbreak of the war on September   that the Nazi regime became 
openly totalitarian and openly criminal One of the most important steps in this direction from an 
organizational point of view was a decree signed by Himmler that fused the Security Service of 
the SS to which Eichmann had belonged since  and which was a Party organ with the 
regular Security Police of the State in which the Secret State Police or Gestapo was included 
The result of the merger was the Head Office for Reich Security RSHA whose chief was first 
Reinhardt Heydrich after Heydrichs death in  Eichmanns old acquaintance from Linz Dr 
Ernst Kaltenbrunner took over All officials of the police not only of the Gestapo but also of the 
Criminal Police and the Order Police received SS titles corresponding to their previous ranks 
regardless of whether or not they were Party members and this meant that in the space of a day 
a most important part of the old civil services was incorporated into the most radical section of the 
Nazi hierarchy No one as far as I know protested or resigned his job Though Himmler the 
head and founder of the SS had since  been Chief of the German Police as well the two 
apparatuses had remained separate until now The RSHA moreover was only one of twelve 
Head Offices in the SS the most important of which in the present context were the Head 
Office of the Order Police under General Kurt Daluege which was responsible for the rounding 
up of Jews and the Head Office for Administration and Economy the SSWirtschafts
Verwaltungshauptamt or WVHA headed by Oswald Pohl which was in charge of 
concentration camps and was later to be in charge of the economic side of the extermination 
 

This objective attitude  talking about concentration camps in terms of administration and 
about extermination camps in terms of economy  was typical of the SS mentality and 
something Eichmann at the trial was still very proud of By its objectivity Sachlichkeit the 
SS dissociated itself from such emotional types as Streicher that unrealistic fool and also 
from certain TeutonicGermanic Party bigwigs who behaved as though they were clad in horns 
and pelts Eichmann admired Heydrich greatly because he did not like such nonsense at all and 
he was out of sympathy with Himmler because among other things the Reichsfhrer SS and 
Chief of the German Police though boss of all the SS Head Offices had permitted himself at 
least for a long time to be influenced by it During the trial however it was not the accused SS 
Obersturmbannfhrer aD who was to carry off the prize for objectivity it was Dr Servatius a 
tax and business lawyer from Cologne who had never joined the Nazi Party and who 
nevertheless was to teach the court a lesson in what it means not to be emotional that no one 
who heard him is likely to forget The moment one of the few great ones in the whole trial 
occurred during the short oral plaidoyer of the defense after which the court withdrew for four 
months to write its judgment Servatius declared the accused innocent of charges bearing on his 
responsibility for the collection of skeletons sterilizations killings by gas and similar medical 
matters where upon Judge Halevi interrupted him Dr Servatius I assume you made a slip of 
the tongue when you said that killing by gas was a medical matter To which Servatius replied It 
was indeed a medical matter since it was prepared by physicians it was a matter of killing and 
killing too is a medical matter And perhaps to make absolutely sure that the judges in 
Jerusalem would not forget how Germans  ordinary Germans not former members of the SS or 
even of the Nazi Party  even today can regard acts that in other countries are called murder he 
repeated the phrase in his Comments on the Judgment of the First Instance prepared for the 
review of the case before the Supreme Court he said again that not Eichmann but one of his 
men Rolf Gnther was always engaged in medical matters Dr Servatius is well acquainted 
with medical matters in the Third Reich At Nuremberg he defended Dr Karl Brandt Hitlers 
personal physician Plenipotentiary for Hygiene and Health and chief of the euthanasia 
program 
Each of the Head Offices of the SS in its wartime organization was divided into sections and 
subsections and the RSHA eventually contained seven main sections Section IV was the 
bureau of the Gestapo and it was headed by Gruppenfhrer major general Heinrich Mller 
whose rank was the one he had held in the Bavarian police His task was to combat opponents 
hostile to the State of which there were two categories to be dealt with by two sections 
Subsection IVA handled opponents accused of Communism Sabotage Liberalism and 
Assassinations and Subsection IVB dealt with sects that is Catholics Protestants 
Freemasons the post remained vacant and Jews Each of the categories in these subsections 
received an office of its own designated by an arabic numeral so that Eichmann eventually  in 
  was appointed to the desk of IVB in the RSHA Since his immediate superior the 
head of IVB turned out to be a nonentity his real superior was always Mller Mllers superior 
was Heydrich and later Kaltenbrunner each of whom was in his turn under the command of 
Himmler who received his orders directly from Hitler 
In addition to his twelve Head Offices Himmler presided over an altogether different 
organizational setup which also played an enormous role in the execution of the Final Solution 
This was the network of Higher SS and Police Leaders who were in command of the regional 
organizations their chain of command did not link them with the RSHA they were directly 
responsible to Himmler and they always outranked Eichmann and the men at his disposal The 
Einsatzgruppen on the other hand were under the command of Heydrich and the RSHA  
which of course does not mean that Eichmann necessarily had anything to do with them The 
commanders of the Einsatzgruppen also invariably held a higher rank than Eichmann Technically 
and organizationally Eichmanns position was not very high his post turned out to be such an 
important one only because the Jewish question for purely ideological reasons acquired a 
greater importance with every day and week and month of the war until in the years of defeat  
from  on  it had grown to fantastic proportions When that happened his was still the only 
office that officially dealt with nothing but the opponent Jewry but in fact he had lost his 
monopoly because by then all offices and apparatuses State and Party Army and SS were 
busy solving that problem Even if we concentrate our attention only upon the police machinery 

and disregard all the other offices the picture is absurdly complicated since we have to add to 
the Einsatzgruppen and the Higher SS and Police Leader Corps the Commanders and the 
Inspectors of the Security Police and the Security Service Each of these groups belonged in a 
different chain of command that ultimately reached Himmler but they were equal with respect to 
each other and no one belonging to one group owed obedience to a superior officer of another 
group The prosecution it must be admitted was in a most difficult position in finding its way 
through this labyrinth of parallel institutions which it had to do each time it wanted to pin some 
specific responsibility on Eichmann If the trial were to take place today this task would be much 
easier since Raul Hilberg in his The Destruction of the European Jews has succeeded in 
presenting the first clear description of this incredibly complicated machinery of destruction 
Furthermore it must be remembered that all these organs wielding enormous power were in 
fierce competition with one another  which was no help to their victims since their ambition was 
always the same to kill as many Jews as possible This competitive spirit which of course 
inspired in each man a great loyalty to his own outfit has survived the war only now it works in 
reverse it has become each mans desire to exonerate his own outfit at the expense of all the 
others This was the explanation Eichmann gave when he was confronted with the memoirs of 
Rudolf Hss Commander of Auschwitz in which Eichmann is accused of certain things that he 
claimed he never did and was in no position to do He admitted easily enough that Hss had no 
personal reasons for saddling him with acts of which he was innocent since their relations had 
been quite friendly but he insisted in vain that Hss wanted to exculpate his own outfit the 
Head Office for Administration and Economy and to put all the blame on the RSHA Something 
of the same sort happened at Nuremberg where the various accused presented a nauseating 
spectacle by accusing each other  though none of them blamed Hitler Still no one did this 
merely to save his own neck at the expense of somebody elses the men on trial there 
represented altogether different organizations with longstanding deeply ingrained hostility to 
one another Dr Hans Globke whom we met before tried to exonerate his own Ministry of the 
Interior at the expense of the Foreign Office when he testified for the prosecution at Nuremberg 
Eichmann on the other hand always tried to shield Mller Heydrich and Kaltenbrunner 
although the latter had treated him quite badly No doubt one of the chief objective mistakes of 
the prosecution at Jerusalem was that its case relied too heavily on sworn or unsworn affidavits of 
former highranking Nazis dead or alive it did not see and perhaps could not be expected to 
see how dubious these documents were as sources for the establishment of facts Even the 
judgment in its evaluation of the damning testimonies of other Nazi criminals took into account 
that in the words of one of the defense witnesses it was customary at the time of the warcrime 
trials to put as much blame as possible on those who were absent or believed to be dead 
When Eichmann entered his new office in Section IV of the RSHA he was still confronted with 
the uncomfortable dilemma that on the one hand forced emigration was the official formula for 
the solution of the Jewish question and on the other hand emigration was no longer possible 
For the first and almost the last time in his life in the SS he was compelled by circumstances 
to take the initiative to see if he could not give birth to an idea According to the version he gave 
at the police examination he was blessed with three ideas All three of them he had to admit 
came to naught everything he tried on his own invariably went wrong  the final blow came when 
he had to abandon his private fortress in Berlin before he could try it out against Russian tanks 
Nothing but frustration a hard luck story if there ever was one The inexhaustible source of 
trouble as he saw it was that he and his men were never left alone that all these other State and 
Party offices wanted their share in the solution with the result that a veritable army of Jewish 
experts had cropped up everywhere and were falling over themselves in their efforts to be first in 
a field of which they knew nothing For these people Eichmann had the greatest contempt partly 
because they were Johnniescomelately partly because they tried to enrich themselves and 
often succeeded in getting quite rich in the course of their work and partly because they were 
ignorant they had not read the one or two basic books 
His three dreams turned out to have been inspired by the basic books but it was also revealed 
that two of the three were definitely not his ideas at all and with respect to the third  well I do 
not know any longer whether it was Stahlecker his superior in Vienna and Prague or myself who 
gave birth to the idea anyhow the idea was born This last idea was the first chronologically it 
was the idea of Nisko and its failure was for Eichmann the clearest possible proof of the evil of 

interference The guilty person in this case was Hans Frank Governor General of Poland In 
order to understand the plan we must remember that after the conquest of Poland and prior to 
the German attack on Russia the Polish territories were divided between Germany and Russia 
the German part consisted of the Western Regions which were incorporated into the Reich and 
the socalled Eastern Area including Warsaw which was known as the General Government For 
the time being the Eastern Area was treated as occupied territory As the solution of the Jewish 
question at this time was still forced emigration with the goal of making Germany judenrein it 
was natural that Polish Jews in the annexed territories together with the remaining Jews in other 
parts of the Reich should be shoved into the General Government which whatever it may have 
been was not considered to be part of the Reich By December  evacuations eastward had 
started and roughly one million Jewssix hundred thousand from the incorporated area and four 
hundred thousand from the Reich  began to arrive in the General Government 
If Eichmanns version of the Nisko adventure is true  and there is no reason not to believe him  
he or more likely his Prague and Vienna superior Brigadefhrer brigadier general Franz 
Stahlecker must have anticipated these developments by several months This Dr Stahlecker as 
Eichmann was careful to call him was in his opinion a very fine man educated full of reason 
and free of hatred and chauvinism of any kind  in Vienna he used to shake hands with the 
Jewish functionaries A year and a half later in the spring of  this educated gentleman was 
appointed Commander of Einsatzgruppe A and managed to kill by shooting in little more than a 
year he himself was killed in action in  two hundred and fifty thousand Jews  as he 
proudly reported to Himmler himself although the chief of the Einsatzgruppen which were police 
units was the head of the Security Police and the SD that is Reinhardt Heydrich But that came 
later and now in September  while the German Army was still busy occupying the Polish 
territories Eichmann and Dr Stahlecker began to think privately about how the Security Service 
might get its share of influence in the East What they needed was an area as large as possible 
in Poland to be carved off for the erection of an autonomous Jewish state in the form of a 
protectorate    This could be the solution And off they went on their own initiative without 
orders from anybody to reconnoiter They went to the Radom District on the San River not far 
from the Russian border and they saw a huge territory villages market places small towns 
and we said to ourselves that is what we need and why should one not resettle Poles for a 
change since people are being resettled everywhere this will be the solution of the Jewish 
question  firm soil under their feet  at least for some time 
Everything seemed to go very well at first They went to Heydrich and Heydrich agreed and told 
them to go ahead It so happened  though Eichmann in Jerusalem had completely forgotten it  
that their project fitted very well in Heydrichs overall plan at this stage for the solution of the 
Jewish question On September   he had called a meeting of the heads of departments 
of the RSHA and the Einsatzgruppen operating already in Poland at which general directives 
for the immediate future had been given concentration of Jews in ghettos establishment of 
Councils of Jewish Elders and the deportation of all Jews to the General Government area 
Eichmann had attended this meeting setting up the Jewish Center of Emigration  as was 
proved at the trial through the minutes which Bureau  of the Israeli police had discovered in 
the National Archives in Washington Hence Eichmanns or Stahleckers initiative amounted to 
no more than a concrete plan for carrying out Heydrichs directives And now thousands of 
people chiefly from Austria were deported helterskelter into this Godforsaken place which an 
SS officer Erich Rajakowitsch who later was in charge of the deportation of Dutch Jews  
explained to them the Fhrer has promised the Jews as a new homeland There are no 
dwellings there are no houses If you build there will be a roof over your heads There is no 
water the wells all around carry disease there is cholera dysentery and typhoid If you bore and 
find water you will have water As one can see everything looked marvelous except that the 
SS expelled some of the Jews from this paradise driving them across the Russian border and 
others had the good sense to escape of their own volition But then Eichmann complained the 
obstructions began on the part of Hans Frank whom they had forgotten to inform although this 
was his territory Frank complained in Berlin and a great tug of war started Frank wanted to 
solve his Jewish question all by himself He did not want to receive any more Jews in his General 
Government Those who had arrived should disappear immediately And they did disappear 
some were even repatriated which had never happened before and never happened again and 

those who returned to Vienna were registered in the police records as returning from vocational 
training  a curious relapse into the proZionist stage of the movement 
Eichmanns eagerness to acquire some territory for his Jews is best understood in terms of his 
own career The Nisko plan was born during the time of his rapid advancement and it is more 
than likely that he saw himself as the future Governor General like Hans Frank in Poland or the 
future Protector like Heydrich in Czechoslovakia of a Jewish State The utter fiasco of the 
whole enterprise however must have taught him a lesson about the possibilities and the 
desirability of private initiative And since he and Stahlecker had acted within the framework of 
Heydrichs directives and with his explicit consent this unique repatriation of Jews clearly a 
temporary defeat for the police and the SS must also have taught him that the steadily 
increasing power of his own outfit did not amount to omnipotence that the State Ministries and 
the other Party institutions were quite prepared to fight to maintain their own shrinking power 
Eichmanns second attempt at putting firm ground under the feet of the Jews was the 
Madagascar project The plan to evacuate four million Jews from Europe to the French island off 
the southeast coast of Africa  an island with a native population of  and an area of 
 square miles of poor land  had originated in the Foreign Office and was then transmitted 
to the RSHA because in the words of Dr Martin Luther who was in charge of Jewish affairs in 
the Wilhelmstrasse only the police possessed the experiences and the technical facilities to 
execute an evacuation of Jews en masse and to guarantee the supervision of the evacuees The 
Jewish State was to have a police governor under the jurisdiction of Himmler The project itself 
had an odd history Eichmann confusing Madagascar with Uganda always claimed to having 
dreamed a dream once dreamed by the Jewish protagonist of the Jewish State idea Theodor 
Herzl but it is true that his dream had been dreamed before  first by the Polish government 
which in  went to much trouble to look into the idea only to find that it would be quite 
impossible to ship its own nearly three million Jews there without killing them and somewhat 
later by the French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet who had the more modest plan of shipping 
Frances foreign Jews numbering about two hundred thousand to the French colony He even 
consulted his German opposite number Joachim von Ribbentrop on the matter in  
Eichmann at any rate was told in the summer of  when his emigration business had come to 
a complete standstill to work out a detailed plan for the evacuation of four million Jews to 
Madagascar and this project seems to have occupied most of his time until the invasion of 
Russia a year later Four million is a strikingly low figure for making Europe judenrein It 
obviously did not include three million Polish Jews who as everybody knew had been being 
massacred ever since the first days of the war That anybody except Eichmann and some other 
lesser luminaries ever took the whole thing seriously seems unlikely for  apart from the fact that 
the territory was known to be unsuitable not to mention the fact that it was after all a French 
possession  the plan would have required shipping space for four million in the midst of a war 
and at a moment when the British Navy was in control of the Atlantic The Madagascar plan was 
always meant to serve as a cloak under which the preparations for the physical extermination of 
all the Jews of Western Europe could be carried forward no such cloak was needed for the 
extermination of Polish Jews and its great advantage with respect to the army of trained anti
Semites who try as they might always found themselves one step behind the Fhrer was that it 
familiarized all concerned with the preliminary notion that nothing less than complete evacuation 
from Europe would do  no special legislation no dissimilation no ghettos would suffice When 
a year later the Madagascar project was declared to have become obsolete everybody was 
psychologically or rather logically prepared for the next step since there existed no territory to 
which one could evacuate the only solution was extermination  
Not that Eichmann the truthrevealer for generations to come ever suspected the existence of 
such sinister plans What brought the Madagascar enterprise to naught was lack of time and time 
was wasted through the neverending interference from other offices In Jerusalem the police as 
well as the court tried to shake him out of his complacency They confronted him with two 
documents concerning the meeting of September   mentioned above one of them a 
teletyped letter written by Heydrich and containing certain directives to the Einsatzgruppen 
distinguished for the first time between a final aim requiring longer periods of time and to be 
treated as top secret and the stages for achieving this final aim The phrase final solution 
did not yet appear and the document is silent about the meaning of a final aim Hence 

Eichmann could have said all right the final aim was his Madagascar project which at this time 
was being kicked around all the German offices for 
a mass evacuation the concentration of all Jews was a necessary preliminary stage But 
Eichmann after reading the document carefully said immediately that he was convinced that 
final aim could only mean physical extermination and concluded that this basic idea was 
already rooted in the minds of the higher leaders or the men at the very top This might indeed 
have been the truth but then he would have had to admit that the Madagascar project could not 
have been more than a hoax Well he did not he never changed his Madagascar story and 
probably he just could not change it It was as though this story ran along a different tape in his 
memory and it was this taped memory that showed itself to be proof against reason and 
argument and information and insight of any kind 
His memory informed him that there had existed a lull in the activities against Western and 
Central European Jews between the outbreak of the war Hitler in his speech to the Reichstag of 
January   had prophesied that war would bring the annihilation of the Jewish race in 
Europe and the invasion of Russia To be sure even then the various offices in the Reich and in 
the occupied territories were doing their best to eliminate the opponent Jewry but there was no 
unified policy it seemed as though every office had its own solution and might be permitted to 
apply it or to pit it against the solutions of its competitors Eichmanns solution was a police state 
and for that he needed a sizable territory All his efforts failed because of the lack of 
understanding of the minds concerned because of rivalries quarrels squabbling because 
everybody vied for supremacy And then it was too late the war against Russia struck 
suddenly like a thunderclap That was the end of his dreams as it marked the end of the era of 
searching for a solution in the interest of both sides It was also as he recognized in the 
memoirs he wrote in Argentina the end of an era in which there existed laws ordinances 
decrees for the treatment of individual Jews And according to him it was more than that it was 
the end of his career and though this sounded rather crazy in view of his present fame it could 
not be denied that he had a point For his outfit which either in the actuality of forced emigration 
or in the dream of a Naziruled Jewish State had been the final authority in all Jewish matters 
now receded into the second rank so far as the Final Solution of the Jewish question was 
concerned for what was now initiated was transferred to different units and negotiations were 
conducted by another Head Office under the command of the former Reichsfhrer SS and 
Chief of the German Police The different units were the picked groups of killers who operated 
in the rear of the Army in the East and whose special duty consisted of massacring the native 
civilian population and especially the Jews and the other Head Office was the WVHA under 
Oswald Pohl to which Eichmann had to apply to find out the ultimate destination of each 
shipment of Jews This was calculated according to the absorptive capacity of the various killing 
installations and also according to the requests for slave workers from the numerous industrial 
enterprises that had found it profitable to establish branches in the neighborhood of some of the 
death camps Apart from the not very important industrial enterprises of the SS such famous 
German firms as IG Farben the Krupp Werke and SiemensSchuckert Werke had established 
plants in Auschwitz as well as near the Lublin death camps Cooperation between the SS and 
the businessmen was excellent Hss of Auschwitz testified to very cordial social relations with 
the IG Farben representatives As for working conditions the idea was clearly to kill through 
labor according to Hilberg at least twentyfive thousand of the approximately thirtyfive thousand 
Jews who worked for one of the IG Farben plants died As far as Eichmann was concerned the 
point was that evacuation and deportation were no longer the last stages of the solution His 
department had become merely instrumental Hence he had every reason to be very embittered 
and disappointed when the Madagascar project was shelved and the only thing he had to 
console him was his promotion to Obersturmbannfhrer which came in October  
The last time Eichmann recalled having tried something on his own was in September  
three months after the invasion of Russia This was just after Heydrich still chief of the Security 
Police and the Security Service had become Protector of Bohemia and Moravia To celebrate the 
occasion he had called a press conference and had promised that in eight weeks the 
Protectorate would be judenrein After the conference he discussed the matter with those who 
would have to make his word good  with Franz Stahlecker who was then local commander of 
the Security Police in Prague and with the Undersecretary of State Karl Hermann Frank a 

former Sudeten leader who soon after Heydrichs death was to succeed him as Reichsprotektor 
Frank in Eichmanns opinion was a low type a Jewhater of the Streicher kind who didnt 
know a thing about political solutions one of those people who autocratically and let me say in 
the drunkenness of their power simply gave orders and commands But otherwise the 
conference was enjoyable For the first time Heydrich showed a more human side and 
admitted with beautiful frankness that he had allowed his tongue to run away with him  no 
great surprise to those who knew Heydrich an ambitious and impulsive character who often 
let words slip through the fence of his teeth more quickly than he later might have liked So 
Heydrich himself said There is the mess and what are we going to do now Whereupon 
Eichmann said There exists only one possibility if you cannot retreat from your announcement 
Give enough room into which to transfer the Jews of the Protectorate who now live dispersed 
A Jewish homeland a gathering  in of the exiles in the Diaspora And then unfortunately Frank 
 the Jewhater of the Streicher kind  made a concrete proposal and that was that the room be 
provided at Theresienstadt Whereupon Heydrich perhaps also in the drunkenness of his power 
simply ordered the immediate evacuation of the native Czech population from Theresienstadt to 
make room for the Jews 
Eichmann was sent there to look things over Great disappointment the Bohemian fortress town 
on the banks of the Eger was far too small at best it could become a transfer camp for a certain 
percentage of the ninety thousand Jews in Bohemia and Moravia For about fifty thousand 
Czech Jews Theresienstadt indeed became a transfer camp on the way to Auschwitz while an 
estimated twenty thousand more reached the same destination directly We know from better 
sources than Eichmanns faulty memory that Theresienstadt from the beginning was designed 
by Heydrich to serve as a special ghetto for certain privileged categories of Jews chiefly but not 
exclusively from Germany  Jewish functionaries prominent people war veterans with high 
decorations invalids the Jewish partners of mixed marriages and German Jews over sixtyfive 
years of age hence the nickname Altersghetto The town proved too small even for these 
restricted categories and in  about a year after its establishment there began the thinning 
out or loosening up Auflockerung processes by which overcrowding was regularly relieved  
by means of transport to Auschwitz But in one respect Eichmanns memory did not deceive him 
Theresienstadt was in fact the only concentration camp that did not fall under the authority of the 
WVHA but remained his own responsibility to the end Its commanders were men from his own 
staff and always his inferiors in rank it was the only camp in which he had at least some of the 
power which the prosecution in Jerusalem ascribed to him 
Eichmanns memory jumping with great ease over the years  he was two years ahead of the 
sequence of events when he told the police examiner the story of Theresienstadt  was certainly 
not controlled by chronological order but it was not simply erratic It was like a storehouse filled 
with humaninterest stories of the worst type When he thought back to Prague there emerged 
the occasion when he was admitted to the presence of the great Heydrich who showed himself 
to have a more human side A few sessions later he mentioned a trip to Bratislava in Slovakia 
where he happened to be at the time when Heydrich was assassinated What he remembered 
was that he was there as the guest of Sano Mach Minister of the Interior in the German
established Slovakian puppet government In that strongly antiSemitic Catholic government 
Mach represented the German version of antiSemitism he refused to allow exceptions for 
baptized Jews and he was one of the persons chiefly responsible for the wholesale deportation of 
Slovak Jewry Eichmann remembered this because it was unusual for him to receive social 
invitations from members of governments it was an honor Mach as Eichmann recalled was a 
nice easygoing fellow who invited him to bowl with him Did he really have no other business in 
Bratislava in the middle of the war than to go bowling with the Minister of the Interior No 
absolutely no other business he remembered it all very well how they bowled and how drinks 
were served just before the news of the attempt on Heydrichs life arrived Four months and fifty
five tapes later Captain Less the Israeli examiner came back to this point and Eichmann told 
the same story in nearly identical words adding that this day had been unforgettable because 
his superior had been assassinated This time however he was confronted with a document 
that said he had been sent to Bratislava to talk over the current evacuation action against Jews 
from Slovakia He admitted his error at once Clear clear that was an order from Berlin they 
did not send me there to go bowling Had he lied twice with great consistency Hardly To 

evacuate and deport Jews had become routine business what stuck in his mind was bowling 
being the guest of a Minister and hearing of the attack on Heydrich And it was characteristic of 
his kind of memory that he could absolutely not recall the year in which this memorable day fell 
on which the hangman was shot by Czech patriots 
Had his memory served him better he would never have told the Theresienstadt story at all For 
all this happened when the time of political solutions had passed and the era of the physical 
solution had begun It happened when as he was to admit freely and spontaneously in another 
context he had already been informed of the Fhrers order for the Final Solution To make a 
country judenrein at the date when Heydrich promised to do so for Bohemia and Moravia could 
mean only concentration and deportation to points from which Jews could easily be shipped to 
the killing centers That Theresienstadt actually came to serve another purpose that of a 
showplace for the outside world  it was the only ghetto or camp to which representatives of the 
International Red Cross were admitted  was another matter one of which Eichmann at that 
moment was almost certainly ignorant and which anyhow was altogether outside the scope of 
his competence 
 
 
 
V I  The Final Solution Killing 
 
 
On June   Hitler launched his attack on the Soviet Union and six or eight weeks later 
Eichmann was summoned to Heydrichs office in Berlin On July  Heydrich had received a 
letter from Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring CommanderinChief of the Air Force Prime 
Minister of Prussia Pleinipotentiary for the FourYearPlan and last but not least Hitlers Deputy 
in the State as distinguished from the Party hierarchy The letter commissioned Heydrich to 
prepare the general solution Gesamtlosung of the Jewish question within the area of German 
influence in Europe and to submit a general proposal    for the implementation of the desired 
final solution Endlosung of the Jewish question At the time Heydrich received these 
instructions he had already been  as he was to explain to the High Command of the Army in a 
letter dated November    entrusted for years with the task of preparing the final solution of 
the Jewish problem Reitlinger and since the beginning of the war with Russia he had been in 
charge of the mass killings by the Einsatzgruppen in the East 
Heydrich opened his interview with Eichmann with a little speech about emigration which had 
practically ceased though Himmlers formal order prohibiting all Jewish emigration except in 
special cases to be passed upon by him personally was not issued until a few months later and 
then said The Fhrer has ordered the physical extermination of the Jews After which very 
much against his habits he remained silent for a long while as though he wanted to test the 
impact of his words I remember it even today In the first moment I was unable to grasp the 
significance of what he had said because he was so careful in choosing his words and then I 
understood and didnt say anything because there was nothing to say any more For I had never 
thought of such a thing such a solution through violence I now lost everything all joy in my work 
all initiative all interest I was so to speak blown out And then he told me Eichmann you go 
and see Globocnik one of Himmlers Higher SS and Police Leaders in the General Government 
in Lublin the Reichsfhrer Himmler has already given him the necessary orders have a look at 
what he has accomplished in the meantime I think he uses the Russian tank trenches for the 
liquidation of the Jews I still remember that for Ill never forget it no matter how long I live those 
sentences he said during that interview which was already at an end Actually  as Eichmann 
still remembered in Argentina but had forgotten in Jerusalem much to his disadvantage since it 
had bearing on the question of his own authority in the actual killing process  Heydrich had said 
a little more he had told Eichmann that the whole enterprise had been put under the authority of 
the SS Head Office for Economy and Administration  that is not of his own RSHA   and 
also that the official code name for extermination was to be Final Solution 
Eichmann was by no means among the first to be informed of Hitlers intention We have seen 
that Heydrich had been working in this direction for years presumably since the beginning of the 
war and Himmler claimed to have been told and to have protested against this solution 

immediately after the defeat of France in the summer of  By March  about six months 
before Eichmann had his interview with Heydrich it was no secret in higher Party circles that the 
Jews were to be exterminated as Viktor Brack of the Fhrers Chancellery testified at 
Nuremberg But Eichmann as he vainly tried to explain in Jerusalem had never belonged to the 
higher Party circles he had never been told more than he needed to know in order to do a 
specific limited job It is true that he was one of the first men in the lower echelons to be informed 
of this top secret matter which remained top secret even after the news had spread throughout 
all the Party and State offices all business enterprises connected with slave labor and the entire 
officer corps at the very least of the Armed Forces Still the secrecy did have a practical 
purpose Those who were told explicitly of the Fhrers order were no longer mere bearers of 
orders but were advanced to bearers of secrets and a special oath was administered to them 
The members of the Security Service to which Eichmann had belonged since  had in any 
case taken an oath of secrecy 
Furthermore all correspondence referring to the matter was subject to rigid language rules 
and except in the reports from the Einsatzgruppen it is rare to find documents in which such bald 
words as extermination liquidation or killing occur The prescribed code names for killing 
were final solution evacuation Aussiedlung and special treatment Sonderbehandlung 
deportation  unless it involved Jews directed to Theresienstadt the old peoples ghetto for 
privileged Jews in which case it was called change of residence  received the names of 
resettlement Umsiedlung and labor in the East Arbeitseinsatz im Osten the point of these 
latter names being that Jews were indeed often temporarily resettled in ghettos and that a certain 
percentage of them were temporarily used for labor Under special circumstances slight changes 
in the language rules became necessary Thus for instance a high official in the Foreign Office 
once proposed that in all correspondence with the Vatican the killing of Jews be called the 
radical solution this was ingenious because the Catholic puppet government of Slovakia with 
which the Vatican had intervened had not been in the view of the Nazis radical enough in its 
antiJewish legislation having committed the basic error of excluding baptized Jews Only 
among themselves could the bearers of secrets talk in uncoded language and it is very unlikely 
that they did so in the ordinary pursuit of their murderous duties  certainly not in the presence of 
their stenographers and other office personnel For whatever other reasons the language rules 
may have been devised they proved of enormous help in the maintenance of order and sanity in 
the various widely diversified services whose cooperation was essential in this matter Moreover 
the very term language rule Sprachregelung was itself a code name it meant what in ordinary 
language would be called a lie For when a bearer of secrets was sent to meet someone from 
the outside world  as when Eichmann was sent to show the Theresienstadt ghetto to 
International Red Cross representatives from Switzerland  he received together with his orders 
his language rule which in this instance consisted of a lie about a nonexistent typhus epidemic 
in the concentration camp of BergenBelsen which the gentlemen also wished to visit The net 
effect of this language system was not to keep these people ignorant of what they were doing but 
to prevent them from equating it with their old normal knowledge of murder and lies 
Eichmanns great susceptibility to catch words and stock phrases combined with his incapacity 
for ordinary speech made him of course an ideal subject for language rules 
The system however was not a foolproof shield against reality as Eichmann was soon to find 
out He went to Lublin to see Brigadefhrer Odilo Globocnik former Gauleiter of Vienna  though 
not of course despite what the prosecution maintained to convey to him personally the secret 
order for the physical extermination of the Jews which Globocnik certainly knew of before 
Eichmann did  and he used the phrase Final Solution as a kind of password by which to identify 
himself A similar assertion by the prosecution which showed to what degree it had got lost in 
the bureaucratic labyrinth of the Third Reich referred to Rudolf Hss Commander of Auschwitz 
who it believed had also received the Fhrers order through Eichmann This error was at least 
mentioned by the defense as being without corroborative evidence Actually Hss himself 
testified at his own trial that he had received his orders directly from Himmler in June  and 
added that Himmler had told him Eichmann would discuss with him certain details These 
details Hss claimed in his memoirs concerned the use of gas  something Eichmann 
strenuously denied And he was probably right for all other sources contradict Hsss story and 
maintain that written or oral extermination orders in the camps always went through the WVHA 

and were given either by its chief Obergruppenfhrer lieutenant general Oswald Pohl or by 
Brigadefuhrer Richard Glcks who was Hisss direct superior Concerning the doubtful reliability 
of Hsss testimony see also R Pendorf Mrder and Ermordete  And with the use of gas 
Eichmann had nothing whatever to do The details that he went to discuss with Hss at regular 
intervals concerned the killing capacity of the camp  how many shipments per week it could 
absorb  and also perhaps plans for expansion Globocnik when Eichmann arrived at Lublin 
was very obliging and showed him around with a subordinate They came to a road through a 
forest to the right of which there was an ordinary house where workers lived A captain of the 
Order Police perhaps Kriminalkommissar Christian Wirth himself who had been in charge of the 
technical side of the gassing of incurably sick people in Germany under the auspices of the 
Fhrers Chancellery came to greet them led them to a few small wooden bungalows and 
began in a vulgar uneducated harsh voice his explanations how he had everything nicely 
insulated for the engine of a Russian submarine will be set to work and the gases will enter this 
building and the Jews will be poisoned For me too this was monstrous I am not so tough as to 
be able to endure something of this sort without any reaction If today I am shown a gaping 
wound I cant possibly look at it I am that type of person so that very often I was told that I 
couldnt have become a doctor I still remember how I pictured the thing to myself and then I 
became physically weak as though I had lived through some great agitation Such things happen 
to everybody and it left behind a certain inner trembling 
Well he had been lucky for he had still seen only the preparations for the future carbon
monoxide chambers at Treblinka one of the six death camps in the East in which several 
hundred thousand people were to die Shortly after this in the autumn of the same year he was 
sent by his direct superior Muller to inspect the killing center in the Western Regions of Poland 
that had been incorporated into the Reich called the Warthegau The death camp was at Kulm 
or in Polish Chelmno where in  over three hundred thousand Jews from all over Europe 
who had first been resettled in the Lodz ghetto were killed Here things were already in full 
swing but the method was different instead of gas chambers mobile gas vans were used This 
is what Eichmann saw The Jews were in a large room they were told to strip then a truck 
arrived stopping directly before the entrance to the room and the naked Jews were told to enter 
it The doors were closed and the truck started off I cannot tell how many Jews entered I 
hardly looked I could not I could not I had had enough The shrieking and    I was much too 
upset and so on as I later told Muller when I reported to him he did not get much profit out of my 
report I then drove along after the van and then I saw the most horrible sight I had thus far seen 
in my life The truck was making for an open ditch the doors were opened and the corpses were 
thrown out as though they were still alive so smooth were their limbs They were hurled into the 
ditch and I can still see a civilian extracting the teeth with tooth pliers And then I was offjumped 
into my car and did not open my mouth any more After that time I could sit for hours beside my 
driver without exchanging a word with him There I got enough I was finished I only remember 
that a physician in white overalls told me to look through a hole into the truck while they were still 
in it I refused to do that I could not I had to disappear 
Very soon after that he was to see something more horrible This happened when he was sent to 
Minsk in White Russia again by Mller who told him In Minsk they are killing Jews by 
shooting I want you to report on how it is being done So he went and at first it seemed as 
though he would be lucky for by the time he arrived as it happened the affair had almost been 
finished which pleased him very much There were only a few young marksmen who took aim 
at the skulls of dead people in a large ditch Still he saw and that was quite enough for me a 
woman with her arms stretched backward and then my knees went weak and off I went While 
driving back he had the notion of stopping at Lww this seemed a good idea for Lww or 
Lemberg had been an Austrian city and when he arrived there he saw the first friendly picture 
after the horrors That was the railway station built in honor of the sixtieth year of Franz Josefs 
reign  a period Eichmann had always adored since he had heard so many nice things about it 
in his parents home and had also been told how the relatives of his stepmother we are made to 
understand that he meant the Jewish ones had enjoyed a comfortable social status and had 
made good money This sight of the railway station drove away all the horrible thoughts and he 
remembered it down to its last detail  the engraved year of the anniversary for instance But 
then right there in lovely Lww he made a big mistake He went to see the local SS 

commander and told him Well it is horrible what is being done around here I said young 
people are being made into sadists 
 
How can one do that Simply bang away at women and children That is impossible Our people 
will go mad or become insane our own people The trouble was that at Lww they were doing 
the same thing they had been doing in Minsk and his host was delighted to show him the sights 
although Eichmann tried politely to excuse himself Thus he saw another horrible sight A ditch 
had been there which was already filled in And there was gushing from the earth a spring of 
blood like a fountain Such a thing I had never seen before I had had enough of my commission 
and I went back to Berlin and reported to Gruppenfhrer Mller 
This was not yet the end Although Eichmann told him that he was not tough enough for these 
sights that he had never been a soldier had never been to the front had never seen action that 
he could not sleep and had nightmares Mller some nine months later sent him back to the 
Lublin region where the very enthusiastic Globocnik had meanwhile finished his preparations 
Eichmann said that this now was the most horrible thing he had ever seen in his life When he 
first arrived he could not recognize the place with its few wooden bungalows Instead guided by 
the same man with the vulgar voice he came to a railway station with the sign Treblinka on it 
that looked exactly like an ordinary station anywhere in Germany  the same buildings signs 
clocks installations it was a perfect imitation I kept myself back as far as I could I did not draw 
near to see all that Still I saw how a column of naked Jews filed into a large hall to be gassed 
There they were killed as I was told by something called cyanic acid 
The fact is that Eichmann did not see much It is true he repeatedly visited Auschwitz the largest 
and most famous of the death camps but Auschwitz covering an area of eighteen square miles 
in Upper Silesia was by no means only an extermination camp it was a huge enterprise with up 
to a hundred thousand inmates and all kinds of prisoners were held there including nonJews 
and slave laborers who were not subject to gassing It was easy to avoid the killing installations 
and Hss with whom he had a very friendly relationship spared him the gruesome sights He 
never actually attended a mass execution by shooting he never actually watched the gassing 
process or the selection of those fit for work  about twentyfive per cent of each shipment on the 
average  that preceded it at Auschwitz He saw just enough to be fully informed of how the 
destruction machinery worked that there were two different methods of killing shooting and 
gassing that the shooting was done by the Einsatzgruppen and the gassing at the camps either 
in chambers or in mobile vans and in the camps elaborate precautions were taken to fool the 
victims right up to the end 
 
The police tapes from which I have quoted were played in court during the tenth of the trials 
hundred and twentyone sessions on the ninth day of the almost nine months it lasted Nothing 
the accused said in the curiously disembodied voice that came out of the taperecorder  doubly 
disembodied because the body that owned the voice was present but itself also appeared 
strangely disembodied through the thick glass walls surrounding it  was denied either by him or 
by the defense Dr Servatius did not object he only mentioned that later when the defense will 
rise to speak he too would submit to the court some of the evidence given by the accused to 
the police he never did The defense one felt could rise right away for the criminal proceedings 
against the accused in this historic trial seemed complete the case for the prosecution 
established The facts of the case of what Eichmann had done  though not of everything the 
prosecution wished he had done  were never in dispute they had been established long before 
the trial started and had been confessed to by him over and over again There was more than 
enough as he occasionally pointed out to hang him Dont you have enough on me he 
objected when the police examiner tried to ascribe to him powers he never possessed But 
since he had been employed in transportation and not in killing the question remained legally 
formally at least of whether he had known what he was doing and there was the additional 
question of whether he had been in a position to judge the enormity of his deeds  whether he 
was legally responsible apart from the fact that he was medically sane Both questions now were 
answered in the affirmative he had seen the places to which the shipments were directed and he 
had been shocked out of his wits One last question the most disturbing of all was asked by the 
judges and especially by the presiding judge over and over again Had the killing of Jews gone 

against his conscience But this was a moral question and the answer to it may not have been 
legally relevant 
But if the facts of the case were now established two more legal questions arose First could he 
be released from criminal responsibility as Section  of the law under which he was tried 
provided because he had done his acts in order to save himself from the danger of immediate 
death And second could he plead extenuating circumstances as Section  of the same law 
enumerated them had he done his best to reduce the gravity of the consequences of the 
offense or to avert consequences more serious than those which resulted Clearly Sections 
 and  of the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators Punishment Law of  had been drawn up 
with Jewish collaborators in mind Jewish Sonderkommandos special units had everywhere 
been employed in the actual killing process they had committed criminal acts in order to save 
themselves from the danger of immediate death and the Jewish Councils and Elders had 
cooperated because they thought they could avert consequences more serious than those which 
resulted In Eichmanns case his own testimony supplied the answer to both questions and it 
was clearly negative It is true he once said his only alternative would have been suicide but this 
was a lie since we know how surprisingly easy it was for members of the extermination squads to 
quit their jobs without serious consequences for themselves but he did not insist on this point he 
did not mean to be taken literally In the Nuremberg documents not a single case could be traced 
in which an SS member had suffered the death penalty because of a refusal to take part in an 
execution Herbert Jger Betrachtungen zum EichmannProzess in Kriminologie and 
Strafrechtsreform  And in the trial itself there was the testimony of a witness for the 
defense von dem BachZelewski who declared It was possible to evade a commission by an 
application for transfer To be sure in individual cases one had to be prepared for a certain 
disciplinary punishment A danger to ones life however was not at all involved Eichmann knew 
quite well that he was by no means in the classical difficult position of a soldier who may be 
liable to be shot by a courtmartial if he disobeys an order and to be hanged by a judge and jury 
if he obeys it  as Dicey once put it in his famous Law of the Constitution  if only because as a 
member of the SS he had never been subject to a military court but could only have been 
brought before a Police and SS Tribunal In his last statement to the court Eichmann admitted 
that he could have backed out on one pretext or another and that others had done so He had 
always thought such a step was inadmissible and even now did not think it was admirable it 
would have meant no more than a switch to another wellpaying job The postwar notion of open 
disobedience was a fairy tale Under the circumstances such behavior was impossible Nobody 
acted that way It was unthinkable Had he been made commander of a death camp like his 
good friend Hss he would have had to commit suicide since he was incapable of killing Hss 
incidentally had committed a murder in his youth He had assassinated a certain Walter Kadow 
the man who had betrayed Leo Schlageter  a nationalist terrorist in the Rhineland whom the 
Nazis later made into a national hero  to the French Occupation authorities and a German court 
had put him in jail for five years In Auschwitz of course Hss did not have to kill But it was very 
unlikely that Eichmann would have been offered this kind of a job since those who issued the 
orders knew full well the limits to which a person can be driven No he had not been in danger 
of immediate death and since he claimed with great pride that he had always done his duty 
obeyed all orders as his oath demanded he had of course always done his best to aggravate 
the consequences of the offense rather than to reduce them The only extenuating 
circumstance he cited was that he had tried to avoid unnecessary hardships as much as 
possible in carrying out his work and quite apart from the question of whether this was true and 
also apart from the fact that if it was it would hardly have been enough to constitute extenuating 
circumstances in this particular case the claim was not valid because to avoid unnecessary 
hardships was among the standard directives he had been given 
Hence after the taperecorder had addressed the court the death sentence was a foregone 
conclusion even legally except for the possibility that the punishment might be mitigated for acts 
done under superior orders  also provided for in Section  of the Israeli law but this was a very 
remote possibility in view of the enormity of the crime It is important to remember that counsel 
for the defense pleaded not superior orders but acts of state and asked for acquittal on that 
ground  a strategy Dr Servatius had already tried unsuccessfully at Nuremberg where he 
defended Fritz Sauckel Plenipotentiary for Labor Allocation in Grings Office of the FourYear 

Plan who had been responsible for the extermination of tens of thousands of Jewish workers in 
Poland and who was duly hanged in  Acts of state which German jurisprudence even 
more tellingly calls gerichtsfreie or justizlose Hoheitsakte rest on an exercise of sovereign 
power E C S Wade in the British Year Book for International Law  and hence are 
altogether outside the legal realm whereas all orders and commands at least in theory are still 
under judicial control If what Eichmann did had been acts of state then none of his superiors 
least of all Hitler the head of state could be judged by any court The act of state theory agreed 
so well with Dr Servatius general philosophy that it was perhaps not surprising that he should 
have tried it out again what was surprising was that he did not fall back on the argument of 
superior orders as an extenuating circumstance after the judgment had been read and before the 
sentence was pronounced At this point one was perhaps entitled to be glad that this was no 
ordinary trial where statements without bearing on the criminal proceedings must be thrown out 
as irrelevant and immaterial For obviously things were not so simple as the framers of the laws 
had imagined them to be and if it was of small legal relevance it was of great political interest to 
know how long it takes an average person to overcome his innate repugnance toward crime and 
what exactly happens to him once he has reached that point To this question the case of Adolf 
Eichmann supplied an answer that could not have been clearer and more precise 
 
In September  shortly after his first official visits to the killing centers in the East Eichmann 
organized his first mass deportations from Germany and the Protectorate in accordance with a 
wish of Hitler who had told Himmler to make the Reich judenrein as quickly as possible The 
first shipment contained twenty thousand Jews from the Rhineland and five thousand Gypsies 
and in connection with this first transport a strange thing happened Eichmann who never made 
a decision on his own who was extremely careful always to be covered by orders who  as 
freely given testimony from practically all the people who had worked with him confirmed  did not 
even like to volunteer suggestions and always required directives now for the first and last 
time took an initiative contrary to orders instead of sending these people to Russian territory 
Riga or Minsk where they would have immediately been shot by the Einsatzgruppen he directed 
the transport to the ghetto of Ldz where he knew that no preparations for extermination had yet 
been made  if only because the man in charge of the ghetto a certain Regierungsprasident 
Uebelhr had found ways and means of deriving considerable profit from his Jews Ldz in 
fact was the first ghetto to be established and the last to be liquidated those of its inmates who 
did not succumb to disease or starvation survived until the summer of  This decision was to 
get Eichmann into considerable trouble The ghetto was overcrowded and Mr Uebelhr was in 
no mood to receive newcomers and in no position to accommodate them He was angry enough 
to complain to Himmler that Eichmann had deceived him and his men with horsetrading tricks 
learned from the Gypsies Himmler as well as Heydrich protected Eichmann and the incident 
was soon forgiven and forgotten 
Forgotten first of all by Eichmann himself who did not once mention it either in the police 
examination or in his various memoirs When he had taken the stand and was being examined by 
his lawyer who showed him the documents he insisted he had a choice Here for the first and 
last time I had a choice  One was Ldz    If there are difficulties in Ldz these people must 
be sent onward to the East And since I had seen the preparations I was determined to do all I 
could to send these people to Ldz by any means at my disposal Counsel for the defense tried 
to conclude from this incident that Eichmann had saved Jews whenever he could  which was 
patently untrue The prosecutor who crossexamined him later with respect to the same incident 
wished to establish that Eichmann himself had determined the final destination of all shipments 
and hence had decided whether or not a particular transport was to be exterminated  which was 
also untrue Eichmanns own explanation that he had not disobeyed an order but only taken 
advantage of a choice finally was not true either for there had been difficulties in Ldz as he 
knew full well so that his order read in so many words Final destination Minsk or Riga 
Although Eichmann had forgotten all about it this was clearly the only instance in which he 
actually had tried to save Jews Three weeks later however there was a meeting in Prague 
called by Heydrich during which Eichmann stated that the camps used for the detention of 
Russian Communists a category to be liquidated on the spot by the Einsatzgruppen can also 
include Jews and that he had reached an agreement to this effect with the local commanders 

there was also some discussion about the trouble at Lodz and it was finally resolved to send fifty 
thousand Jews from the Reich that is including Austria and Bohemia and Moravia to the 
centers of the Einsatzgruppen operations at Riga and Minsk Thus we are perhaps in a position 
to answer Judge Landaus question  the question uppermost in the minds of nearly everyone 
who followed the trial  of whether the accused had a conscience yes he had a conscience and 
his conscience functioned in the expected way for about four weeks whereupon it began to 
function the other way around 
Even during those weeks when his conscience functioned normally it did its work within rather 
odd limits We must remember that weeks and months before he was informed of the Fhrers 
order Eichmann knew of the murderous activities of the Einsatzgruppen in the East he knew that 
right behind the front lines all Russian functionaries Communists all Polish members of the 
professional classes and all native Jews were being killed in mass shootings Moreover in July 
of the same year a few weeks before he was called to Heydrich he had received a 
memorandum from an SS man stationed in the Warthegau telling him that Jews in the coming 
winter could no longer be fed and submitting for his consideration a proposal as to whether it 
would not be the most humane solution to kill those Jews who were incapable of work through 
some quicker means This at any rate would be more agreeable than to let them die of 
starvation In an accompanying letter addressed to Dear Comrade Eichmann the writer 
admitted that these things sound sometimes fantastic but they are quite feasible The 
admission shows that the much more fantastic order of the Fhrer was not yet known to the 
writer but the letter also shows to what extent this order was in the air Eichmann never 
mentioned this letter and probably had not been in the least shocked by it For this proposal 
concerned only native Jews not Jews from the Reich or any of the Western countries His 
conscience rebelled not at the idea of murder but at the idea of German Jews being murdered I 
never denied that I knew that the Einsatzgruppen had orders to kill but I did not know that Jews 
from the Reich evacuated to the East were subject to the same treatment That is what I did not 
know It was the same with the conscience of a certain Wilhelm Kube an old Party member and 
Generalkommissar in Occupied Russia who was outraged when German Jews with the Iron 
Cross arrived in Minsk for special treatment Since Kube was more articulate than Eichmann 
his words may give us an idea of what went on in Eichmanns head during the time he was 
plagued by his conscience I am certainly tough and I am ready to help solve the Jewish 
question Kube wrote to his superior in December  but people who come from our own 
cultural milieu are certainly something else than the native animalized hordes This sort of 
conscience which if it rebelled at all rebelled at murder of people from our own cultural milieu 
has survived the Hitler regime among Germans today there exists a stubborn misinformation 
to the effect that only Ostjuden Eastern European Jews were massacred 
Nor is this way of thinking that distinguishes between the murder of primitive and of cultured 
people a monopoly of the German people Harry Mulisch relates how in connection with the 
testimony given by Professor Salo W Baron about the cultural and spiritual achievements of the 
Jewish people the following questions suddenly occurred to him Would the death of the Jews 
have been less of an evil if they were a people without a culture such as the Gypsies who were 
also exterminated Is Eichmann on trial as a destroyer of human beings or as an annihilator of 
culture Is a murderer of human beings more guilty when a culture is also destroyed in the 
process And when he put these questions to the Attorney General it turned out He Hausner 
thinks yes I think no How ill we can afford to dismiss this matter bury the troublesome question 
along with the past came to light in the recent film Dr Strangelove where the strange lover of the 
bombcharacterized it is true as a Nazi type  proposes to select in the coming disaster some 
hundred thousand persons to survive in underground shelters And who are to be the happy 
survivors Those with the highest IQ 
This question of conscience so troublesome in Jerusalem had by no means been ignored by the 
Nazi regime On the contrary in view of the fact that the participants in the antiHitler conspiracy 
of July  very rarely mentioned the wholesale massacres in the East in their correspondence 
or in the statements they prepared for use in the event that the attempt on Hitlers life was 
successful one is tempted to conclude that the Nazis greatly overestimated the practical 
importance of the problem We may here disregard the early stages of the German opposition to 
Hitler when it was still antiFascist and entirely a movement of the Left which as a matter of 

principle accorded no significance to moral issues and even less to the persecution of the Jews  
a mere diversion from the class struggle that in the opinion of the Left determined the whole 
political scene Moreover this opposition had all but disappeared during the period in question  
destroyed by the horrible terror of the SA troops in the concentration camps and Gestapo 
cellars unsettled by full employment made possible through rearmament demoralized by the 
Communist Partys tactic of joining the ranks of Hitlers party in order to install itself there as a 
Trojan horse What was left of this opposition at the beginning of the war  some tradeunion 
leaders some intellectuals of the homeless Left who did not and could not know if there was 
anything behind them  gained its importance solely through the conspiracy which finally led to 
the th of July It is of course quite inadmissible to measure the strength of the German 
resistance by the number of those who passed through the concentration camps Before the 
outbreak of the war the inmates belonged in a great number of categories many of which had 
nothing whatsoever to do with resistance of any kind there were the wholly innocent ones such 
as the Jews the asocials such as confirmed criminals and homosexuals Nazis who had been 
found guilty of something or other etc During the war the camps were populated by resistance 
fighters from all over occupied Europe 
Most of the July conspirators were actually former Nazis or had held high office in the Third 
Reich What had sparked their opposition had been not the Jewish question but the fact that 
Hitler was preparing war and the endless conflicts and crises of conscience under which they 
labored hinged almost exclusively on the problem of high treason and the violation of their loyalty 
oath to Hitler Moreover they found themselves on the horns of a dilemma which was indeed 
insoluble in the days of Hitlers successes they felt they could do nothing because the people 
would not understand and in the years of German defeats they feared nothing more than another 
stabintheback legend To the last their greatest concern was how it would be possible to 
prevent chaos and to ward off the danger of civil war And the solution was that the Allies must be 
reasonable and grant a moratorium until order was restored  and with it of course the 
German Armys ability to offer resistance They possessed the most precise knowledge of what 
was going on in the East but there is hardly any doubt that not one of them would have dared 
even to think that the best thing that could have happened to Germany under the circumstances 
would have been open rebellion and civil war The active resistance in Germany came chiefly 
from the Right but in view of the past record of the German Social Democrats it may be doubted 
that the situation would have been very different if the Left had played a larger part among the 
conspirators The question is academic in any case for no organized socialist resistance 
existed in Germany during the war years  as the German historian Gerhard Ritter has rightly 
pointed out 
In actual fact the situation was just as simple as it was hopeless the overwhelming majority of 
the German people believed in Hitler  even after the attack on Russia and the feared war on two 
fronts even after the United States entered the war indeed even after Stalingrad the defection of 
Italy and the landings in France Against this solid majority there stood an indeterminate number 
of isolated individuals who were completely aware of the national and of the moral catastrophe 
they might occasionally know and trust one another there were friendships among them and an 
exchange of opinions but no plan or intention of revolt Finally there was the group of those who 
later became known as the conspirators but they had never been able to come to an agreement 
on anything not even on the question of conspiracy Their leader was Carl Friedrich Goerdeler 
former mayor of Leipzig who had served three years under the Nazis as pricecontroller but had 
resigned rather early in  He advocated the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and 
Wilhelm Leuschner a representative of the Left a former tradeunion leader and Socialist 
assured him of mass support in the Kreisau circle under the influence of Helmuth von Moltke 
there were occasional complaints raised that the rule of law was now trampled under foot but 
the chief concern of this circle was the reconciliation of the two Christian churches and their 
sacred mission in the secular state combined with an outspoken stand in favor of federalism 
On the political bankruptcy of the resistance movement as a whole since  there is a well
documented impartial study the doctoral dissertation of George K Romoser soon to be 
published 
 
As the war went on and defeat became more certain political differences should have mattered 

less and political action become more urgent but Gerhard Ritter seems right here too Without 
the determination of Count Klaus von Stauffenberg the resistance movement would have 
bogged down in more or less helpless inactivity What united these men was that they saw in 
Hitler a swindler a dilettante who sacrificed whole armies against the counsel of his experts 
a madman and a demon the incarnation of all evil which in the German context meant 
something both more and less than when they called him a criminal and a fool which they 
occasionally did But to hold such opinions about Hitler at this late date in no way precluded 
membership in the SS or the Party or the holding of a government post Fritz Hesse hence it 
did not exclude from the circle of the conspirators quite a number of men who themselves were 
deeply implicated in the crimes of the regime  as for instance Count Helldorf then Police 
Commissioner of Berlin who would have become Chief of the German Police if the coup detat 
had been successful according to one of Goerdelers lists of prospective ministers or Arthur 
Nebe of the RSHA former commander of one of the mobile killing units in the East In the 
summer of  when the Himmlerdirected extermination program had reached its climax 
Goerdeler was considering Himmler and Goebbels as potential allies since these two men have 
realized that they are lost with Hitler Himmler indeed became a potential ally  though 
Goebbels did not  and was fully informed of their plans he acted against the conspirators only 
after their failure I am quoting from the draft of a letter by Goerdeler to Field Marshal von Kluge 
but these strange alliances cannot be explained away by tactical considerations necessary vis
vis the Army commanders for it was on the contrary Kluge and Rommel who had given 
special orders that those two monsters Himmler and Goring should be liquidated Ritter  quite 
apart from the fact that Goerdelers biographer Ritter insists that the above  quoted letter 
represents the most passionate expression of his hatred against the Hitler regime 
No doubt these men who opposed Hitler however belatedly paid with their lives and suffered a 
most terrible death the courage of many of them was admirable but it was not inspired by moral 
indignation or by what they knew other people had been made to suffer they were motivated 
almost exclusively by their conviction of the coming defeat and ruin of Germany This is not to 
deny that some of them such as Count York von Wartenburg may have been roused to political 
opposition initially by the revolting agitation against the Jews in November  Ritter But 
that was the month when the synagogues went up in flames and the whole population seemed in 
the grip of some fear houses of God had been set on fire and believers as well as the 
superstitious feared the vengeance of God To be sure the higher officer corps was disturbed 
when Hitlers socalled commissar order was issued in May  and they learned that in the 
coming campaign against Russia all Soviet functionaries and naturally all Jews were simply to be 
massacred In these circles there was of course some concern about the fact that as Goerdeler 
said in the occupied areas and against the Jews techniques of liquidating human beings and of 
religious persecution are practiced    which will always rest as a heavy burden on our history 
But it seems never to have occurred to them that this signified something more and more 
dreadful than that it will make our position negotiating a peace treaty with the Allies 
enormously difficult that it was a blot on Germanys good name and was undermining the 
morale of the Army What on earth have they made of the proud army of the Wars of Liberation 
against Napoleon in  and of Wilhelm I in the FrancoPrussian War of  Goerdeler 
cried when he heard the report of an SS man who nonchalantly related that it wasnt exactly 
pretty to spray with machinegun fire ditches crammed with thousands of Jews and then to throw 
earth on the bodies that were still twitching  Nor did it occur to them that these atrocities might 
be somehow connected with the Allies demand for unconditional surrender which they felt free 
to criticize as both nationalistic and unreasonable inspired by blind hatred In  when the 
eventual defeat of Germany was almost a certainty and indeed even later they still believed that 
they had a right to negotiate with their enemies as equals for a just peace although they knew 
only too well what an unjust and totally unprovoked war Hitler had started Even more startling 
are their criteria for a just peace Goerdeler stated them again and again in numerous 
memoranda the reestablishment of the national borders of  which meant the annexation 
of AlsaceLorraine with the addition of Austria and the Sudetenland furthermore a leading 
position for Germany on the Continent and perhaps the regaining of South Tyrol 
We also know from statements they prepared how they intended to present their case to the 
people There is for instance a draft proclamation to the Army by General Ludwig Beck who was 

to become chief of state in which he talks at length about the obstinacy the incompetence and 
lack of moderation of the Hitler regime its arrogance and vanity But the crucial point the 
most unscrupulous act of the regime was that the Nazis wanted to hold the leaders of the 
armed forces responsible for the calamities of the coming defeat to which Beck added that 
crimes had been committed which are a blot on the honor of the German nation and a defilement 
of the good reputation it had gained in the eyes of the world And what would be the next step 
after Hitler had been liquidated The German Army would go on fighting until an honorable 
conclusion of the war has been assured  which meant the annexation of AlsaceLorraine 
Austria and the Sudetenland There is indeed every reason to agree with the bitter judgment on 
these men by the German novelist Friedrich P ReckMalleczewen who was killed in a 
concentration camp on the eve of the collapse and did not participate in the antiHitler conspiracy 
In his almost totally unknown Diary of a Man in Despair Tagebuch eines Verzweifelten  
ReckMalleczewen wrote after he had heard of the failure of the attempt on Hitlers life which of 
course he regretted A little late gentlemen you who made this archdestroyer of Germany and 
ran after him as long as everything seemed to be going well you who    without hesitation 
swore every oath demanded of you and reduced yourselves to the despicable flunkies of this 
criminal who is guilty of the murder of hundreds of thousands burdened with the lamentations 
and the curse of the whole world now you have betrayed him    Now when the bankruptcy can 
no longer be concealed they betray the house that went broke in order to establish a political 
alibi for themselves  the same men who have betrayed everything that was in the way of their 
claim to power 
There is no evidence and no likelihood that Eichmann ever came into personal contact with the 
men of July  and we know that even in Argentina he still considered them all to have been 
traitors and scoundrels Had he ever had the opportunity though to become acquainted with 
Goerdelers original ideas on the Jewish question he might have discovered some points of 
agreement To be sure Goerdeler proposed to pay indemnity to German Jews for their losses 
and mistreatment   this in  at a time when it was not only a matter of German Jews and 
when these were not just being mistreated and robbed but gassed but in addition to such 
technicalities he had something more constructive in mind namely a permanent solution that 
would save all European Jews from their unseemly position as a more or less undesirable 
guest nation in Europe In Eichmanns jargon this was called giving them some firm ground 
under their feet For this purpose Goerdeler claimed an independent state in a colonial 
country  Canada or South America  a sort of Madagascar of which he certainly had heard Still 
he made some concessions not all Jews would be expelled Quite in line with the early stages of 
the Nazi regime and the privileged categories which were then current he was prepared not to 
deny German citizenship to those Jews who could produce evidence of special military sacrifice 
for Germany or who belonged to families with longestablished traditions Well whatever 
Goerdelers permanent solution of the Jewish question might have meant it was not exactly 
original  as Professor Ritter even in  full of admiration for his hero called it  and 
Goerdeler would have been able to find plenty of potential allies for this part of his program too 
within the ranks of the Party and even the SS 
In the letter to Field Marshal von Kluge quoted above Goerdeler once appealed to Kluges voice 
of conscience But all he meant was that even a general must understand that to continue the 
war with no chance for victory was an obvious crime From the accumulated evidence one can 
only conclude that conscience as such had apparently got lost in Germany and this to a point 
where people hardly remembered it and had ceased to realize that the surprising new set of 
German values was not shared by the outside world This to be sure is not the entire truth For 
there were individuals in Germany who from the very beginning of the regime and without ever 
wavering were opposed to Hitler no one knows how many there were of them  perhaps a 
hundred thousand perhaps many more perhaps many fewer  for their voices were never heard 
They could be found everywhere in all strata of society among the simple people as well as 
among the educated in all parties perhaps even in the ranks of the NSDAP Very few of them 
were known publicly as were the aforementioned ReckMalleczewen or the philosopher Karl 
Jaspers Some of them were truly and deeply pious like an artisan of whom I know who 
preferred having his independent existence destroyed and becoming a simple worker in a factory 
to taking upon himself the little formality of entering the Nazi Party A few still took an oath 

seriously and preferred for example to renounce an academic career rather than swear by 
Hitlers name A more numerous group were the workers especially in Berlin and Socialist 
intellectuals who tried to aid the Jews they knew There were finally the two peasant boys whose 
story is related in Gnther Weisenborns Der lautlose Aufstand  who were drafted into the 
SS at the end of the war and refused to sign they were sentenced to death and on the day of 
their execution they wrote in their last letter to their families We two would rather die than 
burden our conscience with such terrible things We know what the SS must carry out The 
position of these people who practically speaking did nothing was altogether different from that 
of the conspirators Their ability to tell right from wrong had remained intact and they never 
suffered a crisis of conscience There may also have been such persons among the members 
of the resistance but they were hardly more numerous in the ranks of the conspirators than 
among the people at large They were neither heroes nor saints and they remained completely 
silent Only on one occasion in a single desperate gesture did this wholly isolated and mute 
element manifest itself publicly this was when the Scholls two students at Munich University 
brother and sister under the influence of their teacher Kurt Huber distributed the famous leaflets 
in which Hitler was finally called what he was  a mass murderer 
If however one examines the documents and prepared statements of the socalled other 
Germany that would have succeeded Hitler had the July  conspiracy succeeded one can only 
marvel at how great a gulf separated even them from the rest of the world How else can one 
explain the illusions of Goerdeler in particular or the fact that Himmler of all people but also 
Ribbentrop should have started dreaming during the last months of the war of a magnificent 
new role as negotiators with the Allies for a defeated Germany And if Ribbentrop certainly was 
simply stupid Himmler whatever else he might have been was no fool 
 
The member of the Nazi hierarchy most gifted at solving problems of conscience was Himmler 
He coined slogans like the famous watchword of the SS taken from a Hitler speech before the 
SS in  My Honor is my Loyalty  catch phrases which Eichmann called winged words 
and the judges empty talk  and issued them as Eichmann recalled around the turn of the 
year presumably along with a Christmas bonus Eichmann remembered only one of them and 
kept repeating it These are battles which future generations will not have to fight again alluding 
to the battles against women children old people and other useless mouths Other such 
phrases taken from speeches Himmler made to the commanders of the Einsatzgruppen and the 
Higher SS and Police Leaders were To have stuck it out and apart from exceptions caused 
by human weakness to have remained decent that is what has made us hard This is a page of 
glory in our history which has never been written and is never to be written Or The order to 
solve the Jewish question this was the most frightening order an organization could ever 
receive Or We realize that what we are expecting from you is superhuman to be 
superhumanly inhuman All one can say is that their expectations were not disappointed It is 
noteworthy however that Himmler hardly ever attempted to justify in ideological terms and if he 
did it was apparently quickly forgotten What stuck in the minds of these men who had become 
murderers was simply the notion of being involved in something historic grandiose unique a 
great task that occurs once in two thousand years which must therefore be difficult to bear This 
was important because the murderers were not sadists or killers by nature on the contrary a 
systematic effort was made to weed out all those who derived physical pleasure from what they 
did The troops of the Einsatzgruppen had been drafted from the Armed SS a military unit with 
hardly more crimes in its record than any ordinary unit of the German Army and their 
commanders had been chosen by Heydrich from the SS elite with academic degrees Hence the 
problem was how to overcome not so much their conscience as the animal pity by which all 
normal men are affected in the presence of physical suffering The trick used by Himmler  who 
apparently was rather strongly afflicted with these instinctive reactions himself   was very simple 
and probably very effective it consisted in turning these instincts around as it were in directing 
them toward the self So that instead of saying What horrible things I did to people the 
murderers would be able to say What horrible things I had to watch in the pursuance of my 
duties how heavily the task weighed upon my shoulders 
Eichmanns defective memory where Himmlers ingenious watchwords were concerned may be 
an indication that there existed other and more effective devices for solving the problem of 

conscience Foremost among them was as Hitler had rightly foreseen the simple fact of war 
Eichmann insisted time and again on the different personal attitude toward death when dead 
people were seen everywhere and when everyone looked forward to his own death with 
indifference We did not care if we died today or only tomorrow and there were times when we 
cursed the morning that found us still alive Especially effective in this atmosphere of violent 
death was the fact that the Final Solution in its later stages was not carried out by shooting 
hence through violence but in the gas factories which from beginning to end were closely 
connected with the euthanasia program ordered by Hitler in the first weeks of the war and 
applied to the mentally sick in Germany up to the invasion of Russia The extermination program 
that was started in the autumn of  ran as it were on two altogether different tracks One 
track led to the gas factories and the other to the Einsatzgruppen whose operations in the rear 
of the Army especially in Russia were justified by the pretext of partisan warfare and whose 
victims were by no means only Jews In addition to real partisans they dealt with Russian 
functionaries Gypsies the asocial the insane and Jews Jews were included as potential 
enemies and unfortunately it was months before the Russian Jews came to understand this 
and then it was too late to scatter The older generation remembered the First World War when 
the German Army had been greeted as liberators neither the young nor the old had heard 
anything about how Jews were treated in Germany or for that matter in Warsaw they were 
remarkably illinformed as the German Intelligence service reported from White Russia 
Hilberg More remarkable occasionally even German Jews arrived in these regions who were 
under the illusion they had been sent here as pioneers for the Third Reich These mobile killing 
units of which there existed just four each of battalion size with a total of no more than three 
thousand men needed and got the close cooperation of the Armed Forces indeed relations 
between them were usually excellent and in some instances affectionate herzlich The 
generals showed a surprisingly good attitude toward the Jews not only did they hand their Jews 
over to the Einsatzgruppen they often lent their own men ordinary soldiers to assist in the 
massacres The total number of their Jewish victims is estimated by Hilberg to have reached 
almost a million and a half but this was not the result of the Fhrers order for the physical 
extermination of the whole Jewish people It was the result of an earlier order which Hitler gave 
to Himmler in March  to prepare the SS and the police to carry out special duties in 
Russia  
The Fhrers order for the extermination of all not only Russian and Polish Jews though issued 
later can be traced much farther back It originated not in the RSHA or in any of Heydrichs or 
Himmlers other offices but in the Fhrers Chancellery Hitlers personal office It had nothing to 
do with the war and never used military necessities as a pretext It is one of the great merits of 
Gerald Reitlingers The Final Solution to have proved with documentary evidence that leaves no 
doubt that the extermination program in the Eastern gas factories grew out of Hitlers euthanasia 
program and it is deplorable that the Eichmann trial so concerned with historical truth paid no 
attention to this factual connection This would have thrown some light on the much debated 
question of whether Eichmann of the RSHA was involved in Gasgeschichten It is unlikely that 
he was though one of his men Rolf Gnther might have become interested of his own accord 
Globocnik for instance who set up the gassing installations in the Lublin area and whom 
Eichmann visited did not address himself to Himmler or any other police or SS authority when 
he needed more personnel he wrote to Viktor Brack of the Fhrers Chancellery who then 
passed the request on to Himmler 
The first gas chambers were constructed in  to implement a Hitler decree dated September 
 of that year which said that incurably sick persons should be granted a mercy death It was 
probably this medical origin of gassing that inspired Dr Servatiuss amazing conviction that 
killing by gas must be regarded as a medical matter The idea itself was considerably older As 
early as  Hitler had told his Reich Medical Leader Gerhard Wagner that if war came he 
would take up and carry out this question of euthanasia because it was easier to do so in 
wartime The decree was immediately carried out in respect to the mentally sick and between 
December  and August  about fifty thousand Germans were killed with carbon
monoxide gas in institutions where the death rooms were disguised exactly as they later were in 
Auschwitz  as shower rooms and bathrooms The program was a flop It was impossible to keep 
the gassing a secret from the surrounding German population there were protests on all sides 

from people who presumably had not yet attained the objective insight into the nature of 
medicine and the task of a physician The gassing in the East  or to use the language of the 
Nazis the humane way of killing by granting people a mercy death  began on almost the very 
day when the gassing in Germany was stopped The men who had been employed in the 
euthanasia program in Germany were now sent east to build the new installations for the 
extermination of whole peoples  and these men came either from Hitlers Chancellery or from the 
Reich Health Department and were only now put under the administrative authority of Himmler 
None of the various language rules carefully contrived to deceive and to camouflage had a 
more decisive effect on the mentality of the killers than this first war decree of Hitler in which the 
word for murder was replaced by the phrase to grant a mercy death Eichmann asked by the 
police examiner if the directive to avoid unnecessary hardships was not a bit ironic in view of 
the fact that the destination of these people was certain death anyhow did not even understand 
the question so firmly was it still anchored in his mind that the unforgivable sin was not to kill 
people but to cause unnecessary pain During the trial he showed unmistakable signs of sincere 
outrage when witnesses told of cruelties and atrocities committed by SS men  though the court 
and much of the audience failed to see these signs because his singleminded effort to keep his 
selfcontrol had misled them into believing that he was unmovable and indifferent  and it was 
not the accusation of having sent millions of people to their death that ever caused him real 
agitation but only the accusation dismissed by the court of one witness that he had once beaten 
a Jewish boy to death To be sure he had also sent people into the area of the Einsatzgruppen 
who did not grant a mercy death but killed by shooting but he was probably relieved when in 
the later stages of the operation this became unnecessary because of the evergrowing capacity 
of the gas chambers He must also have thought that the new method indicated a decisive 
improvement in the Nazi governments attitude toward the Jews since at the beginning of the 
gassing program it had been expressly stated that the benefits of euthanasia were to be reserved 
for true Germans As the war progressed with violent and horrible death raging all around  on 
the front in Russia in the deserts of Africa in Italy on the beaches of France in the ruins of the 
German cities  the gassing centers in Auschwitz and Chelmno in Majdanek and Belzek in 
Treblinka and Sobibor must actually have appeared the Charitable Foundations for Institutional 
Care that the experts in mercy death called them Moreover from January  on there were 
euthanasia teams operating in the East to help the wounded in ice and snow and though this 
killing of wounded soldiers was also top secret it was known to many certainly to the executors 
of the Final Solution 
It has frequently been pointed out that the gassing of the mentally sick had to be stopped in 
Germany because of protests from the population and from a few courageous dignitaries of the 
churches whereas no such protests were voiced when the program switched to the gassing of 
Jews though some of the killing centers were located on what was then German territory and 
were surrounded by German populations The protests however occurred at the beginning of the 
war quite apart from the effects of education in euthanasia the attitude toward a painless 
death through gassing very likely changed in the course of the war This sort of thing is difficult to 
prove there are no documents to support it because of the secrecy of the whole enterprise and 
none of the war criminals ever mentioned it not even the defendants in the Doctors Trial at 
Nuremberg who were full of quotations from the international literature on the subject Perhaps 
they had forgotten the climate of public opinion in which they killed perhaps they never cared to 
know it since they felt wrongly that their objective and scientific attitude was far more 
advanced than the opinions held by ordinary people However a few truly priceless stories to be 
found in the war diaries of trustworthy men who were fully aware of the fact that their own 
shocked reaction was no longer shared by their neighbors have survived the moral debacle of a 
whole nation 
ReckMalleczewen whom I mentioned before tells of a female leader who came to Bavaria to 
give the peasants a pep talk in the summer of  She seems not to have wasted much time on 
miracle weapons and victory she faced frankly the prospect of defeat about which no good 
German needed to worry because the Fhrer in his great goodness had prepared for the whole 
German people a mild death through gassing in case the war should have an unhappy end And 
the writer adds Oh no Im not imagining things this lovely lady is not a mirage I saw her with 
my own eyes a yellowskinned female pushing forty with insane eyes    And what happened 

Did these Bavarian peasants at least put her into the local lake to cool off her enthusiastic 
readiness for death They did nothing of the sort They went home shaking their heads 
My next story is even more to the point since it concerns someone who was not a leader may 
not even have been a Party member It happened in Knigsberg in East Prussia an altogether 
different corner of Germany in January  a few days before the Russians destroyed the city 
occupied its ruins and annexed the whole province The story is told by Count Hans von 
Lehnsdorff in his Ostpreussisches Tagebuch  He had remained in the city as a physician 
to take care of wounded soldiers who could not be evacuated he was called to one of the huge 
centers for refugees from the countryside which was already occupied by the Red Army There 
he was accosted by a woman who showed him a varicose vein she had had for years but wanted 
to have treated now because she had time I try to explain that it is more important for her to get 
away from Knigsberg and to leave the treatment for some later time Where do you want to go I 
ask her She does not know but she knows that they will all be brought into the Reich And then 
she adds surprisingly The Russians will never get us The Fhrer will never permit it Much 
sooner he will gas us I look around furtively but no one seems to find this statement out of the 
ordinary The story one feels like most true stories is incomplete There should have been one 
more voice preferably a female one which sighing heavily replied And now all that good 
expensive gas has been wasted on the Jews 
 
 
 
VII  The Wannsee Conference or 
Pontius Pilate 
 
 
 
My report on Eichmanns conscience has thus far followed evidence which he himself had 
forgotten In his own presentation of the matter the turning point came not four weeks but four 
months later in January  during the Conference of the Staatssekretre Undersecretaries 
of State as the Nazis used to call it or the Wannsee Conference as it now is usually called 
because Heydrich had invited the gentlemen to a house in that suburb of Berlin As the formal 
name of the conference indicates the meeting had become necessary because the Final 
Solution if it was to be applied to the whole of Europe clearly required more than tacit 
acceptance from the Reichs State apparatus it needed the active cooperation of all Ministries 
and of the whole Civil Service The Ministers themselves nine years after Hitlers rise to power 
were all Party members of long standing  those who in the initial stages of the regime had merely 
coordinated themselves smoothly enough had been replaced Yet most of them were not 
completely trusted since few among them owed their careers entirely to the Nazis as did 
Heydrich or Himmler and those who did like Joachim von Ribbentrop head of the Foreign 
Office a former champagne salesman were likely to be nonentities The problem was much 
more acute however with respect to the higher career men in the Civil Service directly under the 
Ministers for these men the backbone of every government administration were not easily 
replaceable and Hitler had tolerated them just as Adenauer was to tolerate them unless they 
were compromised beyond salvation Hence the undersecretaries and the legal and other experts 
in the various Ministries were frequently not even Party members and Heydrichs apprehensions 
about whether he would be able to enlist the active help of these people in mass murder were 
quite comprehensible As Eichmann put it Heydrich expected the greatest difficulties Well he 
could not have been more wrong 
The aim of the conference was to coordinate all efforts toward the implementation of the Final 
Solution The discussion turned first on complicated legal questions such as the treatment of 
half and quarterJews  should they be killed or only sterilized This was followed by a frank 
discussion of the various types of possible solutions to the problem which meant the various 
methods of killing and here too there was more than happy agreement on the part of the 
participants the Final Solution was greeted with extraordinary enthusiasm by all present and 
particularly by Dr Wilhelm Stuckart Undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior who was known 
to be rather reticent and hesitant in the face of radical Party measures and was according to 

Dr Hans Globkes testimony at Nuremberg a staunch supporter of the Law There were certain 
difficulties however Undersecretary Josef Bhler second in command in the General 
Government in Poland was dismayed at the prospect that Jews would be evacuated from the 
West to the East because this meant more Jews in Poland and he proposed that these 
evacuations be postponed and that the Final Solution be started in the General Government 
where no problems of transport existed The gentlemen from the Foreign Office appeared with 
their own carefully elaborated memorandum expressing the desires and ideas of the Foreign 
Office with respect to the total solution of the Jewish question in Europe to which nobody paid 
much attention The main point as Eichmann rightly noted was that the members of the various 
branches of the Civil Service did not merely express opinions but made concrete propositions 
The meeting lasted no more than an hour or an hour and a half after which drinks were served 
and everybody had lunch  a cozy little social gathering designed to strengthen the necessary 
personal contacts It was a very important occasion for Eichmann who had never before mingled 
socially with so many high personages he was by far the lowest in rank and social position of 
those present He had sent out the invitations and had prepared some statistical material full of 
incredible errors for Heydrichs introductory speech  eleven million Jews had to be killed an 
undertaking of some magnitude  and later he was to prepare the minutes In short he acted as 
secretary of the meeting This was why he was permitted after the dignitaries had left to sit down 
near the fireplace with his chief Mller and Heydrich and that was the first time I saw Heydrich 
smoke and drink They did not talk shop but enjoyed some rest after long hours of work being 
greatly satisfied and especially Heydrich in very high spirits 
There was another reason that made the day of this conference unforgettable for Eichmann 
Although he had been doing his best right along to help with the Final Solution he had still 
harbored some doubts about such a bloody solution through violence and these doubts had 
now been dispelled Here now during this conference the most prominent people had spoken 
the Popes of the Third Reich Now he could see with his own eyes and hear with his own ears 
that not only Hitler not only Heydrich or the sphinx Mller not just the SS or the Party but the 
elite of the good old Civil Service were vying and fighting with each other for the honor of taking 
the lead in these bloody matters At that moment I sensed a kind of Pontius Pilate feeling for I 
felt free of all guilt Who was he to judge Who was he to have his own thoughts in this 
matter Well he was neither the first nor the last to be ruined by modesty 
What followed as Eichmann recalled it went more or less smoothly and soon became routine 
He quickly became an expert in forced evacuation as he had been an expert in forced 
emigration In country after country the Jews had to register were forced to wear the yellow 
badge for easy identification were assembled and deported the various shipments being 
directed to one or another of the extermination centers in the East depending on their relative 
capacity at the moment when a trainload of Jews arrived at a center the strong among them 
were selected for work often operating the extermination machinery all others were immediately 
killed There were hitches but they were minor The Foreign Office was in contact with the 
authorities in those foreign countries that were either occupied or allied with the Nazis to put 
pressure on them to deport their Jews or as the case might be to prevent them from evacuating 
them to the East helterskelter out of sequence without proper regard for the absorptive capacity 
of the death centers This was how Eichmann remembered it it was in fact not quite so simple 
The legal experts drew up the necessary legislation for making the victims stateless which was 
important on two counts it made it impossible for any country to inquire into their fate and it 
enabled the state in which they were resident to confiscate their property The Ministry of Finance 
and the Reichsbank prepared facilities to receive the huge loot from all over Europe down to 
watches and gold teeth all of which was sorted out in the Reichsbank and then sent to the 
Prussian State Mint The Ministry of Transport provided the necessary railroad cars usually 
freight cars even in times of great scarcity of rolling stock and they saw to it that the schedule of 
the deportation trains did not conflict with other timetables The Jewish Councils of Elders were 
informed by Eichmann or his men of how many Jews were needed to fill each train and they 
made out the list of deportees The Jews registered filled out innumerable forms answered 
pages and pages of questionnaires regarding their property so that it could be seized the more 
easily they then assembled at the collection points and boarded the trains The few who tried to 
hide or to escape were rounded up by a special Jewish police force As far as Eichmann could 

see no one protested no one refused to cooperate Immerzu fahren hier die Leute zu ihrem 
eigenen Begrbnis Day in day out the people here leave for their own funeral as a Jewish 
observer put it in Berlin in  
 
Mere compliance would never have been enough either to smooth out all the enormous 
difficulties of an operation that was soon to cover the whole of Nazioccupied and Naziallied 
Europe or to soothe the consciences of the operators who after all had been brought up on the 
commandment Thou shalt not kill and who knew the verse from the Bible Thou hast murdered 
and thou hast inherited that the judgment of the District Court of Jerusalem quoted so 
appropriately What Eichmann called the death whirl that descended upon Germany after the 
immense losses at Stalingrad  the saturation bombing of German cities his stock excuse for 
killing civilians and still the stock excuse offered in Germany for the massacres  making an 
everyday experience of sights different from the atrocities reported at Jerusalem but no less 
horrible might have contributed to the easing or rather to the extinguishing of conscience had 
any conscience been left when it occurred but according to the evidence such was not the case 
The extermination machinery had been planned and perfected in all its details long before the 
horror of war struck Germany herself and its intricate bureaucracy functioned with the same 
unwavering precision in the years of easy victory as in those last years of predictable defeat 
Defections from the ranks of the ruling elite and notably from among the Higher SS officers 
hardly occurred at the beginning when people might still have had a conscience they made 
themselves felt only when it had become obvious that Germany was going to lose the war 
Moreover such defections were never serious enough to throw the machinery out of gear they 
consisted of individual acts not of mercy but of corruption and they were inspired not by 
conscience but by the desire to salt some money or some connections away for the dark days to 
come Himmlers order in the fall of  to halt the extermination and to dismantle the 
installations at the death factories sprang from his absurd but sincere conviction that the Allied 
powers would know how to appreciate this obliging gesture he told a rather incredulous 
Eichmann that on the strength of it he would be able to negotiate a HubertusburgerFrieden  an 
allusion to the Peace Treaty of Hubertusburg that concluded the Seven Years War of Frederick II 
of Prussia in  and enabled Prussia to retain Silesia although she had lost the war 
As Eichmann told it the most potent factor in the soothing of his own conscience was the simple 
fact that he could see no one no one at all who actually was against the Final Solution He did 
encounter one exception however which he mentioned several times and which must have 
made a deep impression on him This happened in Hungary when he was negotiating with Dr 
Kastner over Himmlers offer to release one million Jews in exchange for ten thousand trucks 
Kastner apparently emboldened by the new turn of affairs had asked Eichmann to stop the 
death mills at Auschwitz and Eichmann had answered that he would do it with the greatest 
pleasure herzlich gern but that alas it was outside his competence and outside the 
competence of his superiors  as indeed it was Of course he did not expect the Jews to share 
the general enthusiasm over their destruction but he did expect more than compliance he 
expected  and received to a truly extraordinary degree  their cooperation This was of course 
the very cornerstone of everything he did as it had been the very cornerstone of his activities in 
Vienna Without Jewish help in administrative and police work  the final rounding up of Jews in 
Berlin was as I have mentioned done entirely by Jewish police  there would have been either 
complete chaos or an impossibly severe drain on German manpower There can be no doubt 
that without the cooperation of the victims it would hardly have been possible for a few 
thousand people most of whom moreover worked in offices to liquidate many hundreds of 
thousands of other people    Over the whole way to their deaths the Polish Jews got to see 
hardly more than a handful of Germans Thus R Pendorf in the publication mentioned above To 
an even greater extent this applies to those Jews who were transported to Poland to find their 
deaths there Hence the establishing of Quisling governments in occupied territories was always 
accompanied by the organization of a central Jewish office and as we shall see later where the 
Nazis did not succeed in setting up a puppet government they also failed to enlist the 
cooperation of the Jews But whereas the members of the Quisling governments were usually 
taken from the opposition parties the members of the Jewish Councils were as a rule the locally 
recognized Jewish leaders to whom the Nazis gave enormous powers  until they too were 

deported to Theresienstadt or BergenBelsen if they happened to be from Central or Western 
Europe to Auschwitz if they were from an Eastern European community 
To a Jew this role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the 
darkest chapter of the whole dark story It had been known about before but it has now been 
exposed for the first time in all its pathetic and sordid detail by Raul Hilberg whose standard work 
The Destruction of the European Jews I mentioned before In the matter of cooperation there 
was no distinction between the highly assimilated Jewish communities of Central and Western 
Europe and the Yiddishspeaking masses of the East In Amsterdam as in Warsaw in Berlin as in 
Budapest Jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property to 
secure money from the deportees to defray the expenses of their deportation and extermination 
to keep track of vacated apartments to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on 
trains until as a last gesture they handed over the assets of the Jewish community in good 
order for final confiscation They distributed the Yellow Star badges and sometimes as in 
Warsaw the sale of the armbands became a regular business there were ordinary armbands of 
cloth and fancy plastic armbands which were washable In the Naziinspired but not Nazi
dictated manifestoes they issued we still can sense how they enjoyed their new power  The 
Central Jewish Council has been granted the right of absolute disposal over all Jewish spiritual 
and material wealth and over all Jewish manpower as the first announcement of the Budapest 
Council phrased it We know how the Jewish officials felt when they became instruments of 
murder  like captains whose ships were about to sink and who succeeded in bringing them safe 
to port by casting overboard a great part of their precious cargo like saviors who with a hundred 
victims save a thousand people with a thousand ten thousand The truth was even more 
gruesome Dr Kastner in Hungary for instance saved exactly  people with approximately 
 victims In order not to leave the selection to blind fate truly holy principles were 
needed as the guiding force of the weak human hand which puts down on paper the name of the 
unknown person and with this decides his life or death And whom did these holy principles 
single out for salvation Those who had worked all their lives for the zibur community  ie the 
functionaries  and the most prominent Jews as Kastner says in his report 
No one bothered to swear the Jewish officials to secrecy they were voluntary bearers of 
secrets either in order to assure quiet and prevent panic as in Dr Kastners case or out of 
humane considerations such as that living in the expectation of death by gassing would only 
be the harder as in the case of Dr Leo Baeck former Chief Rabbi of Berlin During the 
Eichmann trial one witness pointed out the unfortunate consequences of this kind of humanity  
people volunteered for deportation from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz and denounced those who 
tried to tell them the truth as being not sane We know the physiognomies of the Jewish leaders 
during the Nazi period very well they ranged all the way from Chaim Rumkowski Eldest of the 
Jews in Ldz called Chaim I who issued currency notes bearing his signature and postage 
stamps engraved with his portrait and who rode around in a brokendown horsedrawn carriage 
through Leo Baeck scholarly mildmannered highly educated who believed Jewish policemen 
would be more gentle and helpful and would make the ordeal easier whereas in fact they 
were of course more brutal and less corruptible since so much more was at stake for them to 
finally a few who committed suicide  like Adam Czerniakow chairman of the Warsaw Jewish 
Council who was not a rabbi but an unbeliever a Polishspeaking Jewish engineer but who must 
still have remembered the rabbinical saying Let them kill you but dont cross the line 
That the prosecution in Jerusalem so careful not to embarrass the Adenauer administration 
should have avoided with even greater and more obvious justification bringing this chapter of the 
story into the open was almost a matter of course These issues however are discussed quite 
openly and with astonishing frankness in Israeli schoolbooks  as may conveniently be gathered 
from the article Young Israelis and Jews Abroad  A Study of Selected History Textbooks by 
Mark M Krug in Comparative Education Review October  The chapter must be included 
here however because it accounts for certain otherwise inexplicable lacunae in the 
documentation of a generally overdocumented case The judges mentioned one such instance 
the absence of H G Adlers book Theresienstadt   which the prosecution in 
some embarrassment admitted to be authentic based on irrefutable sources The reason for 
the omission was clear The book describes in detail how the feared transport lists were put 
together by the Jewish Council of Theresienstadt after the SS had given some general 

directives stipulating how many should be sent away and of what age sex profession and 
country of origin The prosecutions case would have been weakened if it had been forced to 
admit that the naming of individuals who were sent to their doom had been with few exceptions 
the job of the Jewish administration And the Deputy State Attorney Mr Yaakov Baror who 
handled the intervention from the bench in a way indicated this when he said I am trying to 
bring out those things which somehow refer to the accused without damaging the picture in its 
entirety The picture would indeed have been greatly damaged by the inclusion of Adlers book 
since it would have contradicted testimony given by the chief witness on Theresienstadt who 
claimed that Eichmann himself had made these individual selections Even more important the 
prosecutions general picture of a clearcut division between persecutors and victims would have 
suffered greatly To make available evidence that does not support the case for the prosecution is 
usually the job of the defense and the question why Dr Servatius who perceived some minor 
inconsistencies in the testimony did not avail himself of such easily obtainable and widely known 
documentation is difficult to answer He could have pointed to the fact that Eichmann 
immediately upon being transformed from an expert in emigration into an expert in evacuation 
appointed his old Jewish associates in the emigration business  Dr Paul Eppstein who had 
been in charge of emigration in Berlin and Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein who had held the same 
job in Vienna  as Jewish Elders in Theresienstadt This would have done more to demonstrate 
the atmosphere in which Eichmann worked than all the unpleasant and often downright offensive 
talk about oaths loyalty and the virtues of unquestioning obedience 
The testimony of Mrs Charlotte Salzberger on Theresienstadt from which I quoted above 
permitted us to cast at least a glance into this neglected comer of what the prosecution kept 
calling the general picture The presiding judge did not like the term and he did not like the 
picture He told the Attorney General several times that we are not drawing pictures here that 
there is an indictment and this indictment is the framework for our trial that the court has its 
own view about this trial according to the indictment and that the prosecution must adjust to 
what the court lays down  admirable admonitions for criminal proceedings none of which was 
heeded The prosecution did worse than not heed them it simply refused to guide its witnesses  
or if the court became too insistent it asked a few haphazard questions very casually  with the 
result that the witnesses behaved as though they were speakers at a meeting chaired by the 
Attorney General who introduced them to the audience before they took the floor They could talk 
almost as long as they wished and it was a rare occasion when they were asked a specific 
question 
This atmosphere not of a show trial but of a mass meeting at which speaker after speaker does 
his best to arouse the audience was especially noticeable when the prosecution called witness 
after witness to testify to the rising in the Warsaw ghetto and to the similar attempts in Vilna and 
Kovno  matters that had no connection whatever with the crimes of the accused The testimony 
of these people would have contributed something to the trial if they had told of the activities of 
the Jewish Councils which had played such a great and disastrous role in their own heroic 
efforts Of course there was some mention of this  witnesses speaking of SS men and their 
helpers pointed out that they counted among the latter the ghetto police which was also an 
instrument in the hands of the Nazi murderers as well as the Judenrat  but they were only too 
glad not to elaborate on this side of their story and they shifted the discussion to the role of real 
traitors of whom there were few and who were nameless people unknown to the Jewish 
public such as all undergrounds which fought against the Nazis suffered from The audience 
while these witnesses testified had changed again it consisted now of Kibbuzniks members of 
the Israeli communal settlements to which the speakers belonged The purest and clearest 
account came from Zivia Lubetkin Zuckerman today a woman of perhaps forty still very 
beautiful completely free of sentimentality or selfindulgence her facts well organized and 
always quite sure of the point she wished to make Legally the testimony of these witnesses was 
immaterial  Mr Hausner did not mention one of them in his last plaidoyer  except insofar as it 
constituted proof of close contacts between Jewish partisans and the Polish and Russian 
underground fighters which apart from contradicting other testimony We had the whole 
population against us could have been useful to the defense since it offered much better 
justification for the wholesale slaughter of civilians than Eichmanns repeated claim that 
Weizmann had declared war on Germany in  This was sheer nonsense All that Chaim 

Weizmann had said at the close of the last prewar Zionist Congress was that the war of the 
Western democracies is our war their struggle is our struggle The tragedy as Hausner rightly 
pointed out was precisely that the Jews were not recognized by the Nazis as belligerents for if 
they had been they would have survived in prisonerofwar or civilian internment camps Had Dr 
Servatius made this point the prosecution would have been forced to admit how pitifully small 
these resistance groups had been how incredibly weak and essentially harmless  and 
moreover how little they had represented the Jewish population who at one point even took 
arms against them 
While the legal irrelevance of all this very timeconsuming testimony remained pitifully clear the 
political intention of the Israeli government in introducing it was also not difficult to guess Mr 
Hausner or Mr BenGurion probably wanted to demonstrate that whatever resistance there had 
been had come from Zionists as though of all Jews only the Zionists knew that if you could not 
save your life it might still be worth while to save your honor as Mr Zuckerman put it that the 
worst that could happen to the human person under such circumstances was to be and to remain 
innocent as became clear from the tenor and drift of Mrs Zuckermans testimony However 
these political intentions misfired for the witnesses were truthful and told the court that all 
Jewish organizations and parties had played their role in the resistance so the true distinction 
was not between Zionists and nonZionists but between organized and unorganized people and 
even more important between the young and the middleaged To be sure those who resisted 
were a minority a tiny minority but under the circumstances the miracle was as one of them 
pointed out that this minority existed 
Legal considerations aside the appearance in the witness box of the former Jewish resistance 
fighters was welcome enough It dissipated the haunting specter of universal cooperation the 
stifling poisoned atmosphere which had surrounded the Final Solution The wellknown fact that 
the actual work of killing in the extermination centers was usually in the hands of Jewish 
commandos had been fairly and squarely established by witnesses for the prosecution  how they 
had worked in the gas chambers and the crematories how they had pulled the gold teeth and cut 
the hair of the corpses how they had dug the graves and later dug them up again to extinguish 
the traces of mass murder how Jewish technicians had built gas chambers in Theresienstadt 
where the Jewish autonomy had been carried so far that even the hangman was a Jew But this 
was only horrible it was no moral problem The selection and classification of workers in the 
camps was made by the SS who had a marked predilection for the criminal elements and 
anyhow it could only have been the selection of the worst This was especially true in Poland 
where the Nazis had exterminated a large proportion of the Jewish intelligentsia at the same time 
that they killed Polish intellectuals and members of the professions  in marked contrast 
incidentally to their policy in Western Europe where they tended to save prominent Jews in order 
to exchange them for German civilian internees or prisoners of war BergenBelsen was originally 
a camp for exchange Jews The moral problem lay in the amount of truth there was in 
Eichmanns description of Jewish cooperation even under the conditions of the Final Solution 
The formation of the Jewish Council at Theresienstadt and the distribution of business was left 
to the discretion of the Council except for the appointment of the president who the president 
was to be which depended upon us of course However this appointment was not in the form of 
a dictatorial decision The functionaries with whom we were in constant contact  well they had to 
be treated with kid gloves They were not ordered around for the simple reason that if the chief 
officials had been told what to do in the form of you must you have to that would not have 
helped matters any If the person in question does not like what he is doing the whole works will 
suffer    We did our best to make everything somehow palatable No doubt they did the 
problem is how it was possible for them to succeed 
Thus the gravest omission from the general picture was that of a witness to testify to the 
cooperation between the Nazi rulers and the Jewish authorities and hence of an opportunity to 
raise the question Why did you cooperate in the destruction of your own people and eventually 
in your own ruin The only witness who had been a prominent member of a Judenrat was 
Pinchas Freudiger the former Baron Philip von Freudiger of Budapest and during his testimony 
the only serious incidents in the audience took place people screamed at the witness in 
Hungarian and in Yiddish and the court had to interrupt the session Freudiger an Orthodox Jew 
of considerable dignity was shaken There are people here who say they were not told to 

escape But fifty per cent of the people who escaped were captured and killed  as compared 
with ninetynine per cent for those who did not escape Where could they have gone to Where 
could they have fled  but he himself fled to Rumania because he was rich and Wisliceny 
helped him What could we have done What could we have done And the only response to 
this came from the presiding judge I do not think this is an answer to the question  a question 
raised by the gallery but not by the court 
The matter of cooperation was twice mentioned by the judges Judge Yitzak Raveh elicited from 
one of the resistance witnesses an admission that the ghetto police were an instrument in the 
hands of murderers and an acknowledgment of the Judenrats policy of cooperating with the 
Nazis and Judge Halevi found out from Eichmann in crossexamination that the Nazis had 
regarded this cooperation as the very cornerstone of their Jewish policy But the question the 
prosecutor regularly addressed to each witness except the resistance fighters which sounded so 
very natural to those who knew nothing of the factual background of the trial the question Why 
did you not rebel actually served as a smoke screen for the question that was not asked And 
thus it came to pass that all answers to the unanswerable question Mr Hausner put to his 
witnesses were considerably less than the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth True 
it was that the Jewish people as a whole had not been organized that they had possessed no 
territory no government and no army that in the hour of their greatest need they had no 
governmentinexile to represent them among the Allies the Jewish Agency for Palestine under 
Dr Weizmanns presidency was at best a miserable substitute no caches of weapons no youth 
with military training But the whole truth was that there existed Jewish community organizations 
and Jewish party and welfare organizations on both the local and the international level 
Wherever Jews lived there were recognized Jewish leaders and this leadership almost without 
exception cooperated in one way or another for one reason or another with the Nazis The 
whole truth was that if the Jewish people had really been unorganized and leaderless there 
would have been chaos and plenty of misery but the total number of victims would hardly have 
been between four and a half and six million people According to Freudigers calculations about 
half of them could have saved themselves if they had not followed the instructions of the Jewish 
Councils This is of course a mere estimate which however oddly jibes with the rather reliable 
figures we have from Holland and which I owe to Dr L de Jong the head of the Netherlands 
State Institute for War Documentation In Holland where the Joodsche Raad like all the Dutch 
authorities very quickly became an instrument of the Nazis  Jews were deported to the 
death camps and some five thousand to Theresienstadt in the usual way ie with the 
cooperation of the Jewish Council Only five hundred and nineteen Jews returned from the death 
camps In contrast to this figure ten thousand of those twenty to twentyfive thousand Jews who 
escaped the Nazis  and that meant also the Jewish Council  and went underground survived 
again forty to fifty per cent Most of the Jews sent to Theresienstadt returned to Holland 
I have dwelt on this chapter of the story which the Jerusalem trial failed to put before the eyes of 
the world in its true dimensions because it offers the most striking insight into the totality of the 
moral collapse the Nazis caused in respectable European society  not only in Germany but in 
almost all countries not only among the persecutors but also among the victims Eichmann in 
contrast to other elements in the Nazi movement had always been overawed by good society 
and the politeness he often showed to Germanspeaking Jewish functionaries was to a large 
extent the result of his recognition that he was dealing with people who were socially his 
superiors He was not at all as one witness called him a Landsknechtnatur a mercenary who 
wanted to escape to regions where there arent no Ten Commandments an a man can raise a 
thirst What he fervently believed in up to the end was success the chief standard of good 
society as he knew it Typical was his last word on the subject of Hitler  whom he and his 
comrade Sassen had agreed to shirr out of their story Hitler he said may have been wrong all 
down the line but one thing is beyond dispute the man was able to work his way up from lance 
corporal in the German Army to Fhrer of a people of almost eighty million    His success alone 
proved to me that I should subordinate myself to this man His conscience was indeed set at rest 
when he saw the zeal and eagerness with which good society everywhere reacted as he did 
He did not need to close his ears to the voice of conscience as the judgment has it not 
because he had none but because his conscience spoke with a respectable voice with the 
voice of respectable society around him 

That there were no voices from the outside to arouse his conscience was one of Eichmanns 
points and it was the task of the prosecution to prove that this was not so that there were voices 
he could have listened to and that anyhow he had done his work with a zeal far beyond the call 
of duty Which turned out to be true enough except that strange as it may appear his murderous 
zeal was not altogether unconnected with the ambiguity in the voices of those who at one time or 
another tried to restrain him We need mention here only in passing the socalled inner 
emigration in Germany  those people who frequently had held positions even high ones in the 
Third Reich and who after the end of the war told themselves and the world at large that they 
had always been inwardly opposed to the regime The question here is not whether or not they 
are telling the truth the point is rather that no secret in the secretridden atmosphere of the 
Hitler regime was better kept than such inward opposition This was almost a matter of course 
under the conditions of Nazi terror as a rather wellknown inner emigrant who certainly 
believed in his own sincerity once told me they had to appear outwardly even more like Nazis 
than ordinary Nazis did in order to keep their secret This incidentally may explain why the few 
known protests against the extermination program came not from the Army commanders but from 
old Party members Hence the only possible way to live in the Third Reich and not act as a Nazi 
was not to appear at all Withdrawal from significant participation in public life was indeed the 
only criterion by which one might have measured individual guilt as Otto Kirchheimer recently 
remarked in his Political Justice  If the term was to make any sense the inner emigrant 
could only be one who lived as though outcast among his own people amidst blindly believing 
masses as Professor Hermann Jahrreiss pointed out in his Statement for All Defense 
Attorneys before the Nuremberg Tribunal For opposition was indeed utterly pointless in the 
absence of all organization It is true that there were Germans who lived for twelve years in this 
outer cold but their number was insignificant even among the members of the resistance In 
recent years the slogan of the inner emigration the term itself has a definitely equivocal flavor 
as it can mean either an emigration into the inward regions of ones soul or a way of conducting 
oneself as though he were an emigrant has become a sort of a joke The sinister Dr Otto 
Bradfisch former member of one of the Einsatzgruppen who presided over the killing of at least 
fifteen thousand people told a German court that he had always been inwardly opposed to what 
he was doing Perhaps the death of fifteen thousand people was necessary to provide him with 
an alibi in the eyes of true Nazis The same argument was advanced though with considerably 
less success in a Polish court by former Gauleiter Arthur Greiser of the Warthegau only his 
official soul had carried out the crimes for which he was hanged in  his private soul had 
always been against them  
While Eichmann may never have encountered an inner emigrant he must have been well 
acquainted with many of those numerous civil servants who today assert that they stayed in their 
jobs for no other reason than to mitigate matters and to prevent real Nazis from taking over 
their posts We mentioned the famous case of Dr Hans Globke Undersecretary of State and 
from  to  chief of the personnel division in the West German Chancellery Since he was 
the only civil servant in this category to be mentioned during the trial it may be worth while to look 
into his mitigating activities Dr Globke had been employed in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior 
before Hitlers rise to power and had shown there a rather premature interest in the Jewish 
question He formulated the first of the directives in which proof of Aryan descent was 
demanded in this case of persons who applied for permission to change their names This 
circular letter of December   issued at a time when Hitlers rise to power was not yet a 
certainty but a strong probability  oddly anticipated the top secret decrees that is the typically 
totalitarian rule by means of laws that are not brought to the attention of the public which the 
Hitler regime introduced much later in notifying the recipients that these directives are not for 
publication Dr Globke as I have mentioned kept his interest in names and since it is true that 
his Commentary on the Nuremberg Laws of  was considerably harsher than the earlier 
interpretation of Rassenschande by the Ministry of the Interiors expert on Jewish affairs Dr 
Bernhard Lsener an old member of the Party one could even accuse him of having made 
things worse than they were under real Nazis But even if we were to grant him all his good 
intentions it is hard indeed to see what he could have done under the circumstances to make 
things better than they would otherwise have been Recently however a German newspaper 
after much searching came up with an answer to this puzzling question They found a document 

duly signed by Dr Globke which decreed that Czech brides of German soldiers had to furnish 
photographs of themselves in bathing suits in order to obtain a marriage license And Dr Globke 
explained With this confidential ordinance a threeyearold scandal was somewhat mitigated 
for until his intervention Czech brides had to furnish snapshots that showed them stark naked 
 
Dr Globke as he explained at Nuremberg was fortunate in that he worked under the orders of 
another mitigator Staatssekretr Undersecretary of State Wilhelm Stuckart whom we met as 
one of the eager members of the Wannsee Conference Stuckarts attenuation activities 
concerned halfJews whom he proposed to sterilize The Nuremberg court in possession of the 
minutes of the Wannsee Conference may not have believed that he had known nothing of the 
extermination program but it sentenced him to time served on account of ill health A German 
denazification court fined him five hundred marks and declared him a nominal member of the 
Party   a Mitlufer  although they must have known at least that Stuckart belonged to the old 
guard of the Party and had joined the SS early as an honorary member Clearly the story of 
the mitigators in Hitlers offices belongs among the postwar fairy tales and we can dismiss 
them too as voices that might possibly have reached Eichmanns conscience 
The question of these voices became serious in Jerusalem with the appearance in court of 
Propst Heinrich Grber a Protestant minister who had come to the trial as the only German 
and incidentally except for Judge Michael Musmanno from the United States the only non
Jewish witness for the prosecution German witnesses for the defense were excluded from the 
outset since they would have exposed themselves to arrest and prosecution in Israel under the 
same law as that under which Eichmann was tried Propst Grber had belonged to the 
numerically small and politically irrelevant group of persons who were opposed to Hitler on 
principle and not out of nationalist considerations and whose stand on the Jewish question had 
been without equivocation He promised to be a splendid witness since Eichmann had 
negotiated with him several times and his mere appearance in the courtroom created a kind of 
sensation Unfortunately his testimony was vague he did not remember after so many years 
when he had spoken with Eichmann or and this was more serious on what subjects All he 
recalled clearly was that he had once asked for unleavened bread to be shipped to Hungary for 
Passover and that l e had traveled to Switzerland during the war to tell his Christian friends how 
dangerous the situation was and to urge that more opportunities for emigration be provided The 
negotiations must have taken place prior to the implementing of the Final Solution which 
coincided with Himmlers decree forbidding all emigration they probably occurred before the 
invasion of Russia He got his unleavened bread and he got safely to Switzerland and back 
again His troubles started later when the deportations had begun Propst Grber and his group 
of Protestant clergymen first intervened merely on behalf of people who had been wounded in 
the course of the First World War and of those who had been awarded high military decorations 
on behalf of the old and on behalf of the widows of those killed in World War I These categories 
corresponded to those that had originally been exempted by the Nazis themselves Now Grber 
was told that what he was doing ran counter to the policy of the government but nothing serious 
happened to him But shortly after this Propst Grber did something really extraordinary he tried 
to reach the concentration camp of Gurs in southern France where Vichy France had interned 
together with German Jewish refugees some seventyfive hundred Jews from Baden and the 
Saarpfalz whom Eichmann had smuggled across the GermanFrench border in the fall of  
and who according to Propst Grbers information were even worse off than the Jews deported 
to Poland The result of this attempt was that he was arrested and put in a concentration camp  
first in Sachsenhausen and then in Dachau A similar fate befell the Catholic priest Dompropst 
Bernard Lichtenberg of St Hedwigs Cathedral in Berlin he not only had dared to pray publicly 
for all Jews baptized or not  which was considerably more dangerous than to intervene for 
special cases  but he had also demanded that he be allowed to join the Jews on their journey 
to the East He died on his way to a concentration camp 
Apart from testifying to the existence of another Germany Propst Grber did not contribute 
much to either the legal or the historical significance of the trial He was full of pat judgments 
about Eichmann  he was like a block of ice like marble a Landsknechtsnatur a bicycle 
rider a current German idiom for someone who kowtows to his superiors and kicks his 
subordinates  none of which showed him as a particularly good psychologist quite apart from 

the fact that the bicycle rider charge was contradicted by evidence which showed Eichmann to 
have been rather decent toward his subordinates Anyway these were interpretations and 
conclusions that would normally have been stricken from any court record  though in Jerusalem 
they even found their way into the judgment Without them Propst Grbers testimony could have 
strengthened the case for the defense for Eichmann had never given Grber a direct answer he 
had always told him to come back as he had to ask for further instructions More important Dr 
Servatius for once took the initiative and asked the witness a highly pertinent question Did you 
try to influence him Did you as a clergyman try to appeal to his feelings preach to him and tell 
him that his conduct was contrary to morality Of course the very courageous Propst had done 
nothing of the sort and his answers now were highly embarrassing He said that deeds are more 
effective than words and that words would have been useless he spoke in clichs that had 
nothing to do with the reality of the situation where mere words would have been deeds and 
where it had perhaps been the duty of a clergyman to test the uselessness of words 
Even more pertinent than Dr Servatius question was what Eichmann said about this episode in 
his last statement Nobody he repeated came to me and reproached me for anything in the 
performance of my duties Not even Pastor Grber claims to have done so He then added He 
came to me and sought alleviation of suffering but did not actually object to the very performance 
of my duties as such From Propst Grbers own testimony it appeared that he sought not so 
much alleviation of suffering as exemptions from it in accordance with wellestablished 
categories recognized earlier by the Nazis The categories had been accepted without protest by 
German Jewry from the very beginning And the acceptance of privileged categories  German 
Jews as against Polish Jews war veterans and decorated Jews as against ordinary Jews 
families whose ancestors were Germanborn as against recently naturalized citizens etc  had 
been the beginning of the moral collapse of respectable Jewish society In view of the fact that 
today such matters are often treated as though there existed a law of human nature compelling 
everybody to lose his dignity in the face of disaster we may recall the attitude of the French 
Jewish war veterans who were offered the same privileges by their government and replied We 
solemnly declare that we renounce any exceptional benefits we may derive from our status as ex
servicemen American Jewish Yearbook  Needless to say the Nazis themselves never 
took these distinctions seriously for them a Jew was a Jew but the categories played a certain 
role up to the very end since they helped put to rest a certain uneasiness among the German 
population only Polish Jews were deported only people who had shirked military service and so 
on For those who did not want to close their eyes it must have been clear from the beginning that 
it was a general practice to allow certain exceptions in order to be able to maintain the general 
rule all the more easily in the words of Louis de Jong in an illuminating article on Jews and 
NonJews in NaziOccupied Holland 
What was morally so disastrous in the acceptance of these privileged categories was that 
everyone who demanded to have an exception made in his case implicitly recognized the rule 
but this point apparently was never grasped by these good men Jewish and Gentile who 
busied themselves about all those special cases for which preferential treatment could be 
asked The extent to which even the Jewish victims had accepted the standards of the Final 
Solution is perhaps nowhere more glaringly evident than in the socalled Kastner Report 
available in German Der KastnerBericht ber Eichmanns Menschenhandel in Ungarn  
Even after the end of the war Kastner was proud of his success in saving prominent Jews a 
category officially introduced by the Nazis in  as though in his view too it went without 
saying that a famous Jew had more right to stay alive than an ordinary one to take upon himself 
such responsibilities  to help the Nazis in their efforts to pick out famous people from the 
anonymous mass for this is what it amounted to  required more courage than to face death 
But if the Jewish and Gentile pleaders of special cases were unaware of their involuntary 
complicity this implicit recognition of the rule which spelled death for all nonspecial cases must 
have been very obvious to those who were engaged in the business of murder They must have 
felt at least that by being asked to make exceptions and by occasionally granting them and 
thus earning gratitude they had convinced their opponents of the lawfulness of what they were 
doing 
Moreover Propst Grber and the Jerusalem court were quite mistaken in assuming that requests 
for exemptions originated only with opponents of the regime On the contrary as Heydrich 

explicitly stated during the Wannsee Conference the establishment of Theresienstadt as a ghetto 
for privileged categories was prompted by the great number of such interventions from all sides 
Theresienstadt later became a showplace for visitors from abroad and served to deceive the 
outside world but this was not its original raison dtre The horrible thinningout process that 
regularly occurred in this paradise  distinguished from other camps as day is from night as 
Eichmann rightly remarked  was necessary because there was never enough room to provide for 
all who were privileged and we know from a directive issued by Ernst Kaltenbrunner head of the 
RSHA that special care was taken not to deport Jews with connections and important 
acquaintances in the outside world In other words the less prominent Jews were constantly 
sacrificed to those whose disappearance in the East would create unpleasant inquiries The 
acquaintances in the outside world did not necessarily live outside Germany according to 
Himmler there were eighty million good Germans each of whom has his decent Jew It is clear 
the others are pigs but this particular Jew is firstrate Hilberg Hitler himself is said to have 
known three hundred and forty firstrate Jews whom he had either altogether assimilated to the 
status of Germans or granted the privileges of halfJews Thousands of halfJews had been 
exempted from all restrictions which might explain Heydrichs role in the SS and 
Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milchs role in Grings Air Force for it was generally known that 
Heydrich and Milch were halfJews Among the major war criminals only two repented in the 
face of death Heydrich during the nine days it took him to die from the wounds inflicted by Czech 
patriots and Hans Frank in his death cell at Nuremberg It is an uncomfortable fact for it is 
difficult not to suspect that what Heydrich at least repented of was not murder but that he had 
betrayed his own people If interventions on behalf of prominent Jews came from prominent 
people they often were quite successful Thus Sven Hedin one of Hitlers most ardent admirers 
intervened for a wellknown geographer a Professor Philippsohn of Bonn who was living under 
undignified conditions at Theresienstadt in a letter to Hitler Hedin threatened that his attitude to 
Germany would be dependent upon Philippsohns fate whereupon according to H G Adlers 
book on Thercsienstadt Mr Philippsohn was promptly provided with better quarters 
In Germany today this notion of prominent Jews has not yet been forgotten While the veterans 
and other privileged groups are no longer mentioned the fate of famous Jews is still deplored at 
the expense of all others There are more than a few people especially among the cultural lite 
who still publicly regret the fact that Germany sent Einstein packing without realizing that it was a 
much greater crime to kill little Hans Cohn from around the corner even though he was no 
genius 
 
 
 
VIII Duties of a LawAbiding Citizen 
 
 
 
So Eichmanns opportunities for feeling like Pontius Pilate were many and as the months and the 
years went by he lost the need to feel anything at all This was the way things were this was the 
new law of the land based on the Fhrers order whatever he did he did as far as he could see 
as a lawabiding citizen He did his duty as he told the police and the court over and over again 
he not only obeyed orders he also obeyed the law Eichmann had a muddled inkling that this 
could be an important distinction but neither the defense nor the judges ever took him up on it 
The wellworn coins of superior orders versus acts of state were handed back and forth they 
had governed the whole discussion of these matters during the Nuremberg Trials for no other 
reason than that they gave the illusion that the altogether unprecedented could be judged 
according to precedents and the standards that went with them Eichmann with his rather modest 
mental gifts was certainly the last man in the courtroom to be expected to challenge these 
notions and to strike out on his own Since in addition to performing what he conceived to be the 
duties of a lawabiding citizen he had also acted upon orders  always so careful to be covered 
 he became completely muddled and ended by stressing alternately the virtues and the vices of 
blind obedience or the obedience of corpses Kadavergehorsam as he himself called it 
The first indication of Eichmanns vague notion that there was more involved in this whole 

business than the question of the soldiers carrying out orders that are clearly criminal in nature 
and intent appeared during the police examination when he suddenly declared with great 
emphasis that he had lived his whole life according to Kants moral precepts and especially 
according to a Kantian definition of duty This was outrageous on the face of it and also 
incomprehensible since Kants moral philosophy is so closely bound up with mans faculty of 
judgment which rules out blind obedience The examining officer did not press the point but 
Judge Raveh either out of curiosity or out of indignation at Eichmanns having dared to invoke 
Kants name in connection with his crimes decided to question the accused And to the surprise 
of everybody Eichmann came up with an approximately correct definition of the categorical 
imperative I meant by my remark about Kant that the principle of my will must always be such 
that it can become the principle of general laws which is not the case with theft or murder for 
instance because the thief or the murderer cannot conceivably wish to live under a legal system 
that would give others the right to rob or murder him Upon further questioning he added that he 
had read Kants Critique of Practical Reason He then proceeded to explain that from the moment 
he was charged with carrying out the Final Solution he had ceased to live according to Kantian 
principles that he had known it and that he had consoled himself with the thought that he no 
longer was master of his own deeds that he was unable to change anything What he failed to 
point out in court was that in this period of crimes legalized by the state as he himself now 
called it he had not simply dismissed the Kantian formula as no longer applicable he had 
distorted it to read Act as if the principle of your actions were the same as that of the legislator or 
of the law of the land  or in Hans Franks formulation of the categorical imperative in the Third 
Reich which Eichmann might have known Act in such a way that the Fhrer if he knew your 
action would approve it Die Technik des Staates  pp  Kant to be sure had never 
intended to say anything of the sort on the contrary to him every man was a legislator the 
moment he started to act by using his practical reason man found the principles that could and 
should be the principles of law But it is true that Eichmanns unconscious distortion agrees with 
what he himself called the version of Kant for the household use of the little man In this 
household use all that is left of Kants spirit is the demand that a man do more than obey the law 
that he go beyond the mere call of obedience and identify his own will with the principle behind 
the law  the source from which the law sprang In Kants philosophy that source was practical 
reason in Eichmanns household use of him it was the will of the Fhrer Much of the horribly 
painstaking thoroughness in the execution of the Final Solution  a thoroughness that usually 
strikes the observer as typically German or else as characteristic of the perfect bureaucrat  can 
be traced to the odd notion indeed very common in Germany that to be lawabiding means not 
merely to obey the laws but to act as though one were the legisator of the laws that one obeys 
Hence the the conviction that nothing less than going beyond the call of duty will do 
Whatever Kants role in the formation of the little mans mentality in Germany may have been 
there is not the slightest doubt that in one respect Eichmann did indeed follow Kants precepts a 
law was a law there could be no exceptions In Jerusalem he admitted only two such exceptions 
during the time when eighty million Germans had each had his decent Jew he had helped a 
halfJewish cousin and a Jewish couple in Vienna for whom his uncle had intervened This 
inconsistency still made him feel somewhat uncomfortable and when he was questioned about it 
during crossexamination he became openly apologetic he had confessed his sins to his 
superiors This uncompromising attitude toward the performance of his murderous duties damned 
him in the eyes of the judges more than anything else which was comprehensible but in his own 
eyes it was precisely what justified him as it had once silenced whatever conscience he might 
have had left No exceptions  this was the proof that he had always acted against his 
inclinations whether they were sentimental or inspired by interest that he had always done his 
duty 
Doing his duty finally brought him into open conflict with orders from his superiors During the 
last year of the war more than two years after the Wannsee Conference he experienced his last 
crisis of conscience As the defeat approached he was confronted by men from his own ranks 
who fought more and more insistently for exceptions and eventually for the cessation of the 
Final Solution That was the moment when his caution broke down and he began once more 
taking initiatives  for instance he organized the foot marches of Jews from Budapest to the 
Austrian border after Allied bombing had knocked out the transportation system It now was the 

fall of  and Eichmann knew that Himmler had ordered the dismantling of the extermination 
facilities in Auschwitz and that the game was up Around this time Eichmann had one of his very 
few personal interviews with Himmler in the course of which the latter allegedly shouted at him 
If up to now you have been busy liquidating Jews you will from now on since I order it take 
good care of Jews act as their nursemaid I remind you that it was I  and neither Gruppenfhrer 
Mller nor you  who founded the RSHA in  I am the one who gives orders here Sole 
witness to substantiate these words was the very dubious Mr Kurt Becher Eichmann denied that 
Himmler had shouted at him but he did not deny that such an interview had taken place Himmler 
cannot have spoken in precisely these words he surely knew that the RSHA was founded in 
 not in  and not simply by himself but by Heydrich with his endorsement Still 
something of the sort must have occurred Himmler was then giving orders right and left that the 
Jews be treated well  they were his soundest investment  and it must have been a shattering 
experience for Eichmann 
 
Eichmanns last crisis of conscience began with his missions to Hungary in March  when 
the Red Army was moving through the Carpathian Mountains toward the Hungarian border 
Hungary had joined the war on Hitlers side in  for no other reason than to receive some 
additional territory from her neighbors Slovakia Rumania and Yugoslavia The Hungarian 
government had been outspokenly antiSemitic even before that and now it began to deport all 
stateless Jews from the newly acquired territories In nearly all countries antiJewish action 
started with stateless persons This was quite outside the Final Solution and as a matter of fact 
didnt fit in with the elaborate plans then in preparation under which Europe would be combed 
from West to East so that Hungary had a rather low priority in the order of operations The 
stateless Jews had been shoved by the Hungarian police into the nearest part of Russia and the 
German occupation authorities on the spot had protested their arrival the Hungarians had taken 
back some thousands of ablebodied men and had let the others be shot by Hungarian troops 
under the guidance of German police units Admiral Horthy the countrys Fascist ruler had not 
wanted to go any further however  probably due to the restraining influence of Mussolini and 
Italian Fascism  and in the intervening years Hungary not unlike Italy had become a haven for 
Jews to which even refugees from Poland and Slovakia could sometimes still escape The 
annexation of territory and the trickle of incoming refugees had increased the number of Jews in 
Hungary from about five hundred thousand before the war to approximately eight hundred 
thousand in  when Eichmann moved in 
As we know today the safety of these three hundred thousand Jews newly acquired by Hungary 
was due to the Germans reluctance to start a separate action for a limited number rather than to 
the Hungarians eagerness to offer asylum In  under pressure from the German Foreign 
Office which never failed to make it clear to Germanys allies that the touchstone of their 
trustworthiness was their helpfulness not in winning the war but in solving the Jewish question 
Hungary had offered to hand over all Jewish refugees The Foreign Office had been willing to 
accept this as a step in the right direction but Eichmann had objected for technical reasons he 
thought it preferable to defer this action until Hungary is ready to include the Hungarian Jews it 
would be too costly to set in motion the whole machinery of evacuation for only one category 
and hence without making any progress in the solution of the Jewish problem in Hungary Now 
in  Hungary was ready because on the nineteenth of March two divisions of the German 
Army had occupied the country With them had arrived the new Reich Plenipotentiary SS 
Standartenfhrer Dr Edmund Veesenmayer Himmlers agent in the Foreign Office and SS 
Obergruppenfhrer Otto Winkelmann a member of the Higher SS and Police Leader Corps and 
therefore under the direct command of Himmler The third SS official to arrive in the country was 
Eichmann the expert on Jewish evacuation and deportation who was under the command of 
Mller and Kaltenbrunner of the RSHA Hitler himself had left no doubt what the arrival of the 
three gentlemen meant in a famous interview prior to the occupation of the country he had told 
Horthy that Hungary had not yet introduced the steps necessary to settle the Jewish question 
and had charged him with not having permitted the Jews to be massacred Hilberg 
Eichmanns assignment was clear His whole office was moved to Budapest in terms of his 
career this was a gliding down to enable him to see to it that all necessary steps were taken 
He had no foreboding of what was to happen his worst fear concerned possible resistance on the 

part of the Hungarians which he would have been unable to cope with because he lacked 
manpower and also lacked knowledge of local conditions These fears proved quite unfounded 
The Hungarian gendarmerie was more than eager to do all that was necessary and the new 
State Secretary in Charge of Political Jewish Affairs in the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior 
Lszlo Endre was a man well versed in the Jewish problem and became an intimate friend 
with whom Eichmann could spend a good deal of his free time Everything went like a dream as 
he repeated whenever he recalled this episode there were no difficulties whatsoever Unless of 
course one calls difficulties a few minor differences between his orders and the wishes of his 
new friends for instance probably because of the approach of the Red Army from the East his 
orders stipulated that the country was to be combed from East to West which meant that 
Budapest Jews would not be evacuated during the first weeks or months  a matter for great grief 
among the Hungarians who wanted their capital to take the lead in becoming judenrein 
Eichmanns dream was an incredible nightmare for the Jews nowhere else were so many 
people deported and exterminated in such a brief span of time In less than two months  
trains carrying  people in sealed freight cars a hundred persons to a car left the country 
and the gas chambers of Auschwitz were hardly able to cope with this multitude 
The difficulties arose from another quarter Not one man but three had orders specifying that they 
were to help in the solution of the Jewish problem each of them belonged to a different outfit 
and stood in a different chain of command Technically Winkelmann was Eichmanns superior 
but the Higher SS and Police Leaders were not under the command of the RSHA to which 
Eichmann belonged And Veesenmayer of the Foreign Office was independent of both At any 
rate Eichmann refused to take orders from either of the others and resented their presence But 
the worst trouble came from a fourth man whom Himmler had charged with a special mission in 
the only country in Europe that still harbored not only a sizable number of Jews but Jews who 
were still in an important economic position Of a total of a hundred and ten thousand 
commercial stores and industrial enterprises in Hungary forty thousand were reported to be in 
Jewish hands This man was Obersturmbannfhrer later Standartenfhrer Kurt Becher 
Becher an old enemy of Eichmann who is today a prosperous merchant in Bremen was called 
strangely enough as a witness for the defense He could not come to Jerusalem for obvious 
reasons and he was examined in his German home town His testimony had to be dismissed 
since he had been shown well ahead of time the questions he was later called on to answer 
under oath It was a great pity that Eichmann and Becher could not have been confronted with 
each other and this not merely for juridical reasons Such a confrontation would have revealed 
another part of the general picture which even legally was far from irrelevant According to his 
own account the reason Becher joined the SS was that from  to the present day he had 
been actively engaged in horseback riding Thirty years ago this was a sport engaged in only 
by Europes upper classes In  his instructor had persuaded him to enter the SS cavalry 
regiment which at that moment was the very thing for a man to do if he wished to join the 
movement and at the same time maintain a proper regard for his social standing A possible 
reason Becher in his testimony stressed horseback riding was never mentioned the Nuremberg 
Tribunal had excluded the ReiterSS from its list of criminal organizations The war saw Becher 
on active duty at the front as a member not of the Army but of the Armed SS in which he was a 
liaison officer with the Army commanders He soon left the front to become the principal buyer of 
horses for the SS personnel department a job that earned him nearly all the decorations that 
were then available 
Becher claimed that he had been sent to Hungary only in order to buy twenty thousand horses for 
the SS this is unlikely since immediately upon his arrival he began a series of very successful 
negotiations with the heads of big Jewish business concerns His relations with Himmler were 
excellent he could see him whenever he wished His special mission was clear enough He 
was to obtain control of major Jewish business concerns behind the backs of the Hungarian 
government and in return to give the owners free passage out of the country plus a sizable 
amount of money in foreign currency His most important transaction was with the Manfred Weiss 
steel combine a mammoth enterprise with thirty thousand workers which produced everything 
from airplanes trucks and bicycles to tinned goods pins and needles The result was that forty
five members of the Weiss family emigrated to Portugal while Mr Becher became head of their 
business When Eichmann heard of this Schweinerei he was outraged the deal threatened to 

compromise his good relations with the Hungarians who naturally expected to take possession of 
Jewish property confiscated on their own soil He had some reason for his indignation since 
these deals were contrary to the regular Nazi policy which had been quite generous For their 
help in solving the Jewish question in any country the Germans had demanded no part of the 
Jews property only the costs of their deportation and extermination and these costs had varied 
widely from country to country  the Slovaks had been supposed to pay between three hundred 
and five hundred Reichsmarks per Jew the Croats only thirty the French seven hundred and the 
Belgians two hundred and fifty It seems that no one ever paid except the Croats In Hungary at 
this late stage of the war the Germans were demanding payment in goods  shipments of food to 
the Reich in quantities determined by the amount of food the deported Jews would have 
consumed 
The Weiss affair was only the beginning and things were to get considerably worse from 
Eichmanns point of view Becher was a born businessman and where Eichmann saw only 
enormous tasks of organization and administration he saw almost unlimited possibilities for 
making money The one thing that stood in his way was the narrowmindedness of subordinate 
creatures like Eichmann who took their jobs seriously Obersturmbannfhrer Bechers projects 
soon led him to cooperate closely in the rescue efforts of Dr Rudolf Kastner It was to Kastners 
testimony on his behalf that Becher later at Nuremberg owed his freedom Being an old Zionist 
Kastner had moved to Israel after the war where he held a high position until a journalist 
published a story about his collaboration with the SS  whereupon Kastner sued him for libel His 
testimony at Nuremberg weighed heavily against him and when the case came before the 
Jerusalem District Court Judge Halevi one of the three judges in the Eichmann trial told Kastner 
that he had sold his soul to the devil In March  shortly before his case was to be 
appealed before the Israeli Supreme Court Kastner was murdered none of the murderers it 
seems came from Hungary In the hearing that followed the verdict of the lower court was 
repealed and Kastner was fully rehabilitated The deals Becher made through Kastner were 
much simpler than the complicated negotiations with the business magnates they consisted in 
fixing a price for the life of each Jew to be rescued There was considerable haggling over prices 
and at one point it seems Eichmann also got involved in some of the preliminary discussions 
Characteristically his price was the lowest a mere two hundred dollars per Jew  not of course 
because he wished to save more Jews but simply because he was not used to thinking big The 
price finally arrived at was a thousand dollars and one group consisting of  Jews and 
including Dr Kastners family actually left Hungary for the exchange camp at BergenBelsen 
from which they eventually reached Switzerland A similar deal through which Becher and 
Himmler hoped to obtain twenty million Swiss francs from the American Joint Distribution 
Committee for the purchase of merchandise of all sorts kept everybody busy until the Russians 
liberated Hungary but nothing came of it 
There is no doubt that Bechers activities had the full approval of Himmler and stood in the 
sharpest possible opposition to the old radical orders which still reached Eichmann through 
Mller and Kaltenbrunner his immediate superiors in the RSHA In Eichmanns view people 
like Becher were corrupt but corruption could not very well have caused his crisis of conscience 
for although he was apparently not susceptible to this kind of temptation he must by this time 
have been surrounded by corruption for many years It is difficult to imagine that he did not know 
that his friend and subordinate Hauptsturmfhrer Dieter Wisliceny had as early as  
accepted fifty thousand dollars from the Jewish Relief Committee in Bratislava for delaying the 
deportations from Slovakia though it is not altogether impossible but he cannot have been 
ignorant of the fact that Himmler in the fall of  had tried to sell exit permits to the Slovakian 
Jews in exchange for enough foreign currency to pay for the recruitment of a new SS division 
Now however in  in Hungary it was different not because Himmler was involved in 
business but because business had now become official policy it was no longer mere 
corruption 
At the beginning Eichmann tried to enter the game and play it according to the new rules that 
was when he got involved in the fantastic bloodforwares negotiations  one million Jews for ten 
thousand trucks for the crumbling German Army  which certainly were not initiated by him The 
way he explained his role in this matter in Jerusalem showed clearly how he had once justified it 
to himself as a military necessity that would bring him the additional benefit of an important new 

role in the emigration business What he probably never admitted to himself was that the 
mounting difficulties on all sides made it every day more likely that he would soon be without a 
job indeed this happened a few months later unless he succeeded in finding some foothold 
amid the new jockeying for power that was going on all around him When the exchange project 
met with its predictable failure it was already common knowledge that Himmler despite his 
constant vacillations chiefly due to his justified physical fear of Hitler had decided to put an end 
to the whole Final Solution  regardless of business regardless of military necessity and without 
anything to show for it except the illusions he had concocted about his future role as the bringer 
of peace to Germany It was at this time that a moderate wing of the SS came into existence 
consisting of those who were stupid enough to believe that a murderer who could prove he had 
not killed as many people as he could have killed would have a marvelous alibi and those who 
were clever enough to foresee a return to normal conditions when money and good 
connections would again be of paramount importance 
Eichmann never joined this moderate wing and it is questionable whether he would have been 
admitted if he had tried to Not only was he too deeply compromised and because of his constant 
contact with Jewish functionaries too well known he was too primitive for these welleducated 
uppermiddleclass gentlemen against whom he harbored the most violent resentment up to 
the very end He was quite capable of sending millions of people to their death but he was not 
capable of talking about it in the appropriate manner without being given his language rule In 
Jerusalem without any rules he spoke freely of killing and of murder of crimes legalized by 
the state he called a spade a spade in contrast to counsel for the defense whose feeling of 
social superiority to Eichmann was more than once in evidence Servatius assistant Dr Dieter 
Wechtenbruch  a disciple of Carl Schmitt who attended the first few weeks of the trial then was 
sent to Germany to question witnesses for the defense and reappeared for the last week in 
August  was readily available to reporters out of court he seemed to be shocked less by 
Eichmanns crimes than by his lack of taste and education Small fry he said we must see 
how we get him over the hurdles  wie wir das Wrstchen fiber die Runden bringen Servatius 
himself had declared even prior to the trial that his clients personality was that of a common 
mailman 
When Himmler became moderate Eichmann sabotaged his orders as much as he dared to the 
extent at least that he felt he was covered by his immediate superiors How does Eichmann 
dare to sabotage Himmlers orders  in this case to stop the foot marches in the fall of   
Kastner once asked Wisliceny And the answer was He can probably show some telegram 
Mller and Kaltenbrunner must have covered him It is quite possible that Eichmann had some 
confused plan for liquidating Theresienstadt before the arrival of the Red Army although we know 
this only through the dubious testimony of Dieter Wisliceny who months and perhaps years 
before the end began carefully preparing an alibi for himself at the expense of Eichmann to 
which he then treated the court at Nuremberg where he was a witness for the prosecution it did 
him no good for he was extradited to Czechoslovakia prosecuted and executed in Prague 
where he had no connections and where money was of no help to him Other witnesses claimed 
that it was Rolf Gnther one of Eichmanns men who planned this and that there existed on the 
contrary a written order from Eichmann that the ghetto be left intact In any event there is no 
doubt that even in April  when practically everybody had become quite moderate 
Eichmann took advantage of a visit that M Paul Dunand of the Swiss Red Cross paid to 
Theresienstadt to put it on record that he himself did not approve of Himmlers new line in regard 
to the Jews 
That Eichmann had at all times done his best to make the Final Solution final was therefore not in 
dispute The question was only whether this was indeed proof of his fanaticism his boundless 
hatred of Jews and whether he had lied to the police and committed perjury in court when he 
claimed he had always obeyed orders No other explanation ever occurred to the judges who 
tried so hard to understand the accused and treated him with a consideration and an authentic 
shining humanity such as he had probably never encountered before in his whole life Dr 
Wechtenbruch told reporters that Eichmann had great confidence in Judge Landau as though 
Landau would be able to sort things out and ascribed this confidence to Eichmanns need for 
authority Whatever its basis the confidence was apparent throughout the trial and it may have 
been the reason the judgment caused Eichmann such great disappointment he had mistaken 

humanity for softness That they never did come to understand him may be proof of the 
goodness of the three men of their untroubled and slightly oldfashioned faith in the moral 
foundations of their profession For the sad and very uncomfortable truth of the matter probably 
was that it was not his fanaticism but his very conscience that prompted Eichmann to adopt his 
uncompromising attitude during the last year of the war as it had prompted him to move in the 
opposite direction for a short time three years before Eichmann knew that Himmlers orders ran 
directly counter to the Fhrers order For this he needed to know no factual details though such 
details would have backed him up as the prosecution underlined in the proceedings before the 
Supreme Court when Hitler heard through Kaltenbrunner of negotiations to exchange Jews for 
trucks Himmlers position in Hitlers eyes was completely undermined And only a few weeks 
before Himmler stopped the extermination at Auschwitz Hitler obviously unaware of Himmlers 
newest moves had sent an ultimatum to Horthy telling him he expected that the measures 
against Jews in Budapest would now be taken without any further delay by the Hungarian 
government When Himmlers order to stop the evacuation of Hungarian Jews arrived in 
Budapest Eichmann threatened according to a telegram from Veesenmayer to seek a new 
decision from the Fhrer and this telegram the judgment found more damning than a hundred 
witnesses could be 
Eichmann lost his fight against the moderate wing headed by the Reichsfhrer SS and Chief 
of the German Police The first indication of his defeat came in January  when 
Obersturmbannfhrer Kurt Becher was promoted to Standartenfhrer the very rank Eichmann 
had been dreaming about all during the war His story that no higher rank was open to him in his 
outfit was a halftruth he could have been made chief of Department IVB instead of occupying 
the desk of IVB and would then have been automatically promoted The truth probably was 
that people like Eichmann who had risen from the ranks were never permitted to advance 
beyond a lieutenant colonelcy except at the front That same month Hungary was liberated and 
Eichmann was called back to Berlin There Himmler had appointed his enemy Becher 
Reichssonderkommissar in charge of all concentration camps and Eichmann was transferred 
from the desk concerned with Jewish Affairs to the utterly insignificant one concerned with the 
Fight Against the Churches of which moreover he knew nothing The rapidity of his decline 
during the last months of the war is a most telling sign of the extent to which Hitler was right when 
he declared in his Berlin bunker in April  that the SS were no longer reliable 
 
In Jerusalem confronted with documentary proof of his extraordinary loyalty to Hitler and the 
Fhrers order Eichmann tried a number of times to explain that during the Third Reich the 
Fhrers words had the force of law Fhrerworte haben Gesetzeskraft which meant among 
other things that if the order came directly from Hitler it did not have to be in writing He tried to 
explain that this was why he had never asked for a written order from Hitler no such document 
relating to the Final Solution has ever been found probably it never existed but had demanded 
to see a written order from Himmler To be sure this was a fantastic state of affairs and whole 
libraries of very learned juridical comment have been written all demonstrating that the Fhrers 
words his oral pronouncements were the basic law of the land Within this legal framework 
every order contrary in letter or spirit to a word spoken by Hitler was by definition unlawful 
Eichmanns position therefore showed a most unpleasant resemblance to that of the oftencited 
soldier who acting in a normal legal framework refuses to carry out orders that run counter to his 
ordinary experience of lawfulness and hence can be recognized by him as criminal The 
extensive literature on the subject usually supports its case with the common equivocal meaning 
of the word law which in this context means sometimes the law of the land  that is posited 
positive law  and sometimes the law that supposedly speaks in all mens hearts with an identical 
voice Practically speaking however orders to be disobeyed must be manifestly unlawful and 
unlawfulness must fly like a black flag above them as a warning reading Prohibited   as the 
judgment pointed out And in a criminal regime this black flag with its warning sign flies as 
manifestly above what normally is a lawful order  for instance not to kill innocent people just 
because they happen to be Jews  as it flies above a criminal order under normal circumstances 
To fall back on an unequivocal voice of conscience  or in the even vaguer language of the 
jurists on a general sentiment of humanity OppenheimLauterpacht in International Law  
 not only begs the question it signifies a deliberate refusal to take notice of the central moral 

legal and political phenomena of our century 
To be sure it was not merely Eichmanns conviction that Himmler was now giving criminal 
orders that determined his actions But the personal element undoubtedly involved was not 
fanaticism it was his genuine boundless and immoderate admiration for Hitler as one of the 
defense witnesses called it  for the man who had made it from lance corporal to Chancellor of 
the Reich It would be idle to try to figure out which was stronger in him his admiration for Hitler 
or his determination to remain a lawabiding citizen of the Third Reich when Germany was 
already in ruins Both motives came into play once more during the last days of the war when he 
was in Berlin and saw with violent indignation how everybody around him was sensibly enough 
getting himself fixed up with forged papers before the arrival of the Russians or the Americans A 
few weeks later Eichmann too began to travel under an assumed name but by then Hitler was 
dead and the law of the land was no longer in existence and he as he pointed out was no 
longer bound by his oath For the oath taken by the members of the SS differed from the military 
oath sworn by the soldiers in that it bound them only to Hitler not to Germany 
The case of the conscience of Adolf Eichmann which is admittedly complicated but is by no 
means unique is scarcely comparable to the case of the German generals one of whom when 
asked at Nuremberg How was it possible that all you honorable generals could continue to 
serve a murderer with such unquestioning loyalty replied that it was not the task of a soldier to 
act as judge over his supreme commander Let history do that or God in heaven Thus General 
Alfred Jodl hanged at Nuremberg  Eichmann much less intelligent and without any education to 
speak of at least dimly realized that it was not an order but a law which had turned them all into 
criminals The distinction between an order and the Fhrers word was that the latters validity 
was not limited in time and space which is the outstanding characteristic of the former This is 
also the true reason why the Fhrers order for the Final Solution was followed by a huge shower 
of regulations and directives all drafted by expert lawyers and legal advisers not by mere 
administrators this order in contrast to ordinary orders was treated as a law Needless to add 
the resulting legal paraphernalia far from being a mere symptom of German pedantry or 
thoroughness served most effectively to give the whole business its outward appearance of 
legality 
And just as the law in civilized countries assumes that the voice of conscience tells everybody 
Thou shalt not kill even though mans natural desires and inclinations may at times be 
murderous so the law of Hitlers land demanded that the voice of conscience tell everybody 
Thou shalt kill although the organizers of the massacres knew full well that murder is against 
the normal desires and inclinations of most people Evil in the Third Reich had lost the quality by 
which most people recognize it  the quality of temptation Many Germans and many Nazis 
probably an overwhelming majority of them must have been tempted not to murder not to rob 
not to let their neighbors go off to their doom for that the Jews were transported to their doom 
they knew of course even though many of them may not have known the gruesome details and 
not to become accomplices in all these crimes by benefiting from them But God knows they had 
learned how to resist temptation 
 
 
 
IX  Deportations from the ReichGermany 
 
Austria and the Protectorate 
 
 
 
Between the Wannsee Conference in January  when Eichmann felt like Pontius Pilate and 
washed his hands in innocence and Himmlers orders in the summer and fall of  when 
behind Hitlers back the Final Solution was abandoned as though the massacres had been 
nothing but a regrettable mistake Eichmann was troubled by no questions of conscience His 
thoughts were entirely taken up with the staggering job of organization and administration in the 
midst not only of a world war but more important for him of innumerable intrigues and fights over 
spheres of authority among the various State and Party offices that were busy solving the Jewish 

question His chief competitors were the Higher SS and Police Leaders who were under the 
direct command of Himmler had easy access to him and always outranked Eichmann There 
was also the Foreign Office which under its new Undersecretary of State Dr Martin Luther a 
protege of Ribbentrop had become very active in Jewish affairs Luther tried to oust Ribbentrop 
in an elaborate intrigue in  failed and was put into a concentration camp under his 
successor Legationsrat Eberhard von Thadden a witness for the defense at the trial in 
Jerusalem became Referent in Jewish affairs It occasionally issued deportation orders to be 
carried out by its representatives abroad who for reasons of prestige preferred to work through 
the Higher SS and Police Leaders There were furthermore the Army commanders in the 
Eastern occupied territories who liked to solve problems on the spot which meant shooting the 
military men in Western countries were on the other hand always reluctant to cooperate and to 
lend their troops for the rounding up and seizure of Jews Finally there were the Gauleiters the 
regional leaders each of whom wanted to be the first to declare his territory judenrein and who 
occasionally started deportation procedures on their own 
Eichmann had to coordinate all these efforts to bring some order out of what he described as 
complete chaos in which everyone issued his own orders and did as he pleased And 
indeed he succeeded though never completely in acquiring a key position in the whole process 
because his office organized the means of transportation According to Dr Rudolf Mildner 
Gestapo head in Upper Silesia where Auschwitz was located and later chief of the Security 
Police in Denmark who testified for the prosecution at Nuremberg orders for deportations were 
given by Himmler in writing to Kaltenbrunner head of the RSHA who notified Miller head of 
the Gestapo or Section IV of RSHA who in turn transmitted the orders orally to his referent in 
IVB  that is to Eichmann Himmler also issued orders to the local Higher SS and Police 
Leaders and informed Kaltenbrunner accordingly Questions of what should be done with the 
Jewish deportees how many should be exterminated and how many spared for hard labor were 
also decided by Himmler and his orders concerning these matters went to Pohls WVHA 
which communicated them to Richard Glcks inspector of the concentration and extermination 
camps who in turn passed them along to the commanders of the camps The prosecution 
ignored these documents from the Nuremberg Trials since they contradicted its theory of the 
extraordinary power held by Eichmann the defense mentioned Mildners affidavits but not to 
much purpose Eichmann himself after consulting Poliakoff and Reitlinger produced seventeen 
multicolored charts which contributed little to a better understanding of the intricate bureaucratic 
machinery of the Third Reich although his general description  everything was always in a state 
of continuous flux a steady stream  sounded plausible to the student of totalitarianism who 
knows that the monolithic quality of this form of government is a myth He still remembered 
vaguely how his men his advisers on Jewish matters in all occupied and semiindependent 
countries had reported back to him what action was at all practicable how he had then 
prepared reports which were later either approved or rejected and how Mller then had issued 
his directives in practice this could mean that a proposal that came in from Paris or The Hague 
went out a fortnight later to Paris or The Hague in the form of a directive approved by the 
RSHA Eichmanns position was that of the most important conveyor belt in the whole 
operation because it was always up to him and his men how many Jews could or should be 
transported from any given area and it was through his office that the ultimate destination of the 
shipment was cleared though that destination was not determined by him But the difficulty in 
synchronizing departures and arrivals the endless worry over wrangling enough rolling stock 
from the railroad authorities and the Ministry of Transport over fixing timetables and directing 
trains to centers with sufficient absorptive capacity over having enough Jews on hand at the 
proper time so that no trains would be wasted over enlisting the help of the authorities in 
occupied or allied countries to carry out arrests over following the rules and directives with 
respect to the various categories of Jews which were laid down separately for each country and 
constantly changing  all this became a routine whose details he had forgotten long before he was 
brought to Jerusalem 
What for Hitler the sole lonely plotter of the Final Solution never had a conspiracy if such it 
was needed fewer conspirators and more executors was among the wars main objectives with 
its implementation given top priority regardless of economic and military considerations and 
what for Eichmann was a job with its daily routine its ups and downs was for the Jews quite 

literally the end of the world For hundreds of years they had been used to understanding their 
own history rightly or wrongly as a long story of suffering much as the prosecutor described it in 
his opening speech at the trial but behind this attitude there had been for a long time the 
triumphant conviction of Am Yisrael Chai the people of Israel shall live individual Jews whole 
Jewish families might die in pogroms whole communities might be wiped out but the people 
would survive They had never been confronted with genocide Moreover the old consolation no 
longer worked anyhow at least not in Western Europe Since Roman antiquity that is since the 
inception of European history the Jews had belonged for better or worse in misery or in 
splendor to the European comity of nations but during the past hundred and fifty years it had 
been chiefly for better and the occasions of splendor had become so numerous that in Central 
and Western Europe they were felt to be the rule Hence the confidence that the people would 
eventually survive no longer held great significance for large sections of the Jewish communities 
they could no more imagine Jewish life outside the framework of European civilization than they 
could have pictured to themselves a Europe that was judenrein 
The end of the world though carried through with remarkable monotony took almost as many 
different shapes and appearances as there existed countries in Europe This will come as no 
surprise to the historian familiar with the development of European nations and with the rise of the 
nationstate system but it came as a great surprise to the Nazis who were genuinely convinced 
that antiSemitism could become the common denominator that would unite all Europe This was 
a huge and costly error It quickly turned out that in practice though perhaps not in theory there 
existed great differences among antiSemites in the various countries What was even more 
annoying though it might easily have been predicted was that the German radical variety was 
fully appreciated only by those peoples in the East  the Ukrainians the Estonians the Latvians 
the Lithuanians and to some extent the Rumanians  whom the Nazis had decided to regard as 
subhuman barbarian hordes Notably deficient in proper hostility toward the Jews were the 
Scandinavian nations Knut Hamsun and Sven Hedin were exceptions which according to the 
Nazis were Germanys blood brethren 
The end of the world began of course in the German Reich which at the time embraced not only 
Germany but Austria Moravia and Bohemia the Czech Protectorate and the annexed Polish 
Western Regions In the last of these the socalled Warthegau Jews together with Poles had 
been deported eastward after the beginning of the war in the first huge resettlement project in the 
East an organized wandering of nations as the judgment of the District Court in Jerusalem 
called it  while Poles of German origin Volksdeutsche were shipped westward back into the 
Reich Himmler in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of German 
Folkdom had entrusted Heydrich with this emigration and evacuation and in January  
Eichmanns first official department in the RSHA Bureau IVD was set up Though this 
position proved administratively to be the steppingstone to his later job in Bureau VB 
Eichmanns work here was no more than a kind of apprenticeship the transition between his old 
job of making people emigrate and his future task of deporting them His first deportation jobs did 
not belong to the Final Solution they occurred before the official Hitler order In view of what 
happened later they can be regarded as test cases as an experiment in catastrophe The first 
was the deportation of thirteen hundred Jews from Stettin which was carried out in a single night 
on February   This was the first deportation of German Jews and Heydrich had ordered 
it under the pretext that their apartments were urgently required for reasons connected with the 
war economy They were taken under unusually atrocious conditions to the Lublin area of 
Poland The second deportation took place in the fall of the same year all the Jews in Baden and 
the Saarpfalz  about seventyfive hundred men women and children  were shipped as I 
mentioned earlier to Unoccupied France which was at that moment quite a trick since nothing in 
the FrancoGerman Armistice agreement stipulated that Vichy France could become a dumping 
ground for Jews Eichmann had to accompany the train himself in order to convince the French 
stationmaster at the border that this was a German military transport 
These two operations entirely lacked the later elaborate legal preparations No laws had yet 
been passed depriving Jews of their nationality the moment they were deported from the Reich 
and instead of the many forms Jews eventually had to fill out in arranging for the confiscation of 
their property the Stettin Jews simply signed a general waiver covering everything they owned 
Clearly it was not the administrative apparatus that these first operations were supposed to test 

The objective seems to have been a test of general political conditions  whether Jews could be 
made to walk to their doom on their own feet carrying their own little valises in the middle of the 
night without any previous notification what the reaction of their neighbors would be when they 
discovered the empty apartments in the morning and last but not least in the case of the Jews 
from Baden how a foreign government would react to being suddenly presented with thousands 
of Jewish refugees As far as the Nazis could see everything turned out very satisfactorily In 
Germany there were a number of interventions for special cases  for the poet Alfred Mombert 
for instance a member of the Stefan George circle who was permitted to depart to Switzerland  
but the population at large obviously could not have cared less It was probably at this moment 
that Heydrich realized how important it would be to separate Jews with connections from the 
anonymous masses and decided with Hitlers agreement to establish Theresienstadt and 
BergenBelsen In France something even better happened the Vichy government put all 
seventyfive hundred Jews from Baden in the notorious concentration camp at Gurs at the foot of 
the Pyrenees which had originally been built for the Spanish Republican Army and had been 
used since May of  for the socalled r s provenant dAllemagne the large majority of 
whom were of course Jewish When the Final Solution was put into effect in France the 
inmates of the Gurs camp were all shipped to Auschwitz The Nazis always eager to generalize 
thought they had demonstrated that Jews were undesirables everywhere and that every non
Jew was an actual or potential antiSemite Why then should anybody be bothered if they 
tackled this problem radically Still under the spell of these generalizations Eichmann 
complained over and over in Jerusalem that no country had been ready to accept Jews that this 
and only this had caused the great catastrophe As though those tightly organized European 
nationstates would have reacted any differently if any other group of foreigners had suddenly 
descended upon them in hordes  penniless passportless unable to speak the language of the 
country However to the neverending surprise of the Nazi officials even the convinced anti
Semites in foreign lands were not willing to be consistent and showed a deplorable tendency to 
shy away from radical measures Few of them put it as bluntly as a member of the Spanish 
Embassy in Berlin  If only one could be sure they wouldnt be liquidated he said of some six 
hundred Jews of Spanish descent who had been given Spanish passports though they had 
never been in Spain and whom the Franco Government wished very much to transfer to German 
jurisdiction  but most of them thought precisely along these lines 
After these first experiments there followed a lull in deportations and we have seen how 
Eichmann used his enforced inactivity to play around with Madagascar But in March  
during the preparation for the war against Russia Eichmann was suddenly put in charge of a new 
subsection or rather the name of his subsection was changed from Emigration and Evacuation 
to Jewish Affairs Evacuation From then on though he was not yet informed of the Final Solution 
he should have been aware not only that emigration had definitely come to an end but that 
deportation was to take its place But Eichmann was not a man to take hints and since no one 
had yet told him differently he continued to think in terms of emigration Thus at a meeting with 
representatives of the Foreign Office in October  during which it had been proposed that 
the citizenship of all German Jews abroad be canceled Eichmann protested vigorously that such 
a step might influence other countries which to date were still ready to open their gates to Jewish 
immigrants and to grant entry permits He always thought within the narrow limits of whatever 
laws and decrees were valid at a given moment and the shower of new antiJewish legislation 
descended upon the Reichs Jews only after Hitlers order for the Final Solution had been officially 
handed down to those who were to implement it At the same time it had been decided that the 
Reich was to be given top priority its territories made judenrein with all speed it is surprising that 
it still took almost two years to do the job The preparatory regulations which were soon to serve 
as models for all other countries consisted first of the introduction of the yellow badge 
September   second of a change in the nationality law providing that a Jew could not be 
considered a German national if he lived outside the borders of the Reich whence of course he 
was to be deported third of a decree that all property of German Jews who had lost their 
nationality was to be confiscated by the Reich November   The preparations culminated 
in an agreement between Otto Thierack the Minister of Justice and Himmler whereby the former 
relinquished jurisdiction over Poles Russians Jews and Gypsies in favor of the SS since the 
Ministry of Justice can make only a small contribution to the extermination sic of these peoples 

This open language in a letter dated October  from the Minister of Justice to Martin 
Bormann head of the Party Chancellery is noteworthy Slightly different directives had to be 
issued to cover those who were deported to Theresienstadt because Theresienstadt being on 
Reich territory the Jews deported there did not automatically become stateless In the case of 
these privileged categories an old law of  permitted the government to confiscate property 
that had been used for activities hostile to the nation and the State This kind of confiscation had 
been customary in the case of political prisoners in the concentration camps and though Jews 
did not belong in this category  all concentration camps in Germany and Austria had become 
judenrein by the fall of   it took only one more regulation issued in March  to establish 
that all deported Jews were hostile to the nation and the State The Nazis took their own 
legislation quite seriously and though they talked among themselves of the Theresienstadt 
ghetto or the ghetto for old people Theresienstadt was officially classified as a concentration 
camp and the only people who did not know this  one did not want to hurt their feelings since 
this place of residence was reserved for special cases  were the inmates And to make sure 
that the Jews sent there would not become suspicious the Jewish Association in Berlin the 
Reichsvereinigung was directed to draw up an agreement with each deportee for the acquisition 
of residence in Theresienstadt The candidate transferred all his property to the Jewish 
Association in consideration whereof the Association guaranteed him housing food clothing 
and medical care for life When finally the last officials of the Reichsvereinigung were 
themselves sent to Theresienstadt the Reich simply confiscated the considerable amount of 
money then in the Associations treasury 
All deportations from West to East were organized and coordinated by Eichmann and his 
associates in Section IVB of the RSHA  a fact that was never disputed during the trial But 
to put the Jews on the trains he needed the help of ordinary police units in Germany the Order 
Police guarded the trains and posted escorts and in the East the Security Police not to be 
confused with Himmlers Security Service or SD stood ready at the places of destination to 
receive the trains and hand their inmates over to the authorities in the killing centers The 
Jerusalem court followed the definitions of criminal organizations established at Nuremberg this 
meant that neither the Order Police nor the Security Police were ever mentioned although their 
active involvement in the implementation of the Final Solution had by this time been amply 
substantiated But even if all the police units had been added to the four organizations recognized 
as criminal  the leadership corps of the Nazi Party the Gestapo the SD and the SS  the 
Nuremberg distinctions would have remained inadequate and inapplicable to the reality of the 
Third Reich For the truth of the matter is that there existed not a single organization or public 
institution in Germany at least during the war years that did not become involved in criminal 
actions and transactions 
After the troublesome issue of personal interventions had been resolved through the 
establishment of Theresienstadt two things still stood in the way of a radical and final solution 
One was the problem of halfJews whom the radicals wanted to deport along with the full Jews 
and whom the moderates wished to sterilize  because if you permitted the halfJews to be 
killed it meant that you abandoned that half of their blood which is German as Stuckart of the 
Ministry of the Interior phrased it at the Wannsee Conference Actually nothing was ever done 
about the Mischlinge or about Jews who had made mixed marriages a forest of difficulties in 
Eichmanns words surrounded and protected them  their nonJewish relatives for one and for 
another the disappointing fact that the Nazi physicians despite all their promises never 
discovered a quick means of mass sterilization The second problem was the presence in 
Germany of a few thousand foreign Jews whom Germany could not deprive of their nationality 
through deportation A few hundred American and English Jews were interned and held for 
exchange purposes but the methods devised for dealing with nationals of neutral countries or 
those allied with Germany are interesting enough to be recorded especially since they played a 
certain role in the trial It was in reference to these people that Eichmann was accused of having 
shown inordinate zeal lest a single Jew escape him This zeal he shared as Reitlinger says with 
the professional bureaucrats of the Foreign Office to whom the flight of a few Jews from torture 
and slow death was a matter of the gravest concern and whom he had to consult on all such 
cases As far as Eichmann was concerned the simplest and most logical solution was to deport 
all Jews regardless of their nationality According to the directives of the Wannsee Conference 

which was held in the heyday of Hitlers victories the Final Solution was to be applied to all 
European Jews whose number was estimated at eleven million and such things as nationality or 
the rights of allied or neutral countries with respect to their citizens were not even mentioned But 
since Germany even in the brightest days of the war depended upon local good will and 
cooperation everywhere these little formalities could not be sneezed at It was the task of the 
experienced diplomats of the Foreign Service to find ways out of this particular forest of 
difficulties and the most ingenious of these consisted in the use of foreign Jews in German 
territory to test the general atmosphere in their home countries The method by which this was 
done though simple was somewhat subtle and was certainly quite beyond Eichmanns mental 
grasp and political apprehension This was borne out by the documentary evidence letters that 
his department addressed to the Foreign Office in these matters were signed by Kaltenbrunner or 
Mller The Foreign Office wrote to the authorities in other countries saying that the German 
Reich was in the process of becoming judenrein and that it was therefore imperative that foreign 
Jews be called home if they were not to be included in the antiJewish measures There was 
more in this ultimatum than meets the eye These foreign Jews as a rule either were naturalized 
citizens of their respective countries or worse were in fact stateless but had obtained passports 
by some highly dubious method that worked well enough as long as their bearers stayed abroad 
This was especially true of Latin American countries whose consuls abroad sold passports to 
Jews quite openly the fortunate holders of such passports had every right including some 
consular protection except the right ever to enter their homeland Hence the ultimatum of the 
Foreign Office was aimed at getting foreign governments to agree to the application of the Final 
Solution at least to those Jews who were only nominally their nationals Was it not logical to 
believe that a government that had shown itself unwilling to offer asylum to a few hundred or a 
few thousand Jews who in any case were in no position to establish permanent residence there 
would be unlikely to raise many objections on the day when its whole Jewish population was to 
be expelled and exterminated Perhaps it was logical but it was not reasonable as we shall see 
shortly 
On June   considerably later than Hitler had hoped the Reich  Germany Austria and 
the Protektorat  was declared judenrein There are no definite figures as to how many Jews were 
actually deported from this area but we know that of the two hundred and sixtyfive thousand 
people who according to German statistics were either deported or were eligible for deportation 
by January  very few escaped perhaps a few hundred at the most a few thousand 
succeeded in hiding and surviving the war How easy it was to set the conscience of the Jews 
neighbors at rest is best illustrated by the official explanation of the deportations given in a 
circular issued by the Party Chancellery in the fall of  It is the nature of things that these in 
some respects very difficult problems can be solved in the interests of the permanent security of 
our people only with ruthless toughness   rcksichtsloser Hrte my italics

Ruthless toughness a quality held in the highest esteem by the rulers of the Third Reich is 
frequently characterized in postwar Germany which has developed a veritable genius for 
understatement with respect to her Nazi past as being ungut  lacking goodness  as though 
nothing had been wrong with those endowed with this quality but a deplorable failure to act 
according to the exacting standards of Christian charity In any case men sent by Eichmanns 
office to other countries as advisers on Jewish affairs  to be attached to the regular diplomatic 
missions or to the military staff or to the local command of the Security Police  were all chosen 
because they possessed this virtue to the highest degree In the beginning during the fall and 
winter of  their main job seems to have been to establish satisfactory relations with the 
other German officials in the countries concerned especially with the German embassies in 
nominally independent countries and with the Reich commissioners in occupied territories in 
either case there was perpetual conflict over jurisdiction in Jewish matters 

In June  Eichmann recalled his advisers in France Belgium and Holland in order to lay 
plans for deportations from these countries Himmler had ordered that FRANCE be given top 
priority in combing Europe from West to East partly because of the inherent importance of the 
nation par excellence and partly because the Vichy government had shown a truly amazing 
understanding of the Jewish problem and had introduced on its own initiative a great deal of 
antiJewish legislation it had even established a special Department for Jewish Affairs headed 
first by Xavier Valiant and somewhat later by Darquier de Pellepoix both wellknown anti
Semites As a concession to the French brand of antiSemitism which was intimately connected 
with a strong generally chauvinistic xenophobia in all strata of the population the operation was 
to start with foreign Jews and since in  more than half of Frances foreign Jews were 
stateless  refugees and migrs from Russia Germany Austria Poland Rumania Hungary  
that is from areas that either were under German domination or had passed antiJewish 
legislation before the outbreak of war  it was decided to begin by deporting an estimated hundred 
thousand stateless Jews The total Jewish population of the country was now well over three 
hundred thousand in  before the influx of refugees from Belgium and Holland in the spring 
of  there had been about two hundred and seventy thousand Jews of whom at least a 
hundred and seventy thousand were foreign or foreignborn Fifty thousand each were to be 
evacuated from the Occupied Zone and from Vichy France with all speed This was a 
considerable undertaking which needed not only the agreement of the Vichy government but the 
active help of the French police who were to do the work done in Germany by the Order Police 
At first there were no difficulties whatever since as Pierre Laval Premier under Marshal Ptain 
pointed out these foreign Jews had always been a problem in France so that the French 
government was glad that a change in the German attitude toward them gave France an 
opportunity to get rid of them It must be added that Laval and Ptain thought in terms of these 
Jews being resettled in the East they did not yet know what resettlement meant 
Two incidents in particular attracted the attention of the Jerusalem court both of which occurred 
in the summer of  a few weeks after the operation had started The first concerned a train 
due to leave Bordeaux on July  which had to be canceled because only a hundred and fifty 
stateless Jews could be found in Bordeaux  not enough to fill the train which Eichmann had 
obtained with great difficulty Whether or not Eichmann recognized this as the first indication that 
things might not be quite as easy as everybody felt entitled to believe he became very excited 
telling his subordinates that this was a matter of prestige  not in the eyes of the French but in 
those of the Ministry of Transport which might get wrong ideas about the efficiency of his 
apparatus  and that he would have to consider whether France should not be dropped 
altogether as far as evacuation was concerned if such an incident was repeated In Jerusalem 
this threat was taken very seriously as proof of Eichmanns power if he wished he could drop 
France Actually it was one of Eichmanns ridiculous boasts proof of his driving power but 
hardly evidence of    his status in the eyes of his subordinates except insofar as he had 
plainly threatened them with losing their very cozy war jobs But if the Bordeaux incident was a 
farce the second was the basis for one of the most horrible of the many hairraising stories told at 
Jerusalem This was the story of four thousand children separated from their parents who were 
already on their way to Auschwitz The children had been left behind at the French collection 
point the concentration camp at Drancy and on July  Eichmanns French representative 
Hauptsturmfhrer Theodor Dannecker phoned him to ask what was to be done with them 
Eichmann took ten days to decide then he called Dannecker back to tell him that as soon as 
transports could again be dispatched to the General Government area of Poland transports of 
children could roll Dr Servatius pointed out that the whole incident actually demonstrated that 
the persons affected were determined neither by the accused nor by any members of his office 
But what unfortunately no one mentioned was that Dannecker had informed Eichmann that 
Laval himself had proposed that children under sixteen be included in the deportations this 
meant that the whole gruesome episode was not even the result of superior orders but the 
outcome of an agreement between France and Germany negotiated at the highest level 
During the summer and fall of  twentyseven thousand stateless Jewseighteen thousand 
from Paris and nine thousand from Vichy France  were deported to Auschwitz Then when there 
were about seventy thousand stateless Jews left in all of France the Germans made their first 
mistake Confident that the French had by now become so accustomed to deporting Jews that 

they wouldnt mind they asked for permission to include French Jews also  simply to facilitate 
administrative matters This caused a complete turnabout the French were adamant in their 
refusal to hand over their own Jews to the Germans And Himmler upon being informed of the 
situation  not by Eichmann or his men incidentally but by one of the Higher SS and Police 
Leaders  immediately gave in and promised to spare French Jews But now it was too late The 
first rumors about resettlement had reached France and while French antiSemites and non
antiSemites too would have liked to see foreign Jews settle somewhere else not even the anti
Semites wished to become accomplices in mass murder Hence the French now refused to take 
a step they had eagerly contemplated only a short time before that is to revoke naturalizations 
granted to Jews after  or after  which would have made about fifty thousand more 
Jews eligible for deportation They also started making such endless difficulties with regard to the 
deportation of stateless and other foreign Jews that all the ambitious plans for the evacuation of 
Jews from France did indeed have to be dropped Tens of thousands of stateless persons went 
into hiding while thousands more fled to the Italianoccupied French zone the Cte dAzur 
where Jews were safe whatever their origin or nationality In the summer of  when 
Germany was declared judenrein and the Allies had just landed in Sicily no more than fiftytwo 
thousand Jews certainly less than twenty per cent of the total had been deported and of these 
no more than six thousand possessed French nationality Not even Jewish prisoners of war in the 
German internment camps for the French Army were singled out for special treatment In April 
 two months before the Allies landed in France there were still two hundred and fifty 
thousand Jews in the country and they all survived the war The Nazis it turned out possessed 
neither the manpower nor the will power to remain tough when they met determined opposition 
The truth of the matter was as we shall see that even the members of the Gestapo and the SS 
combined ruthlessness with softness 
At the June  meeting in Berlin the figures set for immediate deportations from Belgium and 
the Netherlands had been rather low probably because of the high figure set for France No more 
than ten thousand Jews from Belgium and fifteen thousand from Holland were to be seized and 
deported in the immediate future In both cases the figures were later significantly enlarged 
probably because of the difficulties encountered in the French operation The situation of 
BELGIUM was peculiar in some respects The country was ruled exclusively by German military 
authorities and the police as a Belgian government report submitted to the court pointed out 
did not have the same influence upon the other German administration services that they 
enjoyed in other places Belgiums governor General Alexander von Falkenhausen was later 
implicated in the July  conspiracy against Hitler Native collaborators were of importance 
only in Flanders the Fascist movement among the Frenchspeaking Walloons headed by 
Degrelle had little influence The Belgian police did not cooperate with the Germans and the 
Belgian railway men could not even be trusted to leave deportation trains alone They contrived to 
leave doors unlocked or to arrange ambushes so that Jews could escape Most peculiar was the 
composition of the Jewish population Before the outbreak of war there were ninety thousand 
Jews of whom about thirty thousand were German Jewish refugees while another fifty thousand 
came from other European countries By the end of  nearly forty thousand Jews had fled the 
country and among the fifty thousand who remained there were at the most five thousand native
born Belgian citizens Moreover among those who had fled were all the more important Jewish 
leaders most of whom had been foreigners anyway so that the Jewish Council did not command 
any authority among native Jews With this lack of understanding on all sides it is not surprising 
that very few Belgian Jews were deported But recently naturalized and stateless Jews  of 
Czech Polish Russian and German origin many of whom had only recently arrived  were 
easily recognizable and most difficult to hide in the small completely industrialized country By 
the end of  fifteen thousand had been shipped to Auschwitz and by the fall of  when 
the Allies liberated the country a total of twentyfive thousand had been killed Eichmann had his 
usual adviser in Belgium but the adviser seems not to have been very active in these 
operations They were carried out finally by the military administration under increased pressure 
from the Foreign Office 
 
As in practically all other countries the deportations from HOLLAND started with stateless Jews 
who in this instance consisted almost entirely of refugees from Germany whom the prewar Dutch 

government had officially declared to be undesirable There were about thirtyfive thousand 
foreign Jews altogether in a total Jewish population of a hundred and forty thousand Unlike 
Belgium Holland was placed under a civil administration and unlike France the country had no 
government of its own since the cabinet together with the royal family had fled to London The 
small nation was utterly at the mercy of the Germans and of the SS Eichmanns adviser in 
Holland was a certain Willi Zpf recently arrested in Germany while the much more efficient 
adviser in France Mr Dannecker is still at large but he apparently had very little to say and 
could hardly do more than keep the Berlin office posted Deportations and everything connected 
with them were handled by the lawyer Erich Rajakowitsch Eichmanns former legal adviser in 
Vienna and Prague who was admitted to the SS upon Eichmanns recommendation He had 
been sent to Holland by Heydrich in April  and was directly responsible not to the RSHA 
in Berlin but to the local head of the Security Service in The Hague Dr Wilhelm Harsten who in 
turn was under the command of the Higher SS and Police Leader Obergruppenfhrer Hans 
Rauter and his assistant in Jewish affairs Ferdinand aus der Fnten Rauter and Fnten were 
condemned to death by a Dutch court Rauter was executed and Fntens sentence allegedly 
after special intervention from Adenauer was commuted to life imprisonment Harsten too was 
brought to trial in Holland sentenced to twelve years imprisonment and released in  
whereupon he entered the civil service of the Bavarian state government The Dutch authorities 
are considering proceedings against Rajakowitsch who seems to live in either Switzerland or 
Italy All these details have become known in the last year through the publication of Dutch 
documents and the report by E Jacob Dutch correspondent for the Basler Nationalzeitung a 
Swiss newspaper The prosecution in Jerusalem partly because it wanted to build up Eichmann 
at all costs and partly because it got genuinely lost in the intricacies of German bureaucracy 
claimed that all these officers had carried out Eichmanns orders But the Higher SS and Police 
Leaders took orders only directly from Himmler and that Rajakowitsch was still taking orders from 
Eichmann at this time is highly unlikely especially in view of what was then going to happen in 
Holland The judgment without engaging in polemics quietly corrected a great number of errors 
made by the prosecution  though probably not all  and showed the constant jockeying for 
position that went on between the RSHA and the Higher SS and Police Leaders and other 
offices  the tenacious eternal everlasting negotiations as Eichmann called them 
Eichmann had been especially upset by the arrangements in Holland because it was clearly 
Himmler himself who was cutting him down to size quite apart from the fact that the zeal of the 
gentlemen in residence created great difficulties for him in the timing of his own transports and 
generally made a mockery of the importance of the coordinating center in Berlin Thus right at 
the beginning twenty thousand instead of fifteen thousand Jews were deported and Eichmanns 
Mr Zpf who was far inferior in rank as well as in position to all others present was almost 
forced to speed up deportations in  Conflicts of jurisdiction in these matters were to plague 
Eichmann at all times and it was in vain that he explained to anybody who would listen that it 
would be contradictory to the order of the Reichsfhrer SS ie Himmler and illogical if at this 
stage other authorities again were to handle the Jewish problem The last clash in Holland came 
in  and this time even Kaltenbrunner tried to intervene for the sake of uniformity In Holland 
Sephardic Jews of Spanish origin had been exempted although Jews of that origin had been 
sent to Auschwitz from Salonika The judgment was in error when it ventured that the RSHA 
had the upper hand in this dispute  for God knows what reasons some three hundred and 
seventy Sephardic Jews remained unmolested in Amsterdam 
The reason Himmler preferred to work in Holland through his Higher SS and Police Leaders was 
simple These men knew their way around the country and the problem posed by the Dutch 
population was by no means an easy one Holland had been the only country in all Europe where 
students went on strike when Jewish professors were dismissed and where a wave of strikes 
broke out in response to the first deportation of Jews to German concentration camps  and that 
deportation in contrast to those to extermination camps was merely a punitive measure taken 
long before the Final Solution had reached Holland The Germans as de Jong points out were 
taught a lesson From now on the persecution was carried out not with the cudgels of the Nazi 
storm troops     but by decrees published in Verordeningenblad   which the Joodsche 
Weekblad was forced to carry Police raids in the streets no longer occurred and there were no 
strikes on the part of the population However the widespread hostility in Holland toward anti

Jewish measures and the relative immunity of the Dutch people to antiSemitism were held in 
check by two factors which eventually proved fatal to the Jews First there existed a very strong 
Nazi movement in Holland which could be trusted to carry out such police measures as seizing 
Jews ferreting out their hiding places and so on second there existed an inordinately strong 
tendency among the native Jews to draw a line between themselves and the new arrivals which 
was probably the result of the very unfriendly attitude of the Dutch government toward refugees 
from Germany and probably also because antiSemitism in Holland just as in France focused 
on foreign Jews This made it relatively easy for the Nazis to form their Jewish Council the 
Joodsche Raad which remained for a long time under the impression that only German and other 
foreign Jews would be victims of the deportations and it also enabled the SS to enlist in 
addition to Dutch police units the help of a Jewish police force The result was a catastrophe 
unparalleled in any Western country it can be compared only with the extinction under vastly 
different and from the beginning completely desperate conditions of Polish Jewry Although in 
contrast with Poland the attitude of the Dutch people permitted a large number of Jews to go into 
hidingtwenty to twentyfive thousand a very high figure for such a small country  yet an 
unusually large number of Jews living underground at least half of them were eventually found 
no doubt through the efforts of professional and occasional informers By July  a hundred 
and thirteen thousand Jews had been deported most of them to Sobibor a camp in the Lublin 
area of Poland by the river Bug where no selections of ablebodied workers ever took place 
Threefourths of all Jews living in Holland were killed about twothirds of these nativeborn Dutch 
Jews The last shipments left in the fall of  when Allied patrols were at the Dutch borders Of 
the ten thousand Jews who survived in hiding about seventyfive per cent were foreigners  a 
percentage that testifies to the unwillingness of Dutch Jews to face reality 
 
At the Wannsee Conference Martin Luther of the Foreign Office warned of great difficulties in 
the Scandinavian countries notably in Norway and Denmark Sweden was never occupied and 
Finland though in the war on the side of the Axis was the one country the Nazis hardly ever 
even approached on the Jewish question This surprising exception of Finland with some two 
thousand Jews may have been due to Hitlers great esteem for the Finns whom perhaps he did 
not want to subject to threats and humiliating blackmail Luther proposed postponing evacuations 
from Scandinavia for the time being and as far as Denmark was concerned this really went 
without saying since the country retained its independent government and was respected as a 
neutral state until the fall of  although it along with Norway had been invaded by the 
German Army in April  There existed no Fascist or Nazi movement in Denmark worth 
mentioning and therefore no collaborators In NORWAY however the Germans had been able 
to find enthusiastic supporters indeed Vidkun Quisling leader of the proNazi and antiSemitic 
Norwegian party gave his name to what later became known as a quisling government The 
bulk of Norways seventeen hundred Jews were stateless refugees from Germany they were 
seized and interned in a few lightning operations in October and November  When 
Eichmanns office ordered their deportation to Auschwitz some of Quislings own men resigned 
their government posts This may not have come as a surprise to Mr Luther and the Foreign 
Office but what was much more serious and certainly totally unexpected was that Sweden 
immediately offered asylum and sometimes even Swedish nationality to all who were 
persecuted Ernst von Weizsacker Undersecretary of State of the Foreign Office who received 
the proposal refused to discuss it but the offer helped nevertheless It is always relatively easy to 
get out of a country illegally whereas it is nearly impossible to enter the place of refuge without 
permission and to dodge the immigration authorities Hence about nine hundred people slightly 
more than half of the small Norwegian community could be smuggled into Sweden 
It was in DENMARK however that the Germans found out how fully justified the Foreign Offices 
apprehensions had been The story of the Danish Jews is sui generis and the behavior of the 
Danish people and their government was unique among all the countries of Europe  whether 
occupied or a partner of the Axis or neutral and truly independent One is tempted to 
recommend the story as required reading in political science for all students who wish to learn 
something about the enormous power potential inherent in nonviolent action and in resistance to 
an opponent possessing vastly superior means of violence To be sure a few other countries in 
Europe lacked proper understanding of the Jewish question and actually a majority of them 

were opposed to radical and final solutions Like Denmark Sweden Italy and Bulgaria proved 
to be nearly immune to antiSemitism but of the three that were in the German sphere of 
influence only the Danes dared speak out on the subject to their German masters Italy and 
Bulgaria sabotaged German orders and indulged in a complicated game of doubledealing and 
doublecrossing saving their Jews by a tour de force of sheer ingenuity but they never contested 
the policy as such That was totally different from what the Danes did When the Germans 
approached them rather cautiously about introducing the yellow badge they were simply told that 
the King would be the first to wear it and the Danish government officials were careful to point 
out that antiJewish measures of any sort would cause their own immediate resignation It was 
decisive in this whole matter that the Germans did not even succeed in introducing the vitally 
important distinction between native Danes of Jewish origin of whom there were about sixtyfour 
hundred and the fourteen hundred German Jewish refugees who had found asylum in the 
country prior to the war and who now had been declared stateless by the German government 
This refusal must have surprised the Germans no end since it appeared so illogical for a 
government to protect people to whom it had categorically denied naturalization and even 
permission to work Legally the prewar situation of refugees in Denmark was not unlike that in 
France except that the general corruption in the Third Republics civil services enabled a few of 
them to obtain naturalization papers through bribes or connections and most refugees in 
France could work illegally without a permit But Denmark like Switzerland was no country pour 
se dbrouiller The Danes however explained to the German officials that because the stateless 
refugees were no longer German citizens the Nazis could not claim them without Danish assent 
This was one of the few cases in which statelessness turned out to be an asset although it was 
of course not statelessness per se that saved the Jews but on the contrary the fact that the 
Danish government had decided to protect them Thus none of the preparatory moves so 
important for the bureaucracy of murder could carried out and operations were postponed until 
the fall of  
 
What happened then was truly amazing compared with what took place in other European 
countries everything went topsyturvy In August   after the German offensive in Russia 
had failed the Afrika Korps had surrendered in Tunisia and the Allies had invaded Italy  the 
Swedish government canceled its  agreement with Germany which had permitted German 
troops the right to pass through the country Thereupon the Danish workers decided that they 
could help a bit in hurrying things up riots broke out in Danish shipyards where the dock workers 
refused to repair German ships and then went on strike The German military commander 
proclaimed a state of emergency and imposed martial law and Himmler thought this was the right 
moment to tackle the Jewish question whose solution was long overdue What he did not 
reckon with was that  quite apart from Danish resistance  the German officials who had been 
living in the country for years were no longer the same Not only did General von Hannecken the 
military commander refuse to put troops at the disposal of the Reich plenipotentiary Dr Werner 
Best the special SS units Einsatzkommandos employed in Denmark very frequently objected 
to the measures they were ordered to carry out by the central agencies  according to Bests 
testimony at Nuremberg And Best himself an old Gestapo man and former legal adviser to 
Heydrich author of a then famous book on the police who had worked for the military 
government in Paris to the entire satisfaction of his superiors could no longer be trusted 
although it is doubtful that Berlin ever learned the extent of his unreliability Still it was clear from 
the beginning that things were not going well and Eichmanns office sent one of its best men to 
Denmark  Rolf Gnther whom no one had ever accused of not possessing the required ruthless 
toughness Gnther made no impression on his colleagues in Copenhagen and now von 
Hannecken refused even to issue a decree requiring all Jews to report for work 
Best went to Berlin and obtained a promise that all Jews from Denmark would be sent to 
Theresienstadt regardless of their category  a very important concession from the Nazis point of 
view The night of October  was set for their seizure and immediate departure  ships were ready 
in the harbor  and since neither the Danes nor the Jews nor the German troops stationed in 
Denmark could be relied on to help police units arrived from Germany for a doortodoor search 
At the last moment Best told them that they were not permitted to break into apartments 
because the Danish police might then interfere and they were not supposed to fight it out with the 

Danes Hence they could seize only those Jews who voluntarily opened their doors They found 
exactly  people out of a total of more than  at home and willing to let them in A few 
days before the date of doom a German shipping agent Georg F Duckwitz having probably 
been tipped off by Best himself had revealed the whole plan to Danish government officials who 
in turn had hurriedly informed the heads of the Jewish community They in marked contrast to 
Jewish leaders in other countries had then communicated the news openly in the synagogues on 
the occasion of the New Year services The Jews had just time enough to leave their apartments 
and go into hiding which was very easy in Denmark because in the words of the judgment all 
sections of the Danish people from the King down to simple citizens stood ready to receive 
them 
They might have remained in hiding until the end of the war if the Danes had not been blessed 
with Sweden as a neighbor It seemed reasonable to ship the Jews to Sweden and this was 
done with the help of the Danish fishing fleet The cost of transportation for people without means 
 about a hundred dollars per person  was paid largely by wealthy Danish citizens and that was 
perhaps the most astounding feat of all since this was a time when Jews were paying for their 
own deportation when the rich among them were paying fortunes for exit permits in Holland 
Slovakia and later in Hungary either by bribing the local authorities or by negotiating legally 
with the SS who accepted only hard currency and sold exit permits in Holland to the tune of 
five or ten thousand dollars per person Even in places where Jews met with genuine sympathy 
and a sincere willingness to help they had to pay for it and the chances poor people had of 
escaping were nil 
It took the better part of October to ferry all the Jews across the five to fifteen miles of water that 
separates Denmark from Sweden The Swedes received  refugees of whom at least  
were of German origin  were halfJews and  were nonJews married to Jews Almost 
half the Danish Jews seem to have remained in the country and survived the war in hiding The 
nonDanish Jews were better off than ever before they all received permission to work The few 
hundred Jews whom the German police had been able to arrest were shipped to Theresienstadt 
They were old or poor people who either had not received the news in time or had not been able 
to comprehend its meaning In the ghetto they enjoyed greater privileges than any other group 
because of the neverending fuss made about them by Danish institutions and private persons 
Fortyeight persons died a figure that was not particularly high in view of the average age of the 
group When everything was over it was the considered opinion of Eichmann that for various 
reasons the action against the Jews in Denmark has been a failure whereas the curious Dr 
Best declared that the objective of the operation was not to seize a great number of Jews but to 
clean Denmark of Jews and this objective has now been achieved 
Politically and psychologically the most interesting aspect of this incident is perhaps the role 
played by the German authorities in Denmark their obvious sabotage of orders from Berlin It is 
the only case we know of in which the Nazis met with open native resistance and the result 
seems to have been that those exposed to it changed their minds They themselves apparently 
no longer looked upon the extermination of a whole people as a matter of course They had met 
resistance based on principle and their toughness had melted like butter in the sun they had 
even been able to show a few timid beginnings of genuine courage That the ideal of toughness 
except perhaps for a few halfdemented brutes was nothing but a myth of selfdeception 
concealing a ruthless desire for conformity at any price was clearly revealed at the Nuremberg 
Trials where the defendants accused and betrayed each other and assured the world that they 
had always been against it or claimed as Eichmann was to do that their best qualities had 
been abused by their superiors In Jerusalem he accused those in power of having abused 
his obedience The subject of a good government is lucky the subject of a bad government is 
unlucky I had no luck The atmosphere had changed and although most of them must have 
known that they were doomed not a single one of them had the guts to defend the Nazi ideology 
Werner Best claimed at Nuremberg that he had played a complicated double role and that it was 
thanks to him that the Danish officials had been warned of the impending catastrophe 
documentary evidence showed on the contrary that he himself had proposed the Danish 
operation in Berlin but he explained that this was all part of the game He was extradited to 
Denmark and there condemned to death but he appealed the sentence with surprising results 
because of new evidence his sentence was commuted to five years in prison from which he 

was released soon afterward He must have been able to prove to the satisfaction of the Danish 
court that he really had done his best 
 
ITALY was Germanys only real ally in Europe treated as an equal and respected as a sovereign 
independent state The alliance presumably rested on the very highest kind of common interest 
binding together two similar if not identical new forms of government and it is true that Mussolini 
had once been greatly admired in German Nazi circles But by the time war broke out and Italy 
after some hesitation joined in the German enterprise this was a thing of the past The Nazis 
knew well enough that they had more in common with Stalins version of Communism than with 
Italian Fascism and Mussolini on his part had neither much confidence in Germany nor much 
admiration for Hitler All this however belonged among the secrets of the higherups especially 
in Germany and the deep decisive differences between the totalitarian and the Fascist forms of 
government were never entirely understood by the world at large Nowhere did they come more 
conspicuously into the open than in the treatment of the Jewish question 
Prior to the Badoglio coup dtat in the summer of  and the German occupation of Rome 
and northern Italy Eichmann and his men were not permitted to be active in the country They 
were however confronted with the Italian way of not solving anything in the Italianoccupied 
areas of France Greece and Yugoslavia because the persecuted Jews kept escaping into these 
zones where they could be sure of temporary asylum On levels much higher than Eichmanns 
Italys sabotage of the Final Solution had assumed serious proportions chiefly because of 
Mussolinis influence on other Fascist governments in Europe   on Ptains in France on 
Horthys in Hungary on Antonescus in Rumania and even on Francos in Spain If Italy could get 
away with not murdering her Jews German satellite countries might try to do the same Thus 
Dome Sztojai the Hungarian Prime Minister whom the Germans had forced upon Horthy always 
wanted to know when it came to antiJewish measures if the same regulations applied to Italy 
Eichmanns chief Gruppenfhrer Mller wrote a long letter on the subject to the Foreign Office 
pointing all this out but the gentlemen of the Foreign Office could not do much about it because 
they always met the same subtly veiled resistance the same promises and the same failures to 
fulfill them The sabotage was all the more infuriating as it was carried out openly in an almost 
mocking manner The promises were given by Mussolini himself or other highranking officials 
and if the generals simply failed to fulfill them Mussolini would make excuses for them on the 
ground of their different intellectual formation Only occasionally would the Nazis be met with a 
flat refusal as when General Roatta declared that it was incompatible with the honor of the 
Italian Army to deliver the Jews from Italianoccupied territory in Yugoslavia to the appropriate 
German authorities 
It could be considerably worse when Italians seemed to be fulfilling their promises One instance 
of this took place after the Allied landing in French North Africa when all of France was occupied 
by the Germans except the Italian Zone in the south where about fifty thousand Jews had found 
safety Under considerable German pressure an Italian Commissariat for Jewish Affairs was 
established whose sole function was to register all Jews in this region and expel them from the 
Mediterranean coast Twentytwo thousand Jews were indeed seized and removed to the interior 
of the Italian Zone with the result according to Reitlinger that a thousand Jews of the poorest 
class were living in the best hotels of Isre and Savoie Eichmann thereupon sent Alois Brunner 
one of his toughest men down to Nice and Marseilles but by the time he arrived the French 
police had destroyed all the lists of the registered Jews In the fall of  when Italy declared 
war on Germany the German army could finally move into Nice and Eichmann himself hastened 
to the Cte dAzur There he was told  and believed  that between ten and fifteen thousand 
Jews were living in hiding in Monaco that tiny principality with some twentyfive thousand 
residents altogether whose territory the New York Times Magazine noted could fit comfortably 
inside Central Park which caused the RSHA to start a kind of research program It sounds 
like a typically Italian joke The Jews in any event were no longer there they had fled to Italy 
proper and those who were still hiding in the surrounding mountains found their way to 
Switzerland or to Spain The same thing happened when the Italians had to abandon their zone in 
Yugoslavia the Jews left with the Italian Army and found refuge in Fiume 
An element of farce had never been lacking even in Italys most serious efforts to adjust to its 
powerful friend and ally When Mussolini under German pressure introduced antiJewish 

legislation in the late thirties he stipulated the usual exemptions  war veterans Jews with high 
decorations and the like  but he added one more category namely former members of the 
Fascist Party together with their parents and grandparents their wives and children and 
grandchildren I know of no statistics relating to this matter but the result must have been that the 
great majority of Italian Jews were exempted There can hardly have been a Jewish family 
without at least one member in the Fascist Party for this happened at a time when Jews like 
other Italians had been flocking for almost twenty years into the Fascist movement since 
positions in the Civil Service were open only to members And the few Jews who had objected to 
Fascism on principle Socialists and Communists chiefly were no longer in the country Even 
convinced Italian antiSemites seemed unable to take the thing seriously and Roberto Farinacci 
head of the Italian antiSemitic movement had a Jewish secretary in his employ To be sure 
such things had happened in Germany too Eichmann mentioned and there is no reason not to 
believe him that there were Jews even among ordinary SS men but the Jewish origin of people 
like Heydrich Milch and others was a highly confidential matter known only to a handful of 
people whereas in Italy these things were done openly and as it were innocently The key to the 
riddle was of course that Italy actually was one of the few countries in Europe where all anti
Jewish measures were decidedly unpopular since in the words of Ciano they raised a problem 
which fortunately did not exist 
Assimilation that much abused word was a sober fact in Italy which had a community of not 
more than fifty thousand native Jews whose history reached back into the centuries of the 
Roman Empire It was not an ideology something one was supposed to believe in as in all 
Germanspeaking countries or a myth and an obvious selfdeception as notably in France 
Italian Fascism not to be outdone in ruthless toughness had tried to rid the country of foreign 
and stateless Jews prior to the outbreak of the war This had never been much of a success 
because of the general unwillingness of the minor Italian officials to get tough and when things 
had become a matter of life and death they refused under the pretext of maintaining their 
sovereignty to abandon this part of their Jewish population they put them instead into Italian 
camps where they were quite safe until the Germans occupied the country This conduct can 
hardly be explained by objective conditions alone  the absence of a Jewish question  for these 
foreigners naturally created a problem in Italy as they did in every European nationstate based 
upon the ethnic and cultural homogeneity of its population What in Denmark was the result of an 
authentically political sense an inbred comprehension of the requirements and responsibilities of 
citizenship and independence  for the Danes    the Jewish question was a political and not a 
humanitarian question Leni Yahil  was in Italy the outcome of the almost automatic general 
humanity of an old and civilized people 
Italian humanity moreover withstood the test of the terror that descended upon the people during 
the last year and a half of the war In December  the German Foreign Office addressed a 
formal request for help to Eichmanns boss Mller In view of the lack of zeal shown over the last 
months by Italian officials in the implementation of antiJewish measures recommended by the 
Duce we of the Foreign Office deem it urgent and necessary that the implementation    be 
supervised by German officials Whereupon famous Jewkillers from Poland such as Odilo 
Globocnik from the death camps in the Lublin area were dispatched to Italy even the head of the 
military administration was not an Army man but a former governor of Polish Galicia 
Gruppenfhrer Otto Wchter This put an end to practical jokes Eichmanns office sent out a 
circular advising its branches that Jews of Italian nationality would at once become subject to 
the necessary measures and the first blow was to fall upon eight thousand Jews in Rome who 
were to be arrested by German police regiments since the Italian police were not reliable They 
were warned in time frequently by old Fascists and seven thousand escaped The Germans 
yielding as usual when they met resistance now agreed that Italian Jews even if they did not 
belong to exempted categories should not be subject to deportation but should merely be 
concentrated in Italian camps this solution should be final enough for Italy Approximately 
thirtyfive thousand Jews in northern Italy were caught and put into concentration camps near the 
Austrian border In the spring of  when the Red Army had occupied Rumania and the Allies 
were about to enter Rome the Germans broke their promise and began shipping Jews from Italy 
to Auschwitz  about seventyfive hundred people of whom no more than six hundred returned 
Still this came to considerably less than ten per cent of all Jews then living in Italy

To those who followed the case for the prosecution and read the judgment which reorganized its 
confused and confusing general picture it came as a surprise that the line sharply 
distinguishing the Nazicontrolled territories to the east and southeast from the system of nation
states in Central and Western Europe was never mentioned The belt of mixed population that 
stretches from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Adriatic in the south the whole area most of 
which today lies behind the Iron Curtain then consisted of the socalled Successor States 
established by the victorious powers after the First World War A new political order was granted 
to the numerous ethnic groups that had lived for centuries under the domination of empires  the 
Russian Empire in the north the AustroHungarian Empire in the south and the Turkish Empire 
in the southeast Of the nationstates that resulted none possessed anything even approaching 
the ethnic homogeneity of the old European nations that had served as models for their political 
constitutions The result was that each of these countries contained large ethnic groups that were 
violently hostile to the ruling government because their own national aspirations had been 
frustrated in favor of their only slightly more numerous neighbors If any proof of the political 
instability of these recently founded states had been needed the case of Czechoslovakia amply 
provided it When Hitler marched into Prague in March  he was enthusiastically welcomed 
not only by the Sudetendeutschen the German minority but also by the Slovaks whom he 
liberated by offering them an independent state Exactly the same thing happened later in 
Yugoslavia where the Serbian majority the former rulers of the country was treated as the 
enemy and the Croatian minority was given its own national government Moreover because the 
populations in these regions fluctuated there existed no natural or historical boundaries and 
those that had been established by the Treaties of Trianon and St Germain were quite arbitrary 
Hence Hungary Rumania and Bulgaria could be won as Axis partners by generous 
enlargements of their territories and the Jews in these newly annexed areas were always denied 
the status of nationals they automatically became stateless and therefore suffered the same fate 
as the refugees in Western Europe  they were invariably the first to be deported and liquidated 
What also came crashing down during these years was the elaborate system of minority treaties 
whereby the Allies had vainly hoped to solve a problem that within the political framework of the 
nationstate is insoluble The Jews were an officially recognized minority in all Successor States 
and this status had not been forced upon them but had been the outcome of claims entered and 
negotiations conducted by their own delegates to the Versailles Peace Conference This had 
marked an important turning point in Jewish history because it was the first time that Western or 
assimilated Jews had not been recognized as the spokesmen for the whole Jewish people To 
the surprise and also sometimes to the dismay of the Westerneducated Jewish notables it 
had turned out that the large majority of the people desired some sort of social and cultural 
though not political autonomy Legally the status of the Eastern European Jews was just like that 
of any other minority but politically  and this was to be decisive  they were the only ethnic group 
in the region without a homeland that is without a territory in which they formed the majority of 
the population Still they did not live in the same kind of dispersion as their brethren in Western 
and Central Europe and whereas there prior to Hitler it had been a sign of antiSemitism to call 
a Jew a Jew Eastern European Jews were recognized by friend and foe alike as a distinct 
people This was of great consequence for the status of those Jews in the East who were 
assimilated making it utterly different from that in the West where assimilation in one form or 
another had been the rule The great body of middleclass Jews so characteristic of Western and 
Central Europe did not exist in the East in its stead we find a thin layer of uppermiddleclass 
families who actually belonged to the ruling classes and the degree of whose assimilation  
through money through baptism through intermarriage  to Gentile society was infinitely greater 
than that of most Jews in the West 
Among the first countries in which the executors of the Final Solution were confronted with these 

conditions was the puppet state of CROATIA in Yugoslavia whose capital was Zagreb The 
Croat government headed by Dr Ante Pavelic very obligingly introduced antiJewish legislation 
three weeks after its establishment and when asked what was to be done with the few dozen 
Croat Jews in Germany it sent word that they would appreciate deportation to the East The 
Reich Minister of the Interior demanded that the country be judenrein by February  and 
Eichmann sent Hauptsturmfhrer Franz Abromeit to work with the German police attach in 
Zagreb The deportations were carried out by the Croats themselves notably by members of the 
strong Fascist movement the Ustashe and the Croats paid the Nazis thirty marks for each Jew 
deported In exchange they received all the property of the deportees This was in accordance 
with the Germans official territorial principle applicable to all European countries whereby the 
state inherited the property of every murdered Jew who had resided within its boundaries 
regardless of his nationality The Nazis did not by any means always respect the territorial 
principle there were many ways to get around it if it seemed worth the trouble German 
businessmen could buy directly from the Jews before they were deported and the Einsatzstab 
Rosenberg initially empowered to confiscate all Hebraica and Judaica for German antiSemitic 
research centers soon enlarged its activities to include valuable furnishings and art works The 
original deadline of February  could not be met because Jews were able to escape from 
Croatia to Italianoccupied territory but after the Badoglio coup Hermann Krumey another of 
Eichmanns men arrived in Zagreb and by the fall of  thirty thousand Jews had been 
deported to the killing centers 
Only then did the Germans realize that the country was still not judenrein In the initial antiJewish 
legislation they had noted a curious paragraph that transformed into honorary Aryans all Jews 
who made contributions to the Croat cause The number of these Jews had of course greatly 
increased during the intervening years The very rich in other words who parted voluntarily with 
their property were exempted Even more interesting was the fact that the SS Intelligence 
service under Sturmbannfhrer Wilhelm Httl who was first called as a defense witness in 
Jerusalem but whose affidavit was then used by the prosecution had discovered that nearly all 
members of the ruling clique in Croatia from the head of the government to the leader of the 
Ustashe were married to Jewish women The fifteen hundred survivors among the Jews in this 
areafive per cent according to a Yugoslav government report  were clearly all members of this 
highly assimilated and extraordinarily rich Jewish group And since the percentage of 
assimilated Jews among the masses in the East has often been estimated at about five per cent 
it is tempting to conclude that assimilation in the East when it was at all possible offered a much 
better chance for survival than it did in the rest of Europe 
 
Matters were very different in the adjoining territory of SERBIA where the German occupation 
army almost from its first day there had to contend with a kind of partisan warfare that can be 
compared only with what went on in Russia behind the front I mentioned earlier the single 
incident that connected Eichmann with the liquidation of Jews in Serbia The judgment admitted 
that the ordinary lines of command in dealing with the Jews of Serbia did not become quite clear 
to us and the explanation is that Eichmanns office was not involved at all in that area because 
no Jews were deported The problem was all taken care of on the spot On the pretext of 
executing hostages taken in partisan warfare the Army killed the male Jewish population by 
shooting women and children were handed over to the commander of the Security Police a 
certain Dr Emanuel Schfer a special protg of Heydrich who killed them in gas vans In 
August  Staatsrat Harald Turner head of the civilian branch of the military government 
reported proudly that Serbia was the only country in which the problems of both Jews and 
Gypsies were solved and returned the gas vans to Berlin An estimated five thousand Jews 
joined the partisans and this was the only avenue of escape 
Schfer had to stand trial in a German criminal court after the war For the gassing of  
women and children he was sentenced to six years and six months in prison The military 
governor of the region General Franz Bhme committed suicide but Staatsrat Turner was 
handed over to the Yugoslav government and condemned to death It is the same story repeated 
over and over again those who escaped the Nuremberg Trials and were not extradited to the 
countries where they had committed their crimes either were never brought to justice or found in 
the German courts the greatest possible understanding One is unhappily reminded of the 

Weimar Republic whose specialty it was to condone political murder if the killer belonged to one 
of the violently antirepublican groups of the Right 
 
BULGARIA had more cause than any other of the Balkan countries to be grateful to Nazi 
Germany because of the considerable territorial aggrandizement she received at the expense of 
Rumania Yugoslavia and Greece And yet Bulgaria was not grateful neither her government nor 
her people were soft enough to make a policy of ruthless toughness workable This showed not 
only on the Jewish question The Bulgarian monarchy had no reason to be worried about the 
native Fascist movement the Ratnizi because it was numerically small and politically without 
influence and the Parliament remained a highly respected body which worked smoothly with the 
King Hence they dared refuse to declare war on Russia and never even sent a token 
expeditionary force of volunteers to the Eastern front But most surprising of all in the belt of 
mixed populations where antiSemitism was rampant among all ethnic groups and had become 
official governmental policy long before Hitlers arrival the Bulgarians had no understanding of 
the Jewish problem whatever It is true that the Bulgarian Army had agreed to have all the Jews  
they numbered about fifteen thousand  deported from the newly annexed territories which were 
under military government and whose population was antiSemitic but it is doubtful that they 
knew what resettlement in the East actually signified Somewhat earlier in January  the 
government had also agreed to introduce some antiJewish legislation but that from the Nazi 
viewpoint was simply ridiculous some six thousand ablebodied men were mobilized for work all 
baptized Jews regardless of the date of their conversion were exempted with the result that an 
epidemic of conversions broke out five thousand more Jews  out of a total of approximately fifty 
thousand  received special privileges and for Jewish physicians and businessmen a numerus 
clausus was introduced that was rather high since it was based on the percentage of Jews in the 
cities rather than in the country at large When these measures had been put into effect 
Bulgarian government officials declared publicly that things were now stabilized to everybodys 
satisfaction Clearly the Nazis would not only have to enlighten them about the requirements for 
a solution of the Jewish problem but also to teach them that legal stability and a totalitarian 
movement could not be reconciled 
The German authorities must have had some suspicion of the difficulties that lay ahead In 
January  Eichmann wrote a letter to the Foreign Office in which he declared that sufficient 
possibilities exist for the reception of Jews from Bulgaria he proposed that the Bulgarian 
government be approached and assured the Foreign Office that the police attach in Sofia would 
take care of the technical implementation of the deportation This police attach seems not to 
have been very enthusiastic about his work either for shortly thereafter Eichmann sent one of his 
own men Theodor Dannecker from Paris to Sofia as adviser It is quite interesting to note that 
this letter ran directly contrary to the notification Eichmann had sent to Serbia only a few months 
earlier stating that no facilities for the reception of Jews were yet available and that even Jews 
from the Reich could not be deported The high priority given to the task of making Bulgaria 
judenrein can be explained only by Berlins having received accurate information that great speed 
was necessary then in order to achieve anything at all Well the Bulgarians were approached by 
the German embassy but not until about six months later did they take the first step in the 
direction of radical measures  the introduction of the Jewish badge For the Nazis even this 
turned out to be a great disappointment In the first place as they dutifully reported the badge 
was only a very little star second most Jews simply did not wear it and third those who did 
wear it received so many manifestations of sympathy from the misled population that they 
actually are proud of their sign  as Walter Schellenberg Chief of Counterintelligence in the 
RSHA wrote in an SD report transmitted to the Foreign Office in November  
Whereupon the Bulgarian government revoked the decree Under great German pressure the 
Bulgarian government finally decided to expel all Jews from Sofia to rural areas but this measure 
was definitely not what the Germans demanded since it dispersed the Jews instead of 
concentrating them 
This expulsion actually marked an important turning point in the whole situation because the 
population of Sofia tried to stop Jews from going to the railroad station and subsequently 
demonstrated before the Kings palace The Germans were under the illusion that King Boris was 
primarily responsible for keeping Bulgarias Jews safe and it is reasonably certain that German 

Intelligence agents murdered him But neither the death of the monarch nor the arrival of 
Dannecker early in  changed the situation in the slightest because both Parliament and the 
population remained clearly on the side of the Jews Dannecker succeeded in arriving at an 
agreement with the Bulgarian Commissar for Jewish Affairs to deport six thousand leading Jews 
to Treblinka but none of these Jews ever left the country The agreement itself is noteworthy 
because it shows that the Nazis had no hope of enlisting the Jewish leadership for their own 
purposes The Chief Rabbi of Sofia was unavailable having been hidden by Metropolitan 
Stephan of Sofia who had declared publicly that God had determined the Jewish fate and men 
had no right to torture Jews and to persecute them Hilberg  which was considerably more 
than the Vatican had ever done Finally the same thing happened in Bulgaria as was to happen 
in Denmark a few months later  the local German officials became unsure of themselves and 
were no longer reliable This was true of both the police attach a member of the SS who was 
supposed to round up and arrest the Jews and the German Ambassador in Sofia Adolf 
Beckerle who in June  had advised the Foreign Office that the situation was hopeless 
because the Bulgarians had lived for too long with peoples like Armenians Greeks and Gypsies 
to appreciate the Jewish problem  which of course was sheer nonsense since the same could 
be said mutatis mutandis for all countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe It was Beckerle 
too who informed the RSHA in a clearly irritated tone that nothing more could be done And 
the result was that not a single Bulgarian Jew had been deported or had died an unnatural death 
when in August  with the approach of the Red Army the antiJewish laws were revoked 
I know of no attempt to explain the conduct of the Bulgarian people which is unique in the belt of 
mixed populations But one is reminded of Georgi Dimitrov a Bulgarian Communist who 
happened to be in Germany when the Nazis came to power and whom they chose to accuse of 
the Reichstagsbrand the mysterious fire in the Berlin Parliament of February   He was 
tried by the German Supreme Court and confronted with Gring whom he questioned as though 
he were in charge of the proceedings and it was thanks to him that all those accused except van 
der Lubbe had to be acquitted His conduct was such that it won him the admiration of the whole 
world Germany not excluded There is one man left in Germany people used to say and he is 
a Bulgarian 
 
GREECE being occupied in the north by the Germans and in the south by the Italians offered no 
special problems and could therefore be left waiting her turn to become judenrein In February 
 two of Eichmanns specialists Hauptsturmfhrers Dieter Wisliceny and Alois Brunner 
arrived to prepare everything for the deportation of the Jews from Salonika where twothirds of 
Greek Jewry approximately fiftyfive thousand people were concentrated This was according to 
plan within the framework of the Final Solution of the Jewish problem in Europe as their letter of 
appointment from IVB had it Working closely with a certain Kriegsverwaltungsrat Dr Max 
Merten who represented the military government of the region they immediately set up the usual 
Jewish Council with Chief Rabbi Koretz at its head Wisliceny who headed the 
Sonderkommando fr Judenangelegenheiten in Salonika introduced the yellow badge and 
promptly made it known that no exemptions would be tolerated Dr Merten moved the whole 
Jewish population into a ghetto from which they could easily be removed since it was near the 
railroad station The only privileged categories were Jews with foreign passports and as usual 
the personnel of the Judenrat  not more than a few hundred persons all told who were 
eventually shipped to the exchange camp of BergenBelsen There was no avenue of escape 
except flight to the south where the Italians as elsewhere refused to hand Jews over to the 
Germans and the safety in the Italian Zone was shortlived The Greek population was indifferent 
at best and even some of the partisan groups looked upon the operations with approval Within 
two months the whole community had been deported trains for Auschwitz leaving almost daily 
carrying from two thousand to twentyfive hundred Jews each in freight cars In the fall of the 
same year when the Italian Army had collapsed evacuation of some thirteen thousand Jews 
from the southern part of Greece including Athens and the Greek islands was swiftly completed 
In Auschwitz many Greek Jews were employed in the socalled death commandos which 
operated the gas chambers and the crematoria and they were still alive in  when the 
Hungarian Jews were exterminated and the Ldz ghetto was liquidated At the end of that 
summer when rumor had it that the gassing would soon be terminated and the installations 

dismantled one of the very few revolts in any of the camps broke out the death commandos 
were certain that now they too would be killed The revolt was a complete disaster  only one 
survivor remained to tell the story 
It would seem that the indifference of the Greeks to the fate of their Jews has somehow survived 
their liberation Dr Merten a witness for the defense in Eichmanns trial today somewhat 
inconsistently claims both to have known nothing and to have saved the Jews from the fate of 
which he was ignorant He quietly returned to Greece after the war as a representative of a travel 
agency he was arrested but was soon released and allowed to return to Germany His case is 
perhaps unique since trials for war crimes in countries other than Germany have always resulted 
in severe punishment And his testimony for the defense which he gave in Berlin in the presence 
of representatives of both the defense and the prosecution was certainly unique He claimed that 
Eichmann had been very helpful in an attempt to save some twenty thousand women and 
children in Salonika and that all the evil had come from Wisliceny However he eventually stated 
that before testifying he had been approached by Eichmanns brother a lawyer in Linz and by a 
German organization of former members of the SS Eichmann himself denied everything  he 
had never been in Salonika and he had never seen the helpful Dr Merten 
 
Eichmann claimed more than once that his organizational gifts the coordination of evacuations 
and deportations achieved by his office had in fact helped his victims it had made their fate 
easier If this thing had to be done at all he argued it was better that it be done in good order 
During the trial no one not even counsel for the defense paid any attention to this claim which 
was obviously in the same category as his foolish and stubborn contention that he had saved the 
lives of hundreds of thousands of Jews through forced emigration And yet in the light of what 
took place in RUMANIA one begins to wonder Here too everything was topsyturvy but not as 
in Denmark where even the men of the Gestapo began sabotaging orders from Berlin in 
Rumania even the SS were taken aback and occasionally frightened by the horrors of old
fashioned spontaneous pogroms on a gigantic scale they often intervened to save Jews from 
sheer butchery so that the killing could be done in what according to them was a civilized way 
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that Rumania was the most antiSemitic country in prewar 
Europe Even in the nineteenth century Rumanian antiSemitism was a wellestablished fact in 
 the great powers had tried to intervene through the Treaty of Berlin and to get the 
Rumanian government to recognize its Jewish inhabitants as Rumanian nationals  though they 
would have remained secondclass citizens They did not succeed and at the end of the First 
World War all Rumanian Jews  with the exception of a few hundred Sephardic families and some 
Jews of German origin  were still resident aliens It took the whole might of the Allies during the 
peacetreaty negotiations to persuade the Rumanian government to accept a minority treaty 
and to grant the Jewish minority citizenship This concession to world opinion was withdrawn in 
 and  when trusting in the power of Hitler Germany the Rumanians felt they could risk 
denouncing the minority treaties as an imposition upon their sovereignty and could deprive 
several hundred thousand Jews roughly a quarter of the total Jewish population of their 
citizenship Two years later in August  some months prior to Rumanias entry into the war 
on the side of Hitler Germany Marshal Ion Antonescu head of the new Iron Guard dictatorship 
declared all Rumanian Jews to be stateless with the exception of the few hundred families who 
had been Rumanian citizens before the peace treaties That same month he also instituted anti
Jewish legislation that was the severest in Europe Germany not excluded The privileged 
categories war veterans and Jews who had been Rumanians prior to  comprised no more 
than ten thousand people hardly more than one per cent of the whole group Hitler himself was 
aware that Germany was in danger of being outdone by Rumania and he complained to 
Goebbels in August  a few weeks after he had given the order for the Final Solution that a 
man like Antonescu proceeds in these matters in a far more radical fashion than we have done 
up to the present 
Rumania entered the war in February  and the Rumanian Legion became a military force to 
be reckoned with in the coming invasion of Russia In Odessa alone Rumanian soldiers were 
responsible for the massacre of sixty thousand people In contrast to the governments of other 
Balkan countries the Rumanian government had very exact information from the very beginning 
about the massacres of Jews in the East and Rumanian soldiers even after the Iron Guard had 

been ousted from the government in the summer of  embarked upon a program of 
massacres and deportations that even dwarfed the Bucharest outburst of the Iron Guard in 
January of the same year  a program that for sheer horror is unparalleled in the whole atrocity
stricken record Hilberg Deportation Rumanian style consisted in herding five thousand people 
into freight cars and letting them die there of suffocation while the train traveled through the 
countryside without plan or aim for days on end a favorite followup to these killing operations 
was to expose the corpses in Jewish butcher shops Also the horrors of Rumanian concentration 
camps which were established and run by the Rumanians themselves because deportation to 
the East was not feasible were more elaborate and more atrocious than anything we know of in 
Germany When Eichmann sent the customary adviser on Jewish affairs Hauptsturmfhrer 
Gustav Richter to Bucharest Richter reported that Antonescu now wished to ship a hundred and 
ten thousand Jews into two forests across the river Bug that is into Germanheld Russian 
territory for liquidation The Germans were horrified and everybody intervened the Army 
commanders Rosenbergs Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories the Foreign Office in Berlin 
the Minister to Bucharest Freiherr Manfred von Killinger  the last a former high SA officer a 
personal friend of Rhms and therefore suspect in the eyes of the SS was probably spied upon 
by Richter who advised him on Jewish affairs On this matter however they were all in 
agreement Eichmann himself implored the Foreign Office in a letter dated April  to stop 
these unorganized and premature Rumanian efforts to get rid of the Jews at this stage the 
Rumanians must be made to understand that the evacuation of German Jews which is already 
in full swing had priority and he concluded by threatening to bring the Security Police into 
action 
However reluctant the Germans were to give Rumania a higher priority in the Final Solution that 
had originally been planned for any Balkan country they had to come around if they did not want 
the situation to deteriorate into bloody chaos and much as Eichmann may have enjoyed his 
threat to use the Security Police the saving of Jews was not exactly what they had been trained 
for Hence in the middle of August  by which time the Rumanians had killed close to three 
hundred thousand of their Jews mostly without any German help  the Foreign Office concluded 
an agreement with Antonescu for the evacuation of Jews from Rumania to be carried out by 
German units and Eichmann began negotiations with the German railroads for enough cars to 
transport two hundred thousand Jews to the Lublin death camps But now when everything was 
ready and these great concessions had been granted the Rumanians suddenly did an about
face Like a bolt from the blue a letter arrived in Berlin from the trusted Mr RichterMarshal 
Antonescu had changed his mind as Ambassador Killinger reported the Marshal now wanted to 
get rid of Jews in a comfortable manner What the Germans had not taken into account was that 
this was not only a country with an inordinately high percentage of plain murderers but that 
Rumania was also the most corrupt country in the Balkans Side by side with the massacres 
there had sprung up a flourishing business in exemption sales in which every branch of the 
bureaucracy national or municipal had happily engaged The governments own specialty was 
huge taxes which were levied haphazardly upon certain groups or whole communities of Jews 
Now it had discovered that one could sell Jews abroad for hard currency so the Rumanians 
became the most fervent adherents of Jewish emigration  at thirteen hundred dollars a head 
This is how Rumania came to be one of the few outlets for Jewish emigration to Palestine during 
the war And as the Red Army drew nearer Antonescu became even more moderate he now 
was willing to let Jews go without any compensation 
It is a curious fact that Antonescu from beginning to end was not more radical than the Nazis 
as Hitler thought but simply always a step ahead of German developments He had been the 
first to deprive all Jews of nationality and he had started largescale massacres openly and 
unashamedly at a time when the Nazis were still busy trying out their first experiments He had hit 
upon the sales idea more than a year before Himmler offered blood for trucks and he ended as 
Himmler finally did by calling the whole thing off as though it had been a joke In August  
Rumania surrendered to the Red Army and Eichmann specialist in evacuation was sent pell
mell to the area in order to save some ethnic Germans without success About half of 
Rumanias eight hundred and fifty thousand Jews survived a great number of whom  several 
hundred thousand  found their way to Israel Nobody knows how many Jews are left in the 
country today The Rumanian murderers were all duly executed and Killinger committed suicide 

before the Russians could lay their hands on him only Hauptsturmfhrer aD Richter who it is 
true had never had a chance to get into the act lived peacefully in Germany until  when he 
became a belated victim of the Eichmann trial 
 
 
 
XII  Deportations from Central Europe 
Hungary and Slovakia 
 
 
HUNGARY mentioned earlier in connection with the troublesome question of Eichmanns 
conscience was constitutionally a kingdom without a king The country though without access to 
the sea and possessing neither navy nor merchant fleet was ruled  or rather held in trust for the 
nonexistent king  by an admiral Regent or Reichsverweser Nikolaus von Horthy The only visible 
sign of royalty was an abundance of Hofrte councilors to the nonexistent court Once upon a 
time the Holy Roman Emperor had been King of Hungary and more recently after  the 
kaiserlichknigliche Monarchie on the Danube had been precariously held together by the 
Hapsburgs who were emperors Kaiser of Austria and kings of Hungary In  the Hapsburg 
Empire had been dissolved into Successor States and Austria was now a republic hoping for 
Anschluss for union with Germany Otto von Hapsburg was in exile and he would never have 
been accepted as King of Hungary by the fiercely nationalistic Magyars an authentically 
Hungarian royalty on the other hand did not even exist as a historical memory So what Hungary 
was in terms of recognized forms of government only Admiral Horthy knew 
Behind the delusions of royal grandeur was an inherited feudal structure with greater misery 
among the landless peasants and greater luxury among the few aristocratic families who literally 
owned the country than anywhere else in these povertystricken territories the homeland of 
Europes stepchildren It was this background of unsolved social questions and general 
backwardness that gave Budapest society its specific flavor as though Hungarians were a group 
of illusionists who had fed so long on selfdeception that they had lost any sense of incongruity 
Early in the thirties under the influence of Italian Fascism they had produced a strong Fascist 
movement the socalled Arrow Cross men and in  they followed Italy by passing their first 
antiJewish legislation despite the strong influence of the Catholic Church in the country the 
rulings applied to baptized Jews who had been converted after  and even those converted 
before that date were included three years later And yet when an allinclusive antiSemitism 
based on race had become official government policy eleven Jews continued to sit in the upper 
chamber of the Parliament and Hungary was the only Axis country to send Jewish troops  a 
hundred and thirty thousand of them in auxiliary service but in Hungarian uniform  to the 
Eastern front The explanation of these inconsistencies is that the Hungarians their official policy 
notwithstanding were even more emphatic than other countries in distinguishing between native 
Jews and Ostjuden between the Magyarized Jews of Trianon Hungary established like the 
other Successor States by the Treaty of Trianon and those of recently annexed territories 
Hungarys sovereignty was respected by the Nazi government until March  with the result 
that for Jews the country became an island of safety in an ocean of destruction While it is 
understandable enough that  with the Red Army approaching through the Carpathian Mountains 
and the Hungarian government desperately trying to follow the example of Italy and conclude a 
separate armistice  the German government should have decided to occupy the country it is 
almost incredible that at this stage of the game it should still have been the order of the day to 
come to grips with the Jewish problem the liquidation of which was a prerequisite for involving 
Hungary in the war as Veesenmayer put it in a report to the Foreign Office in December  
For the liquidation of this problem involved the evacuation of eight hundred thousand Jews 
plus an estimated hundred or hundred and fifty thousand converted Jews 
Be that as it may as I have said earlier because of the greatness and the urgency of the task 
Eichmann arrived in Budapest in March  with his whole staff which he could easily 
assemble since the job had been finished everywhere else He called Wisliceny and Brunner 
from Slovakia and Greece Abromeit from Yugoslavia Dannecker from Paris and Bulgaria 
Siegfried Seidl from his post as Commander of Theresienstadt and from Vienna Hermann 

Krumey who became his deputy in Hungary From Berlin he brought all the more important 
members of his office staff Rolf Gnther who had been his chief deputy Franz Novak his 
deportation officer and Otto Hunsche his legal expert Thus the Sondereinsatzkommando 
Eichmann Eichmann Special Operation Unit consisted of about ten men plus some clerical 
assistants when it set up its headquarters in Budapest On the very evening of their arrival 
Eichmann and his men invited the Jewish leaders to a conference to persuade them to form a 
Jewish Council through which they could issue their orders and to which they would give in 
return absolute jurisdiction over all Jews in Hungary This was no easy trick at this moment and 
in that place It was a time when in the words of the Papal Nuncio the whole world knew what 
deportation meant in practice in Budapest moreover the Jews had had a unique opportunity to 
follow the fate of European Jewry We knew very well about the work of the Einsatzgruppen We 
knew more than was necessary about Auschwitz as Dr Kastner was to testify at Nuremberg 
Clearly more than Eichmanns allegedly hypnotic powers was needed to convince anyone that 
the Nazis would recognize the sacred distinction between Magyarized and Eastern Jews self
deception had to have been developed to a high art to allow Hungarian Jewish leaders to believe 
at this moment that it cant happen here  How can they send the Jews of Hungary outside 
Hungary  and to keep believing it even when the realities contradicted this belief every day of 
the week How this was achieved came to light in one of the most remarkable non sequiturs 
uttered on the witness stand the future members of the Central Jewish Committee as the Jewish 
Council was called in Hungary had heard from neighboring Slovakia that Wisliceny who was 
now negotiating with them accepted money readily and they also knew that despite all bribes he 
had deported all the Jews in Slovakia From which Mr Freudiger concluded I understood 
that it was necessary to find ways and means to establish relationships with Wisliceny 
Eichmanns cleverest trick in these difficult negotiations was to see to it that he and his men acted 
as though they were corrupt The president of the Jewish community Hofrat Samuel Stern a 
member of Horthys Privy Council was treated with exquisite courtesy and agreed to be head of 
the Jewish Council He and the other members of the Council felt reassured when they were 
asked to supply typewriters and mirrors womens lingerie and eau de cologne original Watteaus 
and eight pianos  even though seven of these were gracefully returned by Hauptsturmfhrer 
Novak who remarked But gentlemen I dont want to open a piano store I only want to play the 
piano Eichmann himself visited the Jewish Library and the Jewish Museum and assured 
everybody that all measures would be temporary And corruption first simulated as a trick soon 
turned out to be real enough though it did not take the form the Jews had hoped Nowhere else 
did Jews spend so much money without any results whatever In the words of the strange Mr 
Kastner A Jew who trembles for his life and that of his family loses all sense of money Sic 
This was confirmed during the trial through testimony given by Philip von Freudiger mentioned 
above as well as through the testimony of Joel Brand who had represented a rival Jewish body 
in Hungary the Zionist Relief and Rescue Committee Krumey received no less than two hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars from Freudiger in April  and the Rescue Committee paid twenty 
thousand dollars merely for the privilege of meeting with Wisliceny and some men of the SS 
Counterintelligence service At this meeting each of those present received an additional tip of a 
thousand dollars and Wisliceny brought up again the socalled Europe Plan which he had 
proposed in vain in  and according to which Himmler supposedly would be prepared to spare 
all Jews except those in Poland for a ransom of two or three million dollars On the strength of 
this proposal which had been shelved long before the Jews now started paying installments to 
Wisliceny Even Eichmanns idealism broke down in this land of unheardof abundance The 
prosecution though it could not prove that Eichmann had profited financially while on the job 
stressed rightly his high standard of living in Budapest where he could afford to stay at one of the 
best hotels was driven around by a chauffeur in an amphibious car an unforgettable gift from his 
later enemy Kurt Becher went hunting and horseback riding and enjoyed all sorts of previously 
unknown luxuries under the tutelage of his new friends in the Hungarian government 
There existed however a sizable group of Jews in the country whose leaders at least indulged 
less in selfdeception The Zionist movement had always been particularly strong in Hungary and 
it now had its own representation in the recently formed Relief and Rescue Committee the 
Vaadat Ezra va Hazalah which maintaining close contact with the Palestine Office had helped 
refugees from Poland and Slovakia from Yugoslavia and Rumania the committee was in 

constant communication with the American Joint Distribution Committee which financed their 
work and they had also been able to get a few Jews into Palestine legally or illegally Now that 
catastrophe had come to their own country they turned to forging Christian papers certificates 
of baptism whose bearers found it easier to go underground Whatever else they might have 
been the Zionist leaders knew they were outlaws and they acted accordingly Joel Brand the 
unlucky emissary who was to present to the Allies in the midst of the war Himmlers proposal to 
give them a million Jewish lives in exchange for ten thousand trucks was one of the leading 
officials of the Relief and Rescue Committee and he came to Jerusalem to testify about his 
dealings with Eichmann as did his former rival in Hungary Philip von Freudiger While Freudiger 
whom Eichmann incidentally did not remember at all recalled the rudeness with which he had 
been treated at these interviews Brands testimony actually substantiated much of Eichmanns 
own account of how he had negotiated with the Zionists Brand had been told that an idealistic 
German was now talking to him an idealistic Jew  two honorable enemies meeting as equals 
during a lull in the battle Eichmann had said to him Tomorrow perhaps we shall again be on the 
battlefield It was of course a horrible comedy but it did go to show that Eichmanns weakness 
for uplifting phrases with no real meaning was not a pose fabricated expressly for the Jerusalem 
trial What is more interesting one cannot fail to note that in meeting with the Zionists neither 
Eichmann nor any other member of the Sondereinsatzkommando employed the tactics of sheer 
lying that they had used for the benefit of the gentlemen of the Jewish Council Even language 
rules were suspended and most of the time a spade was called a spade Moreover when it was 
a question of serious negotiations  over the amount of money that might buy an exit permit over 
the Europe Plan over the exchange of lives for trucks  not only Eichmann but everybody 
concerned Wisliceny Becher the gentlemen of the Counterintelligence service whom Joel Brand 
used to meet every morning in a coffee house turned to the Zionists as a matter of course The 
reason for this was that the Relief and Rescue Committee possessed the required international 
connections and could more easily produce foreign currency whereas the members of the 
Jewish Council had nothing behind them but the more than dubious protection of Regent Horthy 
It also became clear that the Zionist functionaries in Hungary had received greater privileges than 
the usual temporary immunity to arrest and deportation granted the members of the Jewish 
Council The Zionists were free to come and go practically as they pleased they were exempt 
from wearing the yellow star they received permits to visit concentration camps in Hungary and 
somewhat later Dr Kastner the original founder of the Relief and Rescue Committee could 
even travel about Nazi Germany without any identification papers showing he was a Jew 
The organization of a Jewish Council was for Eichmann with all his experience in Vienna 
Prague and Berlin a routine matter that took no more than two weeks The question now was 
whether he himself would be able to enlist the help of Hungarian officials for an operation of this 
magnitude For him this was something new In the ordinary course of events it would have been 
handled for him by the Foreign Office and its representatives in this instance by the newly 
appointed Reich plenipotentiary Dr Edmund Veesenmayer to whom Eichmann would have sent 
a Jewish adviser Eichmann himself clearly had no inclination for playing the role of adviser a 
post that had nowhere carried a rank higher than Hauptsturmfhrer or captain whereas he was 
an Obersturmbannfhrer or lieutenant colonel two ranks higher His greatest triumph in Hungary 
was that he could establish his own contacts Three men were primarily concerned  Lszlo 
Endre who because of an antiSemitism that even Horthy had called insane had recently been 
appointed State Secretary in Charge of Political Jewish Affairs in the Ministry of the Interior 
Lszlo Baky also an undersecretary in the Ministry of the Interior who was in charge of the 
Gerularmerie the Hungarian police and the police officer Lieutenant Colonel Ferenczy who was 
directly in charge of deportations With their help Eichmann could be sure that everything the 
issuance of the necessary decrees and the concentration of the Jews in the provinces would 
proceed with lightning speed In Vienna a special conference was held with the German State 
Railroad officials since this matter involved the transportation of nearly half a million people 
Hss at Auschwitz was informed of the plans through his own superior General Richard Glcks 
of the WVHA and ordered a new branch line of the railway built to bring the cars within a few 
yards of the crematoria the number of death commandos manning the gas chambers was 
increased from  to  so that everything was ready for killing between six thousand and 
twelve thousand people a day When the trains began arriving in May  very few able

bodied men were selected for labor and these few worked in Krupps fuse factory at Auschwitz 
Krupps newly built factory near Breslau in Germany the Berthawerk collected Jewish 
manpower wherever it could find it and kept those men in conditions that were unsurpassed even 
among the labor gangs in the death camps 
The whole operation in Hungary lasted less than two months and came to a sudden stop at the 
beginning of July Thanks chiefly to the Zionists it had been better publicized than any other 
phase of the Jewish catastrophe and Horthy had been deluged with protests from neutral 
countries and from the Vatican The Papal Nuncio though deemed it appropriate to explain that 
the Vaticans protest did not spring from a false sense of compassion  a phrase that is likely to 
be a lasting monument to what the continued dealings with and the desire to compromise with 
the men who preached the gospel of ruthless toughness had done to the mentality of the 
highest dignitaries of the Church Sweden once more led the way with regard to practical 
measures by distributing entry permits and Switzerland Spain and Portugal followed her 
example so that finally about thirtythree thousand Jews were living in special houses in 
Budapest under the protection of neutral countries The Allies had received and made public a list 
of seventy men whom they knew to be the chief culprits and Roosevelt had sent an ultimatum 
threatening that Hungarys fate will not be like any other civilized nation   unless the 
deportations are stopped The point was driven home by an unusually heavy air raid on 
Budapest on July  Thus pressed from all sides Horthy gave the order to stop the deportations 
and one of the most damning pieces of evidence against Eichmann was the rather obvious fact 
that he had not obeyed the old fools order but in midJuly deported another fifteen hundred 
Jews who were at hand in a concentration camp near Budapest To prevent the Jewish officials 
from informing Horthy he assembled the members of the two representative bodies in his office 
where Dr Hunsche detained them on various pretexts until he learned that the train had left 
Hungarian territory Eichmann remembered nothing of this episode in Jerusalem and although 
the judges were convinced that the accused remembers his victory over Horthy very well this is 
doubtful since to Eichmann Horthy was not such a great personage 
This seems to have been the last train that left Hungary for Auschwitz In August  the Red 
Army was in Rumania and Eichmann was sent there on his wildgoose chase When he came 
back the Horthy regime had gathered sufficient courage to demand the withdrawal of the 
Eichmann commando and Eichmann himself asked Berlin to let him and his men return since 
they had become superfluous But Berlin did nothing of the sort and was proved right for in 
midOctober the situation once more changed abruptly With the Russians no more than a 
hundred miles from Budapest the Nazis succeeded in overthrowing the Horthy government and 
in appointing the leader of the Arrow Cross men Ferenc Szalasi head of state No more 
transports could be sent to Auschwitz since the extermination facilities were about to be 
dismantled while at the same time the German shortage of labor had grown even more 
desperate Now it was Veesenmayer the Reich plenipotentiary who negotiates with the 
Hungarian Ministry of the Interior for permission to ship fifty thousand Jews  men between 
sixteen and sixty and women under forty  to the Reich he added in his report that Eichmann 
hoped to send fifty thousand more Since railroad facilities no longer existed this led to the foot 
marches of November  which were stopped only by an order from Himmler The Jews who 
were sent on the marches had been arrested at random by the Hungarian police regardless of 
exemptions to which by now many were entitled regardless also of the age limits specified in the 
original directives The marchers were escorted by Arrow Cross men who robbed them and 
treated them with the utmost brutality And that was the end Of an original Jewish population of 
eight hundred thousand some hundred and sixty thousand must still have remained in the 
Budapest ghetto  the countryside was judenrein  and of these tens of thousands became victims 
of spontaneous pogroms On February   the country surrendered to the Red Army 
The chief Hungarian culprits in the massacre were all put on trial condemned to death and 
executed None of the German initiators except Eichmann paid with more than a few years in 
prison 
SLOVAKIA like Croatia was an invention of the German Foreign Office The Slovaks had come 
to Berlin to negotiate their independence even before the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in 
March  and at that time they had promised Gring that they would follow Germany faithfully 
in their handling of the Jewish question But this had been in the winter of  when no one 

had yet heard of such a thing as the Final Solution The tiny country with a poor peasant 
population of about two and a half million and with ninety thousand Jews was primitive 
backward and deeply Catholic It was ruled at the time by a Catholic priest Father Josef Tiso 
Even its Fascist movement the Hlinka Guard was Catholic in outlook and the vehement anti
Semitism of these clerical Fascists or Fascist clerics differed in both style and content from the 
ultramodern racism of their German masters There was only one modern antiSemite in the 
Slovak government and that was Eichmanns good friend Sano Mach Minister of the Interior All 
the others were Christians or thought they were whereas the Nazis were in principle of course 
as antiChristian as they were antiJewish The Slovaks being Christians meant not only that they 
felt obliged to emphasize what the Nazis considered an obsolete distinction between baptized 
and nonbaptized Jews but also that they thought of the whole issue in medieval terms For them 
a solution consisted in expelling the Jews and inheriting their property but not in systematic 
exterminating although they did not mind occasional killing The greatest sin of the Jews was 
not that they belonged to an alien race but that they were rich The Jews in Slovakia were not 
very rich by Western standards but when fiftytwo thousand of them had to declare their 
possessions because they owned more than two hundred dollars worth and it turned out that 
their total property amounted to a hundred million dollars every single one of them must have 
looked to the Slovaks like an incarnation of Croesus 
During their first year and a half of independence the Slovaks were busy trying to solve the 
Jewish question according to their own lights They transferred the larger Jewish enterprises to 
nonJews enacted some antiJewish legislation which according to the Germans had the basic 
defect of exempting baptized Jews who had been converted prior to  planned to set up 
ghettos following the example of the General Government and mobilized Jews for forced labor 
Very early in September  they had been given a Jewish adviser Hauptsturmfhrer Dieter 
Wisliceny once Eichmanns greatly admired superior and friend in the Security Service his 
eldest son was named Dieter and now his equal in rank was attached to the German legation in 
Bratislava Wisliceny did not marry and therefore could not be promoted further so a year later 
he was outranked by Eichmann and became his subordinate Eichmann thought that this must 
have rankled with him and that it helped explain why he had given such damning evidence 
against him as witness in the Nuremberg Trials and had even offered to find out his hiding place 
But this is doubtful Wisliceny probably was interested only in saving his own skin he was utterly 
unlike Eichmann He belonged to the educated stratum of the SS lived among books and 
records had himself addressed as Baron by the Jews in Hungary and generally was much 
more concerned with money than worried about his career consequently he was one of the very 
first in the SS to develop moderate  tendencies 
 
Nothing much happened in Slovakia during these early years until March  when Eichmann 
appeared in Bratislava to negotiate the evacuation of twenty thousand young and strong labor 
Jews Four weeks later Heydrich himself came to see the Prime Minister Vojtek Tuka and 
persuaded him to let all Jews be resettled in the East including the converted Jews who had thus 
far been exempted The government with a priest at its head did not at all mind correcting the 
basic defect of distinguishing between Christians and Jews on the grounds of religion when it 
learned that no claim was put forward by the Germans in regard to the property of these Jews 
except the payment of five hundred Reichsmarks in exchange for each Jew received on the 
contrary the government demanded an additional guaranty from the German Foreign Office that 
Jews removed from Slovakia and received by the Germans would stay in the Eastern areas 
forever and would not be given an opportunity of returning to Slovakia To follow up these 
negotiations on the highest level Eichmann paid a second visit to Bratislava the one that 
coincided with Heydrichs assassination and by June  fiftytwo thousand Jews had been 
deported by the Slovak police to the killing centers in Poland 
There were still some thirtyfive thousand Jews left in the country and they all belonged to the 
originally exempted categories  converted Jews and their parents members of certain 
professions young men in forced labor battalions a few businessmen It was at this moment 
when most of the Jews had already been resettled that the Bratislava Jewish Relief and 
Rescue Committee a sister body of the Hungarian Zionist group succeeded in bribing Wisliceny 
who promised to help to slow down the pace of the deportations and who also proposed the so

called Europe Plan which he was to bring up again later in Budapest It is very unlikely that 
Wisliceny ever did anything except read books and listen to music and of course accept 
whatever he could get But it was just at this moment that the Vatican informed the Catholic 
clergy of the true meaning of the word resettlement From then on as the German Ambassador 
Hans Elard Ludin reported to the Foreign Office in Berlin the deportations became very 
unpopular and the Slovak government began pressing the Germans for permission to visit the 
resettlement centers  which of course neither Wisliceny nor Eichmann could grant since the 
resettled Jews were no longer among the living In December  Dr Edmund Veesenmayer 
came to Bratislava to see Father Tiso himself he had been sent by Hitler and his orders specified 
that he should tell Tiso to come down to earth Fraktur mit ihm reden Tiso promised to put 
between sixteen and eighteen thousand unconverted Jews in concentration camps and to 
establish a special camp for about ten thousand baptized Jews but he did not agree to 
deportations In June  Veesenmayer now Reich plenipotentiary in Hungary appeared 
again and demanded that the remaining Jews in the country be included in the Hungarian 
operations Tiso refused again 
In August  as the Red Army drew near a fullfledged revolt broke out in Slovakia and the 
Germans occupied the country By this time Wisliceny was in Hungary and he probably was no 
longer trusted anyway The RSHA sent Alois Brunner to Bratislava to arrest and deport the 
remaining Jews Brunner first arrested and deported the officials of the Relief and Rescue 
Committee and then this time with the help of German SS units deported another twelve or 
fourteen thousand people On April   when the Russians arrived in Bratislava there were 
perhaps twenty thousand Jews left who had survived the catastrophe 
 
 
 
XIII  The Killing Centers in the East 
 
 
When the Nazis spoke of the East they meant a huge area that embraced Poland the Baltic 
States and occupied Russian territory It was divided into four administrative units the 
Warthegau consisting of the Polish Western Regions annexed to the Reich under Gauleiter 
Artur Greiser the Ostland including Lithuania Latvia and Estonia and the rather indefinite area 
of White Russia with Riga as the seat of the occupation authorities the General Government of 
central Poland under Hans Frank and the Ukraine under Alfred Rosenbergs Ministry for the 
Occupied Eastern Territories These were the first countries on which testimony was presented in 
the case for the prosecution and they were the last to be dealt with in the judgment 
No doubt both the prosecution and the judges had excellent reasons for their opposite decisions 
The East was the central scene of Jewish suffering the gruesome terminal of all deportations the 
place from which there was hardly ever any escape and where the number of survivors rarely 
reached more than five per cent The East moreover had been the center of the prewar Jewish 
population in Europe more than three million Jews had lived in Poland two hundred and sixty 
thousand in the Baltic states and more than half of the estimated three million Russian Jews in 
White Russia the Ukraine and the Crimea Since the prosecution was interested primarily in the 
suffering of the Jewish people and the dimensions of the genocide attempted upon it it was 
logical to start here and then see how much specific responsibility for this unmitigated hell could 
be blamed upon the accused The trouble was that the evidence relating Eichmann to the East 
was scanty and this was blamed on the fact that the Gestapo files and particularly the files of 
Eichmanns section had been destroyed by the Nazis This scarcity of documentary evidence 
gave the prosecution a probably welcome pretext for calling an endless procession of witnesses 
to testify to events in the East though this was hardly its only reason for doing so The 
prosecution  as had been hinted during the trial but was fully described later in the special 
Bulletin issued in April  by Yad Vashem the Israeli archive on the Nazi period  had been 
under considerable pressure from Israeli survivors who constitute about twenty per cent of the 
present population of the country They had flocked spontaneously to the trial authorities and also 
to Yad Vashem which had been officially commissioned to prepare some of the documentary 
evidence to offer themselves as witnesses The worst cases of strong imagination people who 

had seen Eichmann at various places where he had never been were weeded out but fiftysix 
sufferingsoftheJewishpeople witnesses as the trial authorities called them were finally put 
on the stand instead of some fifteen or twenty background witnesses as originally planned 
twentythree sessions out of a total of a hundred and twentyone were entirely devoted to 
background which meant they had no apparent bearing upon the case Though the witnesses 
for the prosecution were hardly ever crossexamined by either the defense or the judges the 
judgment did not accept evidence that had bearing on Eichmann unless it was given some other 
corroboration Thus the judges refused to charge Eichmann with the murder of the Jewish boy in 
Hungary or with having instigated the Kristallnacht in Germany and Austria of which he certainly 
knew nothing at the time and even in Jerusalem knew considerably less than the least well
informed student of the period or with the murder of ninetythree children of Lidice who after 
Heydrichs assassination were deported to Ldz since it has not been proved beyond 
reasonable doubt according to the evidence before us that they were murdered or with 
responsibility for the hideous operations of Unit  amongst the most horrifying parts of all the 
evidence submitted by the prosecution which had had the task of opening the mass graves in 
the East and disposing of the corpses in order to efface all traces of slaughter and was 
commanded by Standartenfhrer Paul Blobel who according to his own testimony at 
Nuremberg took orders from Mller the head of Section IV of the RSHA or with the dreadful 
conditions under which Jews left alive in the extermination camps were evacuated to German 
concentration camps especially to BergenBelsen during the last months of the war The gist of 
the background witnesses testimony about conditions in the Polish ghettos about procedures in 
the various death camps about forced labor and generally the attempt to exterminate through 
labor was never in dispute on the contrary there was hardly anything in what they told that had 
not been known before If Eichmanns name was mentioned at all it obviously was hearsay 
evidence rumors testified to hence without legal validity The testimony of all witnesses who 
had seen him with their own eyes collapsed the moment a question was addressed to them 
and the judgment found that the center of gravity of his activities was within the Reich itself the 
Protectorate and in the countries of Europe to the west north south southeast and Central 
Europe  that is everywhere except in the East Why then did the court not waive these 
hearings which lasted for weeks and months on end In discussing this question the judgment 
was somewhat apologetic and finally gave an explanation that was curiously inconsistent Since 
the accused denied all the counts in the indictment the judges could not dismiss evidence on 
the factual background The accused however had never denied these facts in the indictment 
he had only denied that he was responsible for them in the sense of the indictment 
Actually the judges were faced with a highly unpleasant dilemma At the very beginning of the 
trial Dr Servatius had impugned the impartiality of the judges no Jew in his opinion was 
qualified to sit in judgment on the implementers of the Final Solution and the presiding judge had 
replied We are professional judges used and accustomed to weighing evidence brought before 
us and to doing our work in the public eye and subject to public criticism    When a court sits in 
judgment the judges who compose it are human beings are flesh and blood with feelings and 
senses but they are obliged by the law to restrain those feelings and senses Otherwise no 
judge could ever be found to try a criminal case where his abhorrence might be aroused    It 
cannot be denied that the memory of the Nazi holocaust stirs every Jew but while this case is 
being tried before us it will be our duty to restrain these feelings and this duty we shall honor 
Which was good and fair enough unless Dr Servatius meant to imply that Jews might lack a 
proper understanding of the problem their presence caused in the midst of the nations of the 
world and hence would fail to appreciate a final solution of it But the irony of the situation was 
that in case he had felt inclined to make this argument he could have been answered that the 
accused according to his own emphatically repeated testimony had learned all he knew about 
the Jewish question from JewishZionist authors from the basic books of Theodor Herzl and 
Adolf Bhm Who then could be better qualified to try him than these three men who had all 
been Zionists since their early youth 
It was not with respect to the accused then but with respect to the background witnesses that 
the fact of the Jewishness of the judges of their living in a country where every fifth person was a 
survivor became acute and troublesome Mr Hausner had gathered together a tragic multitude 
of sufferers each of them eager not to miss this unique opportunity each of them convinced of 

his right to his day in court The judges might and did quarrel with the prosecutor about the 
wisdom and even the appropriateness of using the occasion for painting general pictures but 
once a witness had taken the stand it was difficult indeed to interrupt him to cut short such 
testimony because of the honor of the witness and because of the matters about which he 
speaks as Judge Landau put it Who were they humanly speaking to deny any of these people 
their day in court And who would have dared humanly speaking to question their veracity as to 
detail when they poured out their hearts as they stood in the witness box even though what 
they had to tell could only be regarded as byproducts of the trial 
There was an additional difficulty In Israel as in most other countries a person appearing in 
court is deemed innocent until proved guilty But in the case of Eichmann this was an obvious 
fiction If he had not been found guilty before he appeared in Jerusalem guilty beyond any 
reasonable doubt the Israelis would never have dared or wanted to kidnap him Prime Minister 
BenGurion explaining to the President of Argentina in a letter dated June   why Israel 
had committed a formal violation of Argentine law wrote that it was Eichmann who organized 
the mass murder of six million of our people on a gigantic and unprecedented scale throughout 
Europe In contrast to normal arrests in ordinary criminal cases where suspicion of guilt must be 
proved to be substantial and reasonable but not beyond reasonable doubt  that is the task of the 
ensuing trial  Eichmanns illegal arrest could be justified and was justified in the eyes of the 
world only by the fact that the outcome of the trial could be safely anticipated His role in the 
Final Solution it now turned out had been wildly exaggerated   partly because of his own 
boasting partly because the defendants at Nuremberg and in other postwar trials had tried to 
exculpate themselves at his expense and chiefly because he had been in close contact with 
Jewish functionaries since he was the one German official who was an expert in Jewish affairs 
and in nothing else The prosecution basing its case upon sufferings that were not a bit 
exaggerated had exaggerated the exaggeration beyond rhyme or reason  or so one thought 
until the judgment of the Court of Appeal was handed down in which one could read It was a 
fact that the appellant had received no superior orders at all He was his own superior and he 
gave all orders in matters that concerned Jewish affairs That had been precisely the argument 
of the prosecution which the judges in the District Court had not accepted but dangerous 
nonsense though it was the Court of Appeal fully endorsed it It was supported chiefly by the 
testimony of Justice Michael A Musmanno author of Ten Days to Die  and a former judge 
at Nuremberg who had come from America to testify for the prosecution Mr Musmanno had sat 
on the trials of the administrators of the concentration camps and of the members of the mobile 
killing units in the East and while Eichmanns name had come up in the proceedings he had 
mentioned it only once in his judgments He had however interviewed the Nuremberg 
defendants in their prison And there Ribbentrop had told him that Hitler would have been all right 
if he had not fallen under Eichmanns influence Well Mr Musmanno did not believe all he was 
told but he did believe that Eichmann had been given his commission by Hitler himself and that 
his power came by speaking through Himmler and through Heydrich A few sessions later Mr 
Gustave M Gilbert professor of psychology at Long Island University and author of Nuremberg 
Diary  appeared as a witness for the prosecution He was more cautious than Justice 
Musmanno whom he had introduced to the defendants at Nuremberg Gilbert testified that 
Eichmann    wasnt thought of very much by the major Nazi war criminals 
 at that time and also that Eichmann whom they both assumed dead had not been mentioned 
in discussions of the war crimes between Gilbert and Musmanno The District Court judges 
then because they saw through the exaggerations of the prosecution and had no wish to make 
Eichmann the superior of Himmler and the inspirer of Hitler were put in the position of having to 
defend the accused The task apart from its unpleasantness was of no consequence for either 
judgment or sentence as the legal and moral responsibility of him who delivers the victim to his 
death is in our opinion no smaller and may even be greater than the liability of him who does the 
victim to death 
The judges way out of all these difficulties was through compromise The judgment falls into two 
parts and the by far larger part consists of a rewriting of the prosecutions case The judges 
indicated their fundamentally different approach by starting with Germany and ending with the 
East for this meant that they intended to concentrate on what had been done instead of on what 
the Jews had suffered In an obvious rebuff to the prosecution they said explicitly that sufferings 

on so gigantic a scale were beyond human understanding a matter for great authors and 
poets and did not belong in a courtroom whereas the deeds and motives that had caused them 
were neither beyond understanding nor beyond judgment They even went so far as to state that 
they would base their findings upon their own presentation and indeed they would have been 
lost if they had not gone to the enormous amount of work that this implied They got a firm grasp 
on the intricate bureaucratic setup of the Nazi machinery of destruction so that the position of the 
accused could be understood In contrast to the introductory speech of Mr Hausner which has 
already been published as a book the judgment can be studied with profit by those with a 
historical interest in this period But the judgement so pleasantly devoid of cheap oratory would 
have destroyed the case for the prosecution altogether if the judges had not found reason to 
charge Eichmann with some responsibility for crimes in the East in addition to the main crime to 
which he had confessed namely that he had shipped people to their death in full awareness of 
what he was doing 
Four points were chiefly in dispute There was first the question of Eichmanns participation in 
the mass slaughter carried out in the East by the Einsatzgruppen which had been set up by 
Heydrich at a meeting held in March  at which Eichmann was present However since the 
commanders of the Einsatzgruppen were members of the intellectual lite of the SS while their 
troops were either criminals or ordinary soldiers drafted for punitive duty  nobody could volunteer 
 Eichmann was connected with this important phase of the Final Solution only in that he received 
the reports of the killers which he then had to summarize for his superiors These reports though 
top secret were mimeographed and went to between fifty and seventy other offices in the 
Reich in each of which there sat of course some Oberregierungsrat who summarized them for 
the higherups There was in addition to this the testimony of Justice Musmanno who claimed 
that Walter Schellenberg who had drawn up the draft agreement between Heydrich and General 
Walter von Brauchitsch of the military command specifying that the Einsatzgruppen were to 
enjoy full freedom in the execution of their plans as regards the civil population that is in the 
killing of civilians had told him in a conversation at Nuremberg that Eichmann had controlled 
these operations and had even personally supervised them The judges for reasons of 
caution were unwilling to rely on an uncorroborated statement of Schellenbergs and threw out 
this evidence Schellenberg must have had a remarkably low opinion of the Nuremberg judges 
and their ability to find their way through the labyrinthine administrative structure of the Third 
Reich Hence all that was left was evidence that Eichmann was well informed of what was going 
on in the East which had never been in dispute and the judgment surprisingly concluded that 
this evidence was sufficient to constitute proof of actual participation 
The second point dealing with the deportation of Jews from Polish ghettos to the nearby killing 
centers had more to recommend it It was indeed logical to assume that the transportation 
expert would have been active in the territory under the General Government However we know 
from many other sources that the Higher SS and Police Leaders were in charge of 
transportation for this whole area  to the great grief of Governor General Hans Frank who in his 
diary complained endlessly about interference in this matter without ever mentioning Eichmanns 
name Franz Novak Eichmanns transportation officer testifying for the defense corroborated 
Eichmanns version occasionally of course they had had to negotiate with the manager of the 
Ostbahn the Eastern Railways because shipments from the western parts of Europe had to be 
coordinated with local operations Of these transactions Wisliceny had given a good account at 
Nuremberg Novak used to contact the Ministry of Transport which in turn had to obtain 
clearance from the Army if the trains entered a theater of war The Army could veto transports 
What Wisliceny did not tell and what is perhaps more interesting is that the Army used its right of 
veto only in the initial years when German troops were on the offensive in  when the 
deportations from Hungary clogged the lines of retreat for whole G an armies in desperate flight 
no vetoes were forthcoming But when for instance the Warsaw ghetto as evacuated in  at 
the rate of five thousand people a day Himmler himself conducted the negotiations with the 
railway authorities and Eichmann and his outfit had nothing whatever to do with them The 
judgment finally fell back on testimony given by a witness at the Hss trial that some Jews from 
the General Government area had arrived in Auschwitz together with Jews from Bialystok a 
Polish city that had been incorporated into the German province of East Prussia and hence fell 
within Eichmanns jurisdiction Yet even in the Warthegau which was Reich territory it was not 

the RSHA but Gauleiter Greiser who was in charge of extermination and deportation And 
although in January  Eichmann visited the Ldz ghetto  the largest in the East and the last 
to be liquidated  again it was Himmler himself who a month later came to see Greiser and 
ordered the liquidation of Ldz Unless one accepted the prosecutions preposterous claim that 
Eichmann had been able to inspire Himmlers orders the mere fact that Eichmann shipped Jews 
to Auschwitz could not possibly prove that all Jews who arrived there had been shipped by him 
In view of Eichmanns strenuous denials and the utter lack of corroborative evidence the 
conclusions of the judgment on this point appeared unhappily to constitute a case of in dubio 
contra reum 
The third point to be considered was Eichmanns liability for what went on in the extermination 
camps in which according to the prosecution he had enjoyed great authority It spoke for the 
high degree of independence and fairness of the judges that they threw out all the accumulated 
testimony of the witnesses on these matters Their argument here was foolproof and showed their 
true understanding of the whole situation They started by explaining that there had existed two 
categories of Jews in the camps the socalled transport Jews Transportjuden who made up 
the bulk of the population and who had never committed an offense even in the eyes of the 
Nazis and the Jews in protective custody Schutzhaftjuden who had been sent to German 
concentration camps for some transgression and who under the totalitarian principle of directing 
the full terror of the regime against the innocents were considerably better off than the others 
even when they were shipped to the East in order to make the concentration camps in the Reich 
judenrein In the words of Mrs Raja Kagan an excellent witness on Auschwitz it was the great 
paradox of Auschwitz Those caught committing a criminal offense were treated better than the 
others They were not subject to the selection and as a rule they survived Eichmann had 
nothing to do with Schutzhaftjuden but Transportjuden his speciality were by definition 
condemned to death except for the twentyfive per cent of especially strong individuals who 
might be selected for labor in some camps In the version presented by the judgment however 
that question was no longer at issue Eichmann knew of course that the overwhelming majority 
of his victims were condemned to death but since the selection for labor was made by the SS 
physicians on the spot and since the lists of deportees were usually made up by the Jewish 
Councils in the home countries or by the Order Police but never by Eichmann or his men the 
truth was that he had no authority to say who would die and who would live he could not even 
know The question was whether Eichmann had lied when he said I never killed a Jew or for 
that matter I never killed a nonJew    I never gave an order to kill a Jew nor an order to kill a 
nonJew The prosecution unable to understand a mass murderer who had never killed and 
who in this particular instance probably did not even have the guts to kill was constantly trying to 
prove individual murder 
This brings us to the fourth and last question concerning Eichmanns general authority in the 
Eastern territories  the question of his responsibility for living conditions in the ghettos for the 
unspeakable misery endured in them and for their final liquidation which had been the subject of 
testimony by most witnesses Again Eichmann had been fully informed but none of this had 
anything to do with his job The prosecution made a laborious effort to prove that it had on the 
ground that Eichmann had freely admitted that every once in a while he had to decide according 
to everchanging directives on this matter what to do with the Jews of foreign nationality who 
were trapped in Poland This he said was a question of national importance involving the 
Foreign Office and was beyond the horizon of the local authorities With respect to such Jews 
there existed two different trends in all German offices the radical trend which would have 
ignored all distinctions  a Jew was a Jew period  and the moderate trend which thought it 
better to put these Jews on ice for exchange purposes The notion of exchange Jews seems to 
have been Himmlers idea After Americas entry into the war he wrote to Mller in December 
 that all Jews with influential relatives in the United States should be put into a special 
camp    and stay alive adding Such Jews are for us precious hostages I have a figure of ten 
thousand in mind Needless to say Eichmann belonged to the radicals he was against 
making exceptions for administrative as well as idealistic reasons But when in April  he 
wrote to the Foreign Office that in the future foreign nationals would be included in the measures 
taken by the Security Police within the Warsaw Ghetto where Jews with foreign passports had 
previously been carefully weeded out he was hardly acting as a decisionmaker on behalf of the 

RSHA in the East and he certainly did not possess executive powers there Still less could 
such powers or authority be derived from his having been used occasionally by Heydrich or 
Himmler to transmit certain orders to local commanders 
In a sense the truth of the matter was even worse than the court in Jerusalem assumed 
Heydrich the judgment argued had been given central authority over the implementation of the 
Final Solution without any territorial limitations hence Eichmann his chief deputy in this field 
was everywhere equally responsible This was quite true for the framework of the Final Solution 
but although Heydrich for purposes of coordination had called a representative of Hans Franks 
General Government Undersecretary of State Dr Josef Bhler to the Wannsee Conference the 
Final Solution did not really apply to the Eastern occupied territories for the simple reason that 
the fate of the Jews there had never been in the balance The massacre of Polish Jewry had 
been decided on by Hitler not in May or June  the date of the order for the Final Solution 
but in September  as the judges knew from testimony given at Nuremberg by Erwin 
Lahousen of the German Counterintelligence As early as September  Hitler had decided 
the murder of Polish Jews Hence the Jewish star was introduced into the General Government 
immediately after the occupation of the territory in November  while it was introduced into 
the German Reich only in  at the time of the Final Solution The judges had before them 
also the minutes of two conferences at the beginning of the war one of which Heydrich had 
called on September   as a meeting of department heads and commanders of the 
mobile killing units at which Eichmann then still a mere Hauptsturmfhrer had represented the 
Berlin Center for Jewish Emigration the other took place on January   and dealt with 
questions of evacuation and resettlement At both meetings the fate of the entire native 
population in the occupied territories was discussed  that is the solution of the Polish as well 
as the Jewish question 
Even at this early date the solution of the Polish problem was well advanced of the political 
leadership it was reported no more than three per cent was left in order to render this three 
per cent harmless they would have to be sent into concentration camps The middle strata of 
the Polish intelligentsia were to be registered and arrested  teachers clergy nobility 
legionaries returning officers etc  while the primitive Poles were to be added to German 
manpower as migratory laborers and to be evacuated from their homes The goal is The 
Pole has to become the eternal seasonal and migratory laborer his permanent residence should 
be in the region of Cracow The Jews were to be gathered into urban centers and assembled in 
ghettos where they can be easily controlled and conveniently evacuated later on Those Eastern 
territories that had been incorporated into the Reich  the socalled Warthegau West Prussia 
Danzig the province of Poznan and Upper Silesia  had to be immediately cleared of all Jews 
together with  Gypsies they were sent in freight trains into the General Government 
Himmler finally in his capacity as Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of German 
Folkdom gave orders for the evacuation of large portions of the Polish population from these 
territories recently annexed to the Reich The implementation of this organized migration of 
peoples as the judgment called it was assigned to Eichmann as chief of Subsection IVD in 
the RSHA whose task consisted in emigration evacuation It is important to remember that 
this negative demographic policy was by no means improvised as a result of German victories 
in the East It had been outlined as early as November  in the secret speech addressed by 
Hitler to members of the German High Command  see the socalled Hssbach Protocol Hitler 
had pointed out that he rejected all notions of conquering foreign nations that what he demanded 
was an empty space volkloser Raum in the East for the settlement of Germans His audience  
Blomberg Fritsch and Rder among others  knew quite well that no such empty space 
existed hence they must have known that a German victory in the East would automatically 
result in the evacuation of the entire native population The measures against Eastern Jews 
were not only the result of antiSemitism they were part and parcel of an allembracing 
demographic policy in the course of which had the Germans won the war the Poles would have 
suffered the same fate as the Jews  genocide This is no mere conjecture the Poles in Germany 
were already being forced to wear a distinguishing badge in which the P replaced the Jewish 
star and this as we have seen was always the first measure to be taken by the police in 
instituting the process of destruction 
An express letter sent to the commanders of the mobile killing units after the September meeting 

was among the documents submitted at the trial and was of special interest It refers only to the 
Jewish question in occupied territories and distinguishes between the final goal which must be 
kept secret and preliminary measures for reaching it Among the latter the document mentions 
expressly the concentration of Jews in the vicinity of railroad tracks It is characteristic that the 
phrase Final Solution of the Jewish question does not occur the final goal probably was the 
destruction of Polish Jews clearly nothing new to those present at the meeting what was new 
was only that those Jews who lived in newly annexed provinces of the Reich should be 
evacuated to Poland for this was indeed a first step toward making Germany judenrein hence 
toward the Final Solution 
As far as Eichmann was concerned the documents clearly showed that even at this stage he had 
next to nothing to do with what happened in the East Here too his role was that of an expert for 
transportation and emigration in the East no Jewish expert was needed no special 
directives were required and there existed no privileged categories Even the members of the 
Jewish Councils were invariably exterminated when the ghettos were finally liquidated There 
were no exceptions for the fate accorded the slave laborers was only a different slower kind of 
death Hence the Jewish bureaucracy whose role in these administrative massacres was felt to 
be so essential that the institution of Jewish Councils of Elders was immediately established 
played no part in the seizure and the concentration of the Jews The whole episode signals the 
end of the initial wild mass shootings in the rear of the armies It seems that the Army 
commanders had protested against the massacres of civilians and that Heydrich had come to an 
agreement with the German High Command establishing the principle of a complete cleanup 
once and for all of Jews the Polish intelligentsia the Catholic clergy and the nobility but 
determining that because of the magnitude of an operation in which two million Jews would have 
to be cleaned up the Jews should first be concentrated in ghettos 
If the judges had cleared Eichmann completely on these counts connected with the hairraising 
stories told over and over by witnesses at the trial they would not have arrived at a different 
judgment of guilt and Eichmann would not have escaped capital punishment The result would 
have been the same But they would have destroyed utterly and without compromise the case 
as the prosecution presented it 
 
 
 
XIV  Evidence and Witnesses 
 
 
During the last weeks of the war the SS bureaucracy was occupied chiefly with forging identity 
papers and with destroying the paper mountains that testified to six years of systematic murder 
Eichmanns department more successful than others had burned its files which of course did 
not achieve much since all its correspondence had been addressed to other State and Party 
offices whose files fell into the hands of the Allies There were more than enough documents left 
to tell the story of the Final Solution most of them known already from the Nuremberg Trials and 
the successor trials The story was confirmed by sworn and unsworn statements usually given by 
witnesses and defendants in previous trials and frequently by persons who were no longer alive 
All this as well as a certain amount of hearsay testimony was admitted as evidence according 
to Section  of the law under which Eichmann was tried which stipulates that the court may 
deviate from the rules of evidence provided it places on record the reasons which prompted 
such deviation The documentary evidence was supplemented by testimony taken abroad in 
German Austrian and Italian courts from sixteen witnesses who could not come to Jerusalem 
because the Attorney General had announced that he intended to put them on trial for crimes 
against the Jewish people Although during the first session he had declared And if the defense 
has people who are ready to come and be witnesses I shall not block the way I shall not put any 
obstacles he later refused to grant such people immunity Such immunity was entirely 
dependent upon the good will of the government prosecution under the Nazis and Nazi 
Collaborators Punishment Law is not mandatory Since it was highly unlikely that any of the 
sixteen gentlemen would have come to Israel under any circumstances  seven of them were in 
prison  this was a technical point but it was of considerable importance It served to refute 

Israels claim that an Israeli court was at least technically the most suitable for a trial against the 
implementers of the Final Solution because documents and witnesses were more abundant 
than in any other country and the claim with respect to documents was doubtful in any event 
since the Israeli archive Yad Vashem was founded at a comparatively late date and is in no way 
superior to other archives It quickly turned out that Israel was the only country in the world where 
defense witnesses could not be heard and where certain witnesses for the prosecution those 
who had given affidavits in previous trials could not be crossexamined by the defense And this 
was all the more serious as the accused and his lawyer were indeed not in a position to obtain 
their own defense documents Dr Servatius had submitted a hundred and ten documents as 
against fifteen hundred submitted by the prosecution but of the former only about a dozen 
originated with the defense and they consisted mostly of excerpts from books by Poliakov or 
Reitlinger all the rest with the exception of the seventeen charts drawn by Eichmann had been 
picked out of the wealth of material gathered by the prosecution and the Israeli police Obviously 
the defense had received the crumbs from the rich mans table In fact it had neither the means 
nor the time to conduct the affair properly it did not have at its disposal the archives of the world 
and the instruments of government The same reproach had been leveled against the 
Nuremberg Trials where the inequality of status between prosecution and defense was even 
more glaring The chief handicap of the defense at Nuremberg as at Jerusalem was that it 
lacked the staff of trained research assistants needed to go through the mass of documents and 
find whatever might be useful in the case Even today eighteen years after the war our 
knowledge of the immense archival material of the Nazi regime rests to a large extent on the 
selection made for purposes of prosecution 
No one could have been more aware of this decisive disadvantage for the defense than Dr 
Servatius who was one of the defense counsels at Nuremberg Which obviously makes the 
question of why he offered his services to begin with even more intriguing His answer to this 
question was that for him this was a mere business matter and that he wished to make 
money but he must have known from his Nuremberg experience that the sum paid him by the 
Israeli governmenttwenty thousand dollars as he himself had stipulated  was ridiculously 
inadequate even though Eichmanns family in Linz had given him another fifteen thousand 
marks He began complaining about being underpaid almost the first day of the trial and soon 
thereafter he openly voiced the hope that he would be able to sell whatever memoirs Eichmann 
would write in prison for future generations Leaving aside the question of whether such a 
business deal would have been proper his hopes were disappointed because the Israeli 
government confiscated all papers written by Eichmann while in jail They have now been 
deposited in the National Archives Eichmann had written a book in the time between the 
adjournment of the court in August and the pronouncement of judgment in December and the 
defense offered it as new factual evidence in the revision proceedings before the Court of 
Appeal  which of course the newly written book was not 
As to the position of the defendant the court could rely upon the detailed statement he had made 
to the Israeli police examiner supplemented by many handwritten notes he had handed in during 
the eleven months needed for the preparation of the trial No doubt was ever raised that these 
were voluntary statements most of them had not even been elicited by questions Eichmann had 
been confronted with sixteen hundred documents some of which it turned out he must have 
seen before because they had been shown to him in Argentina during his interview with Sassen 
which Mr Hausner with some justification called a dress rehearsal But he had started working 
on them seriously only in Jerusalem and when he was put on the stand it soon became 
apparent that he had not wasted his time now he knew how to read documents something he 
had not known during the police examination and he could do it better than his lawyer 
Eichmanns testimony in court turned out to be the most important evidence in the case His 
counsel put him on the stand on June  during the seventyfifth session and interrogated him 
almost uninterruptedly for fourteen sessions until July  
 
That same day during the eightyeighth session the crossexamination by the prosecution 
began and it lasted for another seventeen sessions up to the twentieth of July There were a few 
incidents Eichmann once threatened to confess everything Moscow style and he once 
complained that he had been grilled until the steak was done but he was usually quite calm and 

he was not serious when he threatened that he would refuse to answer any more questions He 
told Judge Halevi how pleased he was at this opportunity to sift the truth from the untruths that 
had been unloaded upon him for fifteen years and how proud of being the subject of a cross
examination that lasted longer than any known before After a short reexamination by his lawyer 
which took less than a session he was examined by the three judges and they got more out of 
him in two and a half short sessions than the prosecution had been able to elicit in seventeen 
Eichmann was on the stand from June  to July  or a total of thirtythree and a half sessions 
Almost twice as many sessions sixtytwo out of a total of a hundred and twentyone were spent 
on a hundred prosecution witnesses who country after country told their tales of horrors Their 
testimony lasted from April  to June  the entire intervening time being taken up with the 
submission of documents most of which the Attorney General read into the record of the courts 
proceedings which was handed out to the press each day All but a mere handful of the 
witnesses were Israeli citizens and they had been picked from hundreds and hundreds of 
applicants Ninety of them were survivors in the strict sense of the word they had survived the 
war in one form or another of Nazi captivity How much wiser it would have been to resist these 
pressures altogether it was done up to a point for none of the potential witnesses mentioned in 
Minister of Death written by Quentin Reynolds on the basis of material provided by two Israeli 
journalists and published in  was ever called to the stand and to seek out those who had 
not volunteered As though to prove the point the prosecution called upon a writer well known on 
both sides of the Atlantic under the name of KZetnik  a slang word for a concentrationcamp 
inmate  as the author of several books on Auschwitz that dealt with brothels homosexuals and 
other human interest stories He started off as he had done at many of his public appearances 
with an explanation of his adopted name It was not a penname he said I must carry this 
name as long as the world will not awaken after the crucifying of the nation    as humanity has 
risen after the crucifixion of one man He continued with a little excursion into astrology the star 
influencing our fate in the same way as the star of ashes at Auschwitz is there facing our planet 
radiating toward our planet And when he had arrived at the unnatural power above Nature 
which had sustained him thus far and now for the first time paused to catch his breath even Mr 
Hausner felt that something had to be done about this testimony and very timidly very politely 
interrupted Could I perhaps put a few questions to you if you will consent Whereupon the 
presiding judge saw his chance as well Mr Dinoor please please listen to Mr Hausner and to 
me In response the disappointed witness probably deeply wounded fainted and answered no 
more questions 
This to be sure was an exception but if it was an exception that proved the rule of normality it 
did not prove the rule of simplicity or of ability to tell a story let alone of the rare capacity for 
distinguishing between things that had happened to the storyteller more than sixteen and 
sometimes twenty years ago and what he had read and heard and imagined in the meantime 
These difficulties could not be helped but they were not improved by the predilection of the 
prosecution for witnesses of some prominence many of whom had published books about their 
experiences and who now told what they had previously written or what they had told and retold 
many times The procession started in a futile attempt to proceed according to chronological 
order with eight witnesses from Germany all of them sober enough but they were not 
survivors they had been highranking Jewish officials in Germany and were now prominent in 
Israeli public life and they had all left Germany prior to the outbreak of war They were followed 
by five witnesses from Prague and then by just one witness from Austria on which country the 
prosecution had submitted the valuable reports of the late Dr Lwenherz written during and 
shortly after the end of the war There appeared one witness each from France Holland 
Denmark Norway Luxembourg Italy Greece and Soviet Russia two from Yugoslavia three 
each from Rumania and Slovakia and thirteen from Hungary But the bulk of the witnesses fifty
three came from Poland and Lithuania where Eichmanns competence and authority had been 
almost nil Belgium and Bulgaria were the only countries not covered by witnesses These were 
all background witnesses and so were the sixteen men and women who told the court about 
Auschwitz ten and Treblinka four about Chelmno and Majdanek It was different with those 
who testified on Theresienstadt the oldage ghetto on Reich territory the only camp in which 
Eichmanns power had indeed been considerable there were four witnesses for Theresienstadt 
and one for the exchange camp at BergenBelsen 

At the end of this procession the right of the witnesses to be irrelevant as Yad Vashem 
summing up the testimony in its Bulletin phrased it was so firmly established that it was a mere 
formality when Mr Hausner during the seventythird session asked permission of the court to 
complete his picture and Judge Landau who some fifty sessions before had protested so 
strenuously against this picture painting agreed immediately to the appearance of a former 
member of the Jewish Brigade the fighting force of Palestine Jews that had been attached to the 
British Eighth Army during the war This last witness for the prosecution Mr Aharon HoterYishai 
now an Israeli lawyer had been assigned the task of coordinating all efforts to search for Jewish 
survivors in Europe under the auspices of Aliyah Beth the organisation responsible for arranging 
for illegal immigration into Palestine The surviving Jews were dispersed among some eight 
million displaced persons from all over Europe a floating mass of humanity that the Allies wanted 
to repatriate as quickly as possible The danger was that the Jews too would be returned to their 
former homes Mr HoterYishai told how he and his comrades were greeted when they presented 
themselves as members of the Jewish fighting nation and how it was sufficient to draw a Star 
of David on a sheet in ink and pin it to a broomstick to shake these people out of the dangerous 
apathy of nearstarvation He also told how some of them had wandered home from the DP 
camps only to come back to another camp for home was for instance a small Polish town 
where of six thousand former Jewish inhabitants fifteen had survived and where four of these 
survivors had been murdered upon their return by the Poles He described finally how he and the 
others had tried to forestall the repatriation attempts of the Allies and how they frequently arrived 
too late In Theresienstadt there were thirtytwo thousand survivors After a few weeks we found 
only four thousand About twentyeight thousand had returned or been returned Those four 
thousand whom we found there  of them of course not one person returned to his place of 
origin because in the meantime the road was pointed out to them  that is the road to what was 
then Palestine and was soon to become Israel This testimony perhaps smacked more strongly of 
propaganda than anything heard previously and the presentation of the facts was indeed 
misleading In November  after the last shipment had left Theresienstadt for Auschwitz 
there were only about ten thousand of the original inmates left In February  there arrived 
another six to eight thousand people the Jewish partners of mixed marriages whom the Nazis 
shipped to Theresienstadt at a moment when the whole German transportation system was 
already in a state of collapse All the others  roughly fifteen thousand  had poured in in open 
freight cars or on foot in April  after the camp had been taken over by the Red Cross 
These were survivors of Auschwitz members of the labor gangs and they were chiefly from 
Poland and Hungary When the Russians liberated the camp  on May    many Czech 
Jews who had been in Theresienstadt since the beginning left the camp immediately and started 
home they were in their own country When the quarantine ordered by the Russians because of 
the epidemics was lifted the majority left on its own initiative So that the remnant found by the 
Palestine emissaries probably consisted of people who could not return or be returned for various 
reasons  the ill the aged single lonely survivors of families who did not know where to turn And 
yet Mr HoterYishai told the simple truth those who had survived the ghettos and the camps 
who had come out alive from the nightmare of absolute helplessness and abandonment  as 
though the whole world was a jungle and they its prey  had only one wish to go where they 
would never see a nonJew again They needed the emissaries of the Jewish people in Palestine 
in order to learn that they could come legally or illegally by hook or by crook and that they would 
be welcome they did not need them in order to be convinced 
Thus every once in a long while one was glad that Judge Landau had lost his battle and the first 
such moment occurred even before the battle had started For Mr Hausners first background 
witness did not look as though he had volunteered He was an old man wearing the traditional 
Jewish skullcap small very frail with sparse white hair and beard holding himself quite erect in 
a sense his name was famous and one understood why the prosecution wanted to begin its 
picture with him He was Zindel Grynszpan father of Herschel Grynszpan who on November  
 at the age of seventeen had walked up to the German embassy in Paris and shot to death 
its third secretary the young Legationsrat Ernst vom Rath The assassination had triggered the 
pogroms in Germany and Austria the socalled Kristallnacht of November  which was indeed a 
prelude to the Final Solution but with whose preparation Eichmann had nothing to do The 
motives for Grynszpans act have never been cleared up and his brother whom the prosecution 

also put on the stand was remarkably reluctant to talk about it The court took it for granted that it 
was an act of vengeance for the expulsion of some seventeen thousand Polish Jews the 
Grynszpan family among them from German territory during the last days of October  but it 
is generally known that this explanation is unlikely Herschel Grynszpan was a psychopath 
unable to finish school who for years had knocked about Paris and Brussels being expelled from 
both places His lawyer in the French court that tried him introduced a confused story of 
homosexual relations and the Germans who later had him extradited never put him on trial 
There are rumors that he survived the war  as though to substantiate the paradox of Auschwitz 
that those Jews who had committed a criminal offense were spared Vom Rath was a singularly 
inadequate victim he had been shadowed by the Gestapo because of his openly antiNazi views 
and his sympathy for Jews the story of his homosexuality was probably fabricated by the 
Gestapo Grynszpan might have acted as an unwitting tool of Gestapo agents in Paris who could 
have wanted to kill two birds with one stone  create a pretext for pogroms in Germany and get rid 
of an opponent to the Nazi regime  without realizing that they could not have it both ways that is 
could not slander vom Rath as a homosexual having illicit relations with Jewish boys and also 
make of him a martyr and a victim of world Jewry 
However that may have been it is a fact that the Polish government in the fall of  decreed 
that all Polish Jews residing in Germany would lose their nationality by October  it probably 
was in possession of information that the German government intended to expel these Jews to 
Poland and wanted to prevent this It is more than doubtful that people like Mr Zindel Grynszpan 
even knew that such a decree existed He had come to Germany in  a young man of 
twentyfive to open a grocery store in Hanover where in due time eight children were born to 
him In  when catastrophe overcame him he had been living in Germany for twentyseven 
years and like many such people he had never bothered to change his papers and to ask for 
naturalization Now he had come to tell his story carefully answering questions put to him by the 
prosecutor he spoke clearly and firmly without embroidery using a minimum of words 
On the twentyseventh of October  it was a Thursday night at eight oclock a policeman 
came and told us to come to Region police station Eleven He said You are going to come 
back immediately dont take anything with you only your passports  Grynszpan went with his 
family a son a daughter and his wife When they arrived at the police station he saw a large 
number of people some sitting some standing people were crying They the police were 
shouting Sign sign sign    I had to sign all of them did One of us did not his name was I 
believe Gershon Silber and he had to stand in the corner for twentyfour hours They took us to 
the concert hall and    there were people from all over town about six hundred people There 
we stayed until Friday night about twentyfour hours yes until Friday night    Then they took 
us in police trucks in prisoners lorries about twenty men in each truck and they took us to the 
railroad station The streets were black with people shouting Juden raus to Palestine    They 
took us by train to Neubenschen on the GermanPolish border It was Shabbat morning when we 
arrived there six oclock in the morning There came trains from all sorts of places from Leipzig 
Cologne Dsseldorf Essen Biederfeld Bremen Together we were about twelve thousand 
people It was the Shabbat the twentyninth of October    When we reached the border we 
were searched to see if anybody had any money and anybody who had more than ten marks  
the balance was taken away This was the German law no more than ten marks could be taken 
out of Germany The Germans said You didnt bring any more with you when you came you 
cant take out any more  They had to walk a little over a mile to the Polish border since the 
Germans intended to smuggle them into Polish territory The SS men were whipping us those 
who lingered they hit and blood was flowing on the road They tore away our suitcases from us 
they treated us in a most brutal way this was the first time that Id seen the wild brutality of the 
Germans They shouted at us Run Run I was hit and fell into the ditch My son helped me and 
he said Run Father run or youll die When we got to the open border  the women went in 
first The Poles knew nothing They called a Polish general and some officers who examined our 
papers and they saw that we were Polish citizens that we had special passports It was decided 
to let us enter They took us to a village of about six thousand people and we were twelve 
thousand The rain was driving hard people were fainting  on all sides one saw old men and 
women Our suffering was great There was no food since Thursday we had not eaten    They 
were taken to a military camp and put into stables as there was no room elsewhere    I think it 

was our second day in Poland On the first day a lorry with bread came from Poznan that was 
on Sunday And then I wrote a letter to France    to my son Dont write any more letters to 
Germany We are now in Zbaszyn  
This story took no more than perhaps ten minutes to tell and when it was over  the senseless 
needless destruction of twentyseven years in less than twentyfour hours  one thought foolishly 
Everyone everyone should have his day in court Only to find out in the endless sessions that 
followed how difficult it was to tell the story that  at least outside the transforming realm of 
poetry  it needed a purity of soul an unmirrored unreflected innocence of heart and mind that 
only the righteous possess No one either before or after was to equal the shining honesty of 
Zindel Grynszpan 
No one could claim that Grynszpans testimony created anything remotely resembling a dramatic 
moment But such a moment came a few weeks later and it came unexpectedly just when 
Judge Landau was making an almost desperate attempt to bring the proceedings back under the 
control of normal criminalcourt procedures On the stand was Abba Kovner a poet and an 
author who had not so much testified as addressed an audience with the ease of someone who 
is used to speaking in public and resents interruptions from the floor He had been asked by the 
presiding judge to be brief which he obviously disliked and Mr Hausner who had defended his 
witness had been told that he could not complain about a lack of patience on the part of the 
court which of course he did not like either At this slightly tense moment the witness happened 
to mention the name of Anton Schmidt a Feldwebel or sergeant in the German Army  a name 
that was not entirely unknown to this audience for Yad Vashem had published Schmidts story 
some years before in its Hebrew Bulletin and a number of Yiddish papers in America had picked 
it up Anton Schmidt was in charge of a patrol in Poland that collected stray German soldiers who 
were cut off from their units In the course of doing this he had run into members of the Jewish 
underground including Mr Kovner a prominent member and he had helped the Jewish 
partisans by supplying them with forged papers and military trucks Most important of all He did 
not do it for money This had gone on for five months from October  to March  when 
Anton Schmidt was arrested and executed The prosecution had elicited the story because 
Kovner declared that he had first heard the name of Eichmann from Schmidt who had told him 
about rumors in the Army that it was Eichmann who arranges everything 
This was by no means the first time that help from the outside nonJewish world had been 
mentioned Judge Halevi had been asking the witnesses Did the Jews get any help with the 
same regularity as that with which the prosecution had asked Why did you not rebel The 
answers had been various and inconclusive  We had the whole population against us Jews 
hidden by Christian families could be counted on the fingers of one hand perhaps five or six out 
of a total of thirteen thousand  but on the whole the situation had surprisingly been better in 
Poland than in any other Eastern European country There was I have said no testimony on 
Bulgaria A Jew now married to a Polish woman and living in Israel testified how his wife had 
hidden him and twelve other Jews throughout the war another had a Christian friend from before 
the war to whom he had escaped from a camp and who had helped him and who was later 
executed because of the help he had given to Jews One witness claimed that the Polish 
underground had supplied many Jews with weapons and had saved thousands of Jewish children 
by placing them with Polish families The risks were prohibitive there was the story of an entire 
Polish family who had been executed in the most brutal manner because they had adopted a six
yearold Jewish girl But this mention of Schmidt was the first and the last time that any such story 
was told of a German for the only other incident involving a German was mentioned only in a 
document an Army officer had helped indirectly by sabotaging certain police orders nothing 
happened to him but the matter had been thought sufficiently serious to be mentioned in 
correspondence between Himmler and Bormann 
During the few minutes it took Kovner to tell of the help that had come from a German sergeant a 
hush settled over the courtroom it was as though the crowd had spontaneously decided to 
observe the usual two minutes of silence in honor of the man named Anton Schmidt And in those 
two minutes which were like a sudden burst of light in the midst of impenetrable unfathomable 
darkness a single thought stood out clearly irrefutably beyond question  how utterly different 
everything would be today in this courtroom in Israel in Germany in all of Europe and perhaps 
in all countries of the world if only more such stories could have been told 

There are of course explanations of this devastating shortage and they have been repeated 
many times I shall give the gist of them in the words of one of the few subjectively sincere 
memoirs of the war published in Germany Peter Bamm a German Army physician who served at 
the Russian front tells in Die Unsichtbare Flagge  of the killing of Jews in Sevastopol They 
were collected by the others as he calls the SS mobile killing units to distinguish them from 
ordinary soldiers whose decency the book extols and were put into a sealedoff part of the 
former GPU prison that abutted on the officers lodgings where Bamms own unit was 
quartered They were then made to board a mobile gas van in which they died after a few 
minutes whereupon the driver transported the corpses outside the city and unloaded them into 
tank ditches We knew this We did nothing Anyone who had seriously protested or done 
anything against the killing unit would have been arrested within twentyfour hours and would 
have disappeared It belongs among the refinements of totalitarian governments in our century 
that they dont permit their opponents to die a great dramatic martyrs death for their convictions 
A good many of us might have accepted such a death The totalitarian state lets its opponents 
disappear in silent anonymity It is certain that anyone who had dared to suffer death rather than 
silently tolerate the crime would have sacrificed his life in vain This is not to say that such a 
sacrifice would have been morally meaningless It would only have been practically useless 
None of us had a conviction so deeply rooted that we could have taken upon ourselves a 
practically useless sacrifice for the sake of a higher moral meaning Needless to add the writer 
remains unaware of the emptiness of his much emphasized decency in the absence of what he 
calls a higher moral meaning 
But the hollowness of respectability  for decency under such circumstances is no more than 
respectability  was not what became apparent in the example afforded by Sergeant Anton 
Schmidt Rather it was the fatal flaw in the argument itself which at first sounds so hopelessly 
plausible It is true that totalitarian domination tried to establish these holes of oblivion into which 
all deeds good and evil would disappear but just as the Nazis feverish attempts from June 
 on to erase all traces of the massacres  through cremation through burning in open pits 
through the use of explosives and flamethrowers and bonecrushing machinery  were doomed 
to failure so all efforts to let their opponents disappear in silent anonymity were in vain The 
holes of oblivion do not exist Nothing human is that  perfect and there are simply too many 
people in the world to make oblivion possible One man will always be left alive to tell the story 
Hence nothing can ever be practically useless at least not in the long run It would be of great 
practical usefulness for Germany today not merely for her prestige abroad but for her sadly 
confused inner condition if there were more such stories to be told For the lesson of such stories 
is simple and within everybodys grasp Politically speaking it is that under conditions of terror 
most people will comply but some people will not just as the lesson of the countries to which the 
Final Solution was proposed is that it could happen in most places but it did not happen 
everywhere Humanly speaking no more is required and no more can reasonably be asked for 
this planet to remain a place fit for human habitation 
 
 
 
XV  Judgment Appeal and Execution 
 
 
Eichmann spent the last months of the war cooling his heels in Berlin with nothing to do cut by 
the other department heads in the RSHA who had lunch together every day in the building 
where he had his office but did not once ask him to join them He kept himself busy with his 
defense installations so as to be ready for the last battle for Berlin and as his only official duty 
paid occasional visits to Theresienstadt where he showed Red Cross delegates around To 
them of all people he unburdened his soul about Himmlers new humane line in regard to the 
Jews which included an avowed determination to have next time concentration camps after 
the English model In April  Eichmann had the last of his rare interviews with Himmler 
who ordered him to select a hundred to two hundred prominent Jews in Theresienstadt 
transport them to Austria and install them in hotels so that Himmler could use them as 
hostages in his forthcoming negotiations with Eisenhower The absurdity of this commission 

seems not to have dawned upon Eichmann he went with grief in my heart as I had to desert 
my defense installations but he never reached Theresienstadt because all the roads were 
blocked by the approaching Russian armies Instead he ended up at AltAussee in Austria 
where Kaltenbrunner had taken refuge Kaltenbrunner had no interest in Himmlers prominent 
Jews and told Eichmann to organize a commando for partisan warfare in the Austrian 
mountains Eichmann responded with the greatest enthusiasm This was again something worth 
doing a task I enjoyed But just as he had collected some hundred more or less unfit men most 
of whom had never seen a rifle and had taken possession of an arsenal of abandoned weapons 
of all sorts he received the latest Himmler order No fire is to be opened on English and 
Americans This was the end He sent his men home and gave a small strongbox containing 
paper money and gold coins to his trusted legal adviser Regierungsrat Hunsche Because I 
said to myself he is a man from the higher civil services he will be correct in the management of 
funds he will put down his expenses    for I still believed that accounts would be demanded 
some day 
 
With these words Eichmann had to conclude the autobiography he had spontaneously given the 
police examiner It had taken only a few days and filled no more than  of the  pages 
copied off the taperecorder He would like to have gone on and he obviously did tell the rest of 
the story to the police but the trial authorities for various reasons had decided not to admit any 
testimony covering the time after the close of the war However from affidavits given at 
Nuremberg and more important from a much discussed indiscretion on the part of a former 
Israeli civil servant Moshe Pearlman whose book The Capture of Adolf Eichmann appeared in 
London four weeks before the trial opened it is possible to complete the story Mr Pearlmans 
account was obviously based upon material from Bureau  the police office that was in charge 
of the preparations for the trial Mr Pearlmans own version was that since he had retired from 
government service three weeks before Eichmann was kidnaped he had written the book as a 
private individual which is not very convincing because the Israeli police must have known of 
the impending capture several months before his retirement The book caused some 
embarrassment in Israel not only because Mr Pearlman had been able to divulge information 
about important prosecution documents prematurely and had stated that the trial authorities had 
already made up their minds about the untrustworthiness of Eichmanns testimony but because a 
reliable account of how Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires was of course the last thing they 
wanted to have published 
The story told by Mr Pearlman was considerably less exciting than the various rumors upon 
which previous tales had been based Eichmann had never been in the Near East or the Middle 
East he had no connection with any Arab country he had never returned to Germany from 
Argentina he had never been to any other Latin American country he had played no role in 
postwar Nazi activities or organizations At the end of the war he had tried to speak once more 
with Kaltenbrunner who was still in AltAussee playing solitaire but his former chief was in no 
mood to receive him since for this man he saw no chances any more Kaltenbrunners own 
chances were not so very good either he was hanged at Nuremberg Almost immediately 
thereafter Eichmann was caught by American soldiers and put in a camp for SS men where 
numerous interrogations failed to uncover his identity although it was known to some of his 
fellowprisoners He was cautious and did not write to his family but let them believe he was 
dead his wife tried to obtain a death certificate but failed when it was discovered that the only 
eyewitness to her husbands death was her brotherinlaw She had been left penniless but 
Eichmanns family in Linz supported her and the three children 
In November  the trials of the major war criminals opened in Nuremberg and Eichmanns 
name began to appear with uncomfortable regularity In January  Wisliceny appeared as a 
witness for the prosecution and gave his damning evidence whereupon Eichmann decided that 
he had better disappear He escaped from the camp with the help of the inmates and went to 
the Lneburger Heide a heath about fifty miles south of Hamburg where the brother of one of his 
fellowprisoners provided him with work as a lumberjack He stayed there under the name of Otto 
Heninger for four years and he was probably bored to death Early in  he succeeded in 
establishing contact with ODESSA a clandestine organization of SS veterans and in May of 
that year he was passed through Austria to Italy where a Franciscan priest fully informed of his 

identity equipped him with a refugee passport in the name of Richard Klement and sent him on to 
Buenos Aires He arrived in midJuly and without any difficulty obtained identification papers and 
a work permit as Ricardo Klement Catholic a bachelor stateless aged thirtysevenseven years 
less than his real age 
He was still cautious but he now wrote to his wife in his own handwriting and told her that her 
childrens uncle was alive He worked at a number of odd jobssales representative laundry 
man worker on a rabbit farm  all poorly paid but in the summer of  he had his wife and 
children join him Mrs Eichmann obtained a German passport in Zurich Switzerland though she 
was a resident of Austria at the time and under her real name as a divorcee from a certain 
Eichmann How this came about has remained a mystery and the file containing her application 
has disappeared from the German consulate in Zurich Upon her arrival in Argentina Eichmann 
got his first steady job in the MercedesBenz factory in Suarez a suburb of Buenos Aires first as 
a mechanic and later as a foreman and when a fourth son was born to him he remarried his 
wife supposedly under the name of Klement This is not likely however for the infant was 
registered as Ricardo Francisco presumably as a tribute to the Italian priest Klement Eichmann 
and this was only one of many hints that Eichmann dropped in regard to his identity as the years 
went by It does seem to be true however that he told his children he was Adolf Eichmanns 
brother though the children being well acquainted with their grandparents and uncles in Linz 
must have been rather dull to believe it the oldest son at least who had been nine years old 
when he last saw his father should have been able to recognize him seven years later in 
Argentina Mrs Eichmanns Argentine identity card moreover was never changed it read 
Veronika Liebl de Eichmann and in  when Eichmanns stepmother died and a year later 
when his father died the newspaper announcements in Linz carried Mrs Eichmanns name 
among the survivors contradicting all stories of divorce and remarriage Early in  a few 
months before his capture Eichmann and his elder sons finished building a primitive brick house 
in one of the poor suburbs of Buenos Aires  no electricity no running water  where the family 
settled down They must have been very poor and Eichmann must have led a dreary life for 
which not even the children could compensate for they showed absolutely no interest in being 
educated and did not even try to develop their socalled talents 
Eichmanns only compensation consisted in talking endlessly with members of the large Nazi 
colony to whom he readily admitted his identity In  this finally led to the interview with the 
Dutch journalist Willem S Sassen a former member of the Armed SS who had exchanged his 
Dutch nationality for a German passport during the war and had later been condemned to death 
in absentia in Belgium as a war criminal 
Eichmann made copious notes for the interview which was taperecorded and then rewritten by 
Sassen with considerable embellishments the notes in Eichmanns own handwriting were 
discovered and they were admitted as evidence at his trial though the statement as a whole was 
not Sassens version appeared in abbreviated form first in the German illustrated magazine Der 
Stern in July  and then in November and December as a series of articles in Life But 
Sassen obviously with Eichmanns consent had offered the story four years before to a Time
Life correspondent in Buenos Aires and even if it is true that Eichmanns name was withheld the 
content of the material could have left no doubt about the original source of the information The 
truth of the matter is that Eichmann had made many efforts to break out of his anonymity and it is 
rather strange that it took the Israeli Secret Services several years  until August   to learn 
that Adolf Eichmann was living in Argentina under the name of Ricardo Klement Israel has never 
divulged the source of her information and today at least half a dozen persons claim they found 
Eichmann while wellinformed circles in Europe insist that it was the Russian Intelligence 
service that spilled the news However that may have been the puzzle is not how it was possible 
to discover Eichmanns hideout but rather how it was possible not to discover it earlier  
provided of course that the Israelis had indeed pursued this search through the years Which in 
view of the facts seems doubtful 
No doubt however exists about the identity of the captors All talk of private avengers was 
contradicted at the outset by BenGurion himself who on May   announced to Israels 
wildly cheering Knesset that Eichmann had been found by the Israeli Secret Service Dr 
Servatius who tried strenuously and unsuccessfully both before the District Court and before the 
Court of Appeal to call Zvi Tohar chief pilot of the ElAl plane that flew Eichmann out of the 

country and Yad Shimoni an official of the air line in Argentina as witnesses mentioned Ben
Gurions statement the Attorney General countered by saying that the Prime Minister had 
admitted no more than that Eichmann was found out by the Secret Service not that he also had 
been kidnaped by government agents Well in actual fact it seems that it was the other way 
round Secret Service men had not found him but only picked him up after making a few 
preliminary tests to assure themselves that the information they had received was true And even 
this was not done very expertly for Eichmann had been well aware that he was being shadowed 
I told you that months ago I believe when I was asked if I had known that I was found out and I 
could give you then precise reasons that is in the part of the police examination that was not 
released to the press    I learned that people in my neighborhood had made inquiries about 
realestate purchases and so on and so forth for the establishment of a factory for sewing 
machines  a thing that was quite impossible since there existed neither electricity nor water in 
that area Furthermore I was informed that these people were Jews from North America I could 
easily have disappeared but I did not do it I just went on as usual and let things catch up with 
me I could have found employment without any difficulty with my papers and references But I 
did not want that 
There was more proof than was revealed in Jerusalem of his willingness to go to Israel and stand 
trial Counsel for the defense of course had to stress the fact that after all the accused had 
been kidnaped and brought to Israel in conflict with international law because this enabled the 
defense to challenge the right of the court to prosecute him and though neither the prosecution 
nor the judges ever admitted that the kidnaping had been an act of state they did not deny it 
either They argued that the breach of international law concerned only the states of Argentina 
and Israel not the rights of the defendant and that this breach was cured through the joint 
declaration of the two governments on August   that they resolved to view as settled the 
incident which was caused in the wake of the action of citizens of Israel which violated the basic 
rights of the State of Argentina The court decided that it did not matter whether these Israelis 
were government agents or private citizens What neither the defense nor the court mentioned 
was that Argentina would not have waived her rights so obligingly had Eichmann been an 
Argentine citizen He had lived there under an assumed name thereby denying himself the right 
to government protection at least as Ricardo Klement born on May   at Bolzano  in 
Southern Tyrol  as his Argentine identity card stated although he had declared himself of 
German nationality And he had never invoked the dubious right of asylum which would not 
have helped him anyhow since Argentina although she has in fact offered asylum to many 
known Nazi criminals had signed an International Convention declaring that the perpetrators of 
crimes against humanity will not be deemed to be political criminals All this did not make 
Eichmann stateless it did not legally deprive him of his German nationality but it gave the West 
German republic a welcome pretext for withholding the customary protection due its citizens 
abroad In other words and despite pages and pages of legal argument based on so many 
precedents that one finally got the impression that kidnaping was among the most frequent 
modes of arrest it was Eichmanns de facto statelessness and nothing else that enabled the 
Jerusalem court to sit in judgment on him Eichmann though no legal expert should have been 
able to appreciate that for he knew from his own career that one could do as one pleased only 
with stateless people the Jews had had to lose their nationality before they could be 
exterminated But he was in no mood to ponder such niceties for if it was a fiction that he had 
come voluntarily to Israel to stand trial it was true that he had made fewer difficulties than 
anybody had expected In fact he had made none 
On May   at sixthirty in the evening when Eichmann alighted as usual from the bus 
that brought him home from his place of work he was seized by three men and in less than a 
minute bundled into a waiting car which took him to a previously rented house in a remote 
suburb of Buenos Aires No drugs no ropes no handcuffs were used and Eichmann immediately 
recognized that this was professional work as no unnecessary violence had been applied he 
was not hurt Asked who he was he instantly said Ich bin Adolf Eichmann and surprisingly 
added I know I am in the hands of Israelis He later explained that he had read in some 
newspaper of BenGurions order that he be found and caught For eight days while the Israelis 
were waiting for the ElAl plane that was to carry them and their prisoner to Israel Eichmann was 
tied to a bed which was the only aspect of the whole affair that he complained about and on the 

second day of his captivity he was asked to state in writing that he had no objection to being tried 
by an Israeli court The statement was of course already prepared and all he was supposed to 
do was to copy it To everybodys surprise however he insisted on writing his own text for 
which as can be seen from the following lines he probably used the first sentences of the 
prepared statement I the undersigned Adolf Eichmann hereby declare out of my own free will 
that since now my true identity has been revealed I see clearly that it is useless to try and escape 
judgment any longer I hereby express my readiness to travel to Israel to face a court of 
judgment an authorized court of law It is clear and understood that I shall be given legal advice 
thus far he probably copied and I shall try to write down the facts of my last years of public 
activities in Germany without any embellishments in order that future generations will have a 
true picture This declaration I declare out of my own free will not for promises given and not 
because of threats I wish to be at peace with myself at last Since I cannot remember all the 
details and since I seem to mix up facts I request assistance by putting at my disposal 
documents and affidavits to help me in my effort to seek the truth Signed Adolf Eichmann 
Buenos Aires May  This document though doubtless genuine has one peculiarity its 
date omits the day it was signed The omission gives rise to the suspicion that the letter was 
written not in Argentina but in Jerusalem where Eichmann arrived on May  The letter was 
needed less for the trial during which the prosecution did submit it as evidence but without 
attaching much importance to it than for Israels first explanatory official note to the Argentine 
government to which it was duly attached Servatius who asked Eichmann about the letter in 
court did not mention the peculiarity of the date and Eichmann could not very well mention it 
himself since upon being asked a leading question by his lawyer he confirmed though 
somewhat reluctantly that he had given the statement under duress while tied to the bed in the 
Buenos Aires suburb The prosecutor who may have known better did not crossexamine him on 
this point clearly the less said about this matter the better Mrs Eichmann had notified the 
Argentine police of her husbands disappearance but without revealing his identity so no check 
of railway stations highways and airfields was made The Israelis were lucky they would never 
have been able to spirit Eichmann out of the country ten days after his capture if the police had 
been properly alerted 
Eichmann provided two reasons for his astounding cooperation with the trial authorities Even 
the judges who insisted that Eichmann was simply a liar had to admit that they knew no answer to 
the question Why did the accused confess before Superintendent Less to a number of 
incriminating details of which on the face of it there could be no proof but for his confession in 
particular to his journeys to the East where he saw the atrocities with his own eyes In 
Argentina years before his capture he had written how tired he was of his anonymity and the 
more he read about himself the more tired he must have become His second explanation given 
in Israel was more dramatic About a year and a half ago ie in the spring of  I heard 
from an acquaintance who had just returned from a trip to Germany that a certain feeling of guilt 
had seized some sections of German youth    and the fact of this guilt complex was for me as 
much of a landmark as let us say the landing of the first manbearing rocket on the moon It 
became an essential point of my inner life around which many thoughts crystallized This was 
why I did not escape  when I knew the search commando was closing in on me  After these 
conversations about the guilt feeling among young people in Germany which made such a deep 
impression on me I felt I no longer had the right to disappear This is also why I offered in a 
written statement at the beginning of this examination    to hang myself in public I wanted to do 
my part in lifting the burden of guilt from German youth for these young people are after all 
innocent of the events and of the acts of their fathers during the last war  which incidentally 
he was still calling in another context a war forced upon the German Reich Of course all this 
was empty talk What prevented him from returning to Germany of his own free will to give 
himself up He was asked this question and he replied that in his opinion German courts still 
lacked the objectivity needed for dealing with people like him But if he did prefer to be tried by 
an Israeli court  as he somehow implied and which was just barely possible  he could have 
spared the Israeli government much time and trouble We have seen before that this kind of talk 
gave him feelings of elation and indeed it kept him in something approaching good spirits 
throughout his stay in the Israeli prison It even enabled him to look upon death with remarkable 
equanimity  I know that the death sentence is in store for me he declared at the beginning of 

the police examination 
There was some truth behind the empty talk and the truth emerged quite clearly when the 
question of his defense was put to him For obvious reasons the Israeli government had decided 
to admit a foreign counselor and on July   six weeks after the police examination had 
started with Eichmanns explicit consent he was informed that there were three possible 
counselors among whom he might choose in arranging his defense  Dr Robert Servatius who 
was recommended by his family Servatius had offered his services in a longdistance call to 
Eichmanns stepbrother in Linz another German lawyer now residing in Chile and an American 
law firm in New York which had contacted the trial authorities Only Dr Servatius name was 
divulged There might of course be other possibilities which Eichmann was entitled to explore 
and he was told repeatedly that he could take his time He did nothing of the sort but said on the 
spur of the moment that he would like to retain Dr Servatius since he seemed to be an 
acquaintance of his stepbrother and also had defended other war criminals and he insisted on 
signing the necessary papers immediately Half an hour later it occurred to him that the trial 
could assume global dimensions that it might become a monster process that there were 
several attorneys for the prosecution and that Servatius alone would hardly be able to digest all 
the material He was reminded that Servatius in a letter asking for power of attorney had said 
that he would lead a group of attorneys he never did and the police officer added It must be 
assumed that Dr Servatius wont appear alone That would be a physical impossibility But Dr 
Servatius as it turned out appeared quite alone most of the time The result of all this was that 
Eichmann became the chief assistant to his own defense counsel and quite apart from writing 
books for future generations worked very hard throughout the trial 
 
On June   ten weeks after the opening of the trial on April  the prosecution rested its 
case and Dr Servatius opened the case for the defense on August  after a hundred and 
fourteen sessions the main proceedings came to an end The court then adjourned for four 
months and reassembled on December  to pronounce judgment For two days divided into 
five sessions the three judges read the two hundred and fortyfour sections of the judgment 
Dropping the prosecutions charge of conspiracy which would have made him a chief war 
criminal automatically responsible for everything which had to do with the Final Solution they 
convicted Eichmann on all fifteen counts of the indictment although he was acquitted on some 
particulars Together with others he had committed crimes against the Jewish people that is 
crimes against Jews with intent to destroy the people on four counts  by causing the killing of 
millions of Jews  by placing millions of Jews under conditions which were likely to lead to 
their physical destruction  by causing serious bodily and mental harm to them and  by 
directing that births be banned and pregnancies interrupted among Jewish women in 
Theresienstadt But they acquitted him of any such charges bearing on the period prior to August 
 when he was informed of the Fhrers order in his earlier activities in Berlin Vienna and 
Prague he had no intention to destroy the Jewish people These were the first four counts of 
the indictment Counts  through  dealt with crimes against humanity  a strange concept in 
the Israeli law inasmuch as it included both genocide if practiced against nonJewish peoples 
such as the Gypsies or the Poles and all other crimes including murder committed against 
either Jews or nonJews provided that these crimes were not committed with intent to destroy the 
people as a whole Hence everything Eichmann had done prior to the Fhrers order and all his 
acts against nonJews were lumped together as crimes against humanity to which were added 
once again all his later crimes against Jews since these were ordinary crimes as well The result 
was that Count  convicted him of the same crimes enumerated in Counts  and  and that 
Count  convicted him of having persecuted Jews on racial religious and political grounds 
Count  dealt with the plunder of property    linked with the murder    of these Jews and 
Count  summed up all these deeds again as war crimes since most of them had been 
committed during the war Counts  through  dealt with crimes against nonJews Count  
convicted him of the expulsion of    hundreds of thousands of Poles from their homes Count 
 of the expulsion of fourteen thousand Slovenes from Yugoslavia Count  of the deportation 
of scores of thousands of Gypsies to Auschwitz But the judgment held that it has not been 
proved before us that the accused knew that the Gypsies were being transported to destruction  
which meant that no genocide charge except the crime against the Jewish people was brought 

This was difficult to understand for apart from the fact that the extermination of Gypsies was 
common knowledge Eichmann had admitted during the police examination that he knew of it he 
had remembered vaguely that this had been an order from Himmler that no directives had 
existed for Gypsies as they existed for Jews and that there had been no research done on the 
Gypsy problem  origins customs habits organization    folklore    economy His 
department had been commissioned to undertake the evacuation of thirty thousand Gypsies 
from Reich territory and he could not remember the details very well because there had been no 
intervention from any side but that Gypsies like Jews were shipped off to be exterminated he 
had never doubted He was guilty of their extermination in exactly the same way he was guilty of 
the extermination of the Jews Count  concerned the deportation of ninetythree children from 
Lidice the Czech village whose inhabitants had been massacred after the assassination of 
Heydrich he was however rightly acquitted of the murder of these children The last three 
counts charged him with membership in three of the four organizations that the Nuremberg Trials 
had classified as criminal  the SS the Security Service or SD and the Secret State Police 
or Gestapo The fourth such organization the leadership corps of the National Socialist Party 
was not mentioned because Eichmann obviously had not been one of the Party leaders His 
membership in them prior to May  fell under the statute of limitations twenty years for 
minor offenses The Law of  under which Eichmann was tried specifies that there is no 
statute of limitation for major offenses and that the argument res judicata shall not avail  a 
person can be tried in Israel even if he has already been tried abroad whether before an 
international tribunal or a tribunal of a foreign state for the same offense All crimes enumerated 
under Counts  through  carried the death penalty 
Eichmann it will be remembered had steadfastly insisted that he was guilty only of aiding and 
abetting in the commission of the crimes with which he was charged that he himself had never 
committed an overt act The judgment to ones great relief in a way recognized that the 
prosecution had not succeeded in proving him wrong on this point For it was an important point 
it touched upon the very essence of this crime which was no ordinary crime and the very nature 
of this criminal who was no common criminal by implication it also took cognizance of the weird 
fact that in the death camps it was usually the inmates and the victims who had actually wielded 
the fatal instrument with their own hands What the judgment had to say on this point was 
more than correct it was the truth Expressing his activities in terms of Section  of our Criminal 
Code Ordinance we should say that they were mainly those of a person soliciting by giving 
counsel or advice to others and of one who enabled or aided others in the criminal act But in 
such an enormous and complicated crime as the one we are now considering wherein many 
people participated on various levels and in various modes of activity  the planners the 
organizers and those executing the deeds according to their various ranks  there is not much 
point in using the ordinary concepts of counseling and soliciting to commit a crime For these 
crimes were committed en masse not only in regard to the number of victims but also in regard 
to the numbers of those who perpetrated the crime and the extent to which any one of the many 
criminals was close to or remote from the actual killer of the victim means nothing as far as the 
measure of his responsibility is concerned On the contrary in general the degree of responsibility 
increases as we draw further away from the man who uses the fatal instrument with his own 
hands my italics 
What followed the reading of the judgment was routine Once more the prosecution rose to make 
a rather lengthy speech demanding the death penalty which in the absence of mitigating 
circumstances was mandatory and Dr Servatius replied even more briefly than before the 
accused had carried out acts of state what had happened to him might happen in future to 
anyone the whole civilized world faced this problem Eichmann was a scapegoat whom the 
present German government had abandoned to the court in Jerusalem contrary to international 
law in order to clear itself of responsibility The competence of the court never recognized by Dr 
Servatius could be construed only as trying the accused in a representative capacity as 
representing the legal powers vested in a German court  as indeed one German state 
prosecutor had formulated the task of Jerusalem Dr Servatius had argued earlier that the court 
must acquit the defendant because according to the Argentine statute of limitations he had 
ceased to be liable to criminal proceedings against him on May   a very short time before 
the abduction he now argued in the same vein that no death penalty could be pronounced 

because capital punishment had been abolished unconditionally in Germany 
Then came Eichmanns last statement His hopes for justice were disappointed the court had not 
believed him though he had always done his best to tell the truth The court did not understand 
him he had never been a Jewhater and he had never willed the murder of human beings His 
guilt came from his obedience and obedience is praised as a virtue His virtue had been abused 
by the Nazi leaders But he was not one of the ruling clique he was a victim and only the leaders 
deserved punishment He did not go quite as far as many of the other lowranking war criminals 
who complained bitterly that they had been told never to worry about responsibilities and that 
they were now unable to call those responsible to account because these had escaped and 
deserted them  by committing suicide or by having been hanged I am not the monster I am 
made out to be Eichmann said I am the victim of a fallacy He did not use the word 
scapegoat but he confirmed what Servatius had said it was his profound conviction that he 
must suffer for the acts of others After two more days on Friday December   at nine 
oclock in the morning the death sentence was pronounced 
 
Three months later on March   review proceedings were opened before the Court of 
Appeal Israels Supreme Court before five judges presided over by Itzhak Olshan Mr Hausner 
appeared again with four assistants for the prosecution and Dr Servatius with none for the 
defense Counsel for the defense repeated all the old arguments against the competence of the 
Israeli court and since all his efforts to persuade the West German government to start 
extradition proceedings had been in vain he now demanded that Israel offer extradition He had 
brought with him a new list of witnesses but there was not a single one among them who could 
conceivably have produced anything resembling new evidence He had included in the list Dr 
Hans Globke whom Eichmann had never seen in his life and of whom he had probably heard for 
the first time in Jerusalem and even more startling Dr Chaim Weizmann who had been dead 
for ten years The plaidoyer was an incredible hodgepodge full of errors in one instance the 
defense offered as new evidence the French translation of a document that had already been 
submitted by the prosecution in two other cases it had simply misread the documents and so 
on its carelessness contrasted vividly with the rather careful introduction of certain remarks that 
were bound to be offensive to the court gassing was again a medical matter a Jewish court 
had no right to sit in judgment over the fate of the children from Lidice since they were not 
Jewish Israeli legal procedure ran counter to Continental procedure  to which Eichmann 
because of his national origin was entitled  in that it required the defendant to provide the 
evidence for his defense and this the accused had been unable to do because neither witnesses 
nor defense documents were available in Israel In short the trial had been unfair the judgment 
unjust 
The proceedings before the Court of Appeal lasted only a week after which the court adjourned 
for two months On May   the second judgment was read  somewhat less voluminous 
than the first but still fiftyone singlespaced legalsized pages It ostensibly confirmed the District 
Court on all points and to make this confirmation the judges would not have needed two months 
and fiftyone pages The judgment of the Court of Appeal was actually a revision of the judgment 
of the lower court although it did not say so In conspicuous contrast to the original judgment it 
was now found that the appellant had received no superior orders at all He was his own 
superior and he gave all orders in matters that concerned Jewish affairs he had moreover 
eclipsed in importance all his superiors including Mller And in reply to the obvious argument 
of the defense that the Jews would have been no better off had Eichmann never existed the 
judges now stated that the idea of the Final Solution would never have assumed the infernal 
forms of the flayed skin and tortured flesh of millions of Jews without the fanatical zeal and the 
unquenchable blood thirst of the appellant and his accomplices Israels Supreme Court had not 
only accepted the arguments of the prosecution it had adopted its very language 
The same day May  Itzhak BenZvi President of Israel received Eichmanns plea for mercy 
four handwritten pages made upon instructions of my counsel together with letters from his 
wife and his family in Linz The President also received hundreds of letters and telegrams from all 
over the world pleading for clemency outstanding among the senders were the Central 
Conference of American Rabbis the representative body of Reform Judaism in this country and 
a group of professors from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem headed by Martin Buber who 

had been opposed to the trial from the start and who now tried to persuade BenGurion to 
intervene for clemency Mr BenZvi rejected all pleas for mercy on May  two days after the 
Supreme Court had delivered its judgment and a few hours later on that same day  it was a 
Thursday  shortly before midnight Eichmann was hanged his body was cremated and the 
ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean outside Israeli waters 
The speed with which the death sentence was carried out was extraordinary even if one takes 
into account that Thursday night was the last possible occasion before the following Monday 
since Friday Saturday and Sunday are all religious holidays for one or another of the three 
denominations in the country The execution took place less than two hours after Eichmann was 
informed of the rejection of his plea for mercy there had not even been time for a last meal The 
explanation may well be found in two lastminute attempts Dr Servatius made to save his client  
an application to a court in West Germany to force the government to demand Eichmanns 
extradition even now and a threat to invoke Article  of the Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Neither Dr Servatius nor his assistant was in Israel 
when Eichmanns plea was rejected and the Israeli government probably wanted to close the 
case which had been going on for two years before the defense could even apply for a stay in 
the date of execution 
The death sentence had been expected and there was hardly anyone to quarrel with it but 
things were altogether different when it was learned that the Israelis had carried it out The 
protests were shortlived but they were widespread and they were voiced by people of influence 
and prestige The most common argument was that Eichmanns deeds defied the possibility of 
human punishment that it was pointless to impose the death sentence for crimes of such 
magnitude  which of course was true in a sense except that it could not conceivably mean that 
he who had murdered millions should for this very reason escape punishment On a considerably 
lower level the death sentence was called unimaginative and very imaginative alternatives 
were proposed forthwith  Eichmann should have spent the rest of his life at hard labor in the arid 
stretches of the Negev helping with his sweat to reclaim the Jewish homeland a punishment he 
would probably not have survived for more than a single day to say nothing of the fact that in 
Israel the desert of the south is hardly looked upon as a penal colony or in Madison Avenue 
style Israel should have reached divine heights rising above the understandable legal 
political and even human considerations by calling together all those who took part in the 
capture trial and sentencing to a public ceremony with Eichmann there in shackles and with 
television cameras and radio to decorate them as the heroes of the century 
Martin Buber called the execution a mistake of historical dimensions as it might serve to 
expiate the guilt felt by many young persons in Germany  an argument that oddly echoed 
Eichmanns own ideas on the matter though Buber hardly knew that he had wanted to hang 
himself in public in order to lift the burden of guilt from the shoulders of German youngsters It is 
strange that Buber a man not only of eminence but of very great intelligence should not see how 
spurious these much publicized guilt feelings necessarily are It is quite gratifying to feel guilty if 
you havent done anything wrong how noble Whereas it is rather hard and certainly depressing 
to admit guilt and to repent The youth of Germany is surrounded on all sides and in all walks of 
life by men in positions of authority and in public office who are very guilty indeed but who feel 
nothing of the sort The normal reaction to this state of affairs should be indignation but 
indignation would be quite risky  not a danger to life and limb but definitely a handicap in a 
career Those young German men and women who every once in a while  on the occasion of all 
the Diary of  Anne Frank hubbub and of the Eichmann trial  treat us to hysterical outbreaks of 
guilt feelings are not staggering under the burden of the past their fathers guilt rather they are 
trying to escape from the pressure of very present and actual problems into a cheap 
sentimentality Professor Buber went on to say that he felt no pity at all for Eichmann because 
he could feel pity only for those whose actions I understand in my heart and he stressed what 
he had said many years ago in Germany  that he had only in a formal sense a common 
humanity with those who took part in the acts of the Third Reich This lofty attitude was of 
course more of a luxury than those who had to try Eichmann could afford since the law 
presupposes precisely that we have a common humanity with those whom we accuse and judge 
and condemn As far as I know Buber was the only philosopher to go on public record on the 
subject of Eichmanns execution shortly before the trial started Karl Jaspers had given a radio 

interview in Basel later published in Der Monat in which he argued the case for an international 
tribunal it was disappointing to find him dodging on the highest possible level the very problem 
Eichmann and his deeds had posed 
Least of all was heard from those who were against the death penalty on principle 
unconditionally their arguments would have remained valid since they would not have needed to 
specify them for this particular case They seem to have felt  rightly I think  that this was not a 
very promising case on which to fight 
Adolf Eichmann went to the gallows with great dignity He had asked for a bottle of red wine and 
had drunk half of it He refused the help of the Protestant minister the Reverend William Hull 
who offered to read the Bible with him he had only two more hours to live and therefore no time 
to waste He walked the fifty yards from his cell to the execution chamber calm and erect with 
his hands bound behind him When the guards tied his ankles and knees he asked them to 
loosen the bonds so that he could stand straight I dont need that he said when the black hood 
was offered him He was in complete command of himself nay he was more he was completely 
himself Nothing could have demonstrated this more convincingly than the grotesque silliness of 
his last words He began by stating emphatically that he was a Gottglubiger to express in 
common Nazi fashion that he was no Christian and did not believe in life after death He then 
proceeded After a short while gentlemen we shall all meet again Such is the fate of all men 
Long live Germany long live Argentina long live Austria I shall not forget them In the face of 
death he had found the clich used in funeral oratory Under the gallows his memory played him 
the last trick he was elated and he forgot that this was his own funeral 
It was as though in those last minutes he was summing up the lesson that this long course in 
human wickedness had taught usthe lesson of the fearsome wordandthoughtdefying banality 
of evil 
 
 
 
Epilogue 
 
 
The irregularities and abnormalities of the trial in Jerusalem were so many so varied and of such 
legal complexity that they overshadowed during the trial as they have in the surprisingly small 
amount of posttrial literature the central moral political and even legal problems that the trial 
inevitably posed Israel herself through the pretrial statements of Prime Minister BenGurion and 
through the way the accusation was framed by the prosecutor confused the issues further by 
listing a great number of purposes the trial was supposed to achieve all of which were ulterior 
purposes with respect to the law and to courtroom procedure The purpose of a trial is to render 
justice and nothing else even the noblest of ulterior purposes  the making of a record of the 
Hitler regime which would withstand the test of history as Robert G Storey executive trial 
counsel at Nuremberg formulated the supposed higher aims of the Nuremberg Trials  can only 
detract from the laws main business to weigh the charges brought against the accused to 
render judgment and to mete out due punishment 
The judgment in the Eichmann case whose first two sections were written in reply to the higher
purpose theory as it was expounded both inside and outside the courtroom could not have been 
clearer in this respect and more to the point All attempts to widen the range of the trial had to be 
resisted because the court could not allow itself to be enticed into provinces which are outside 
its sphere    the judicial process has ways of its own which are laid down by law and which do 
not change whatever the subject of the trial may be The court moreover could not overstep 
these limits without ending in complete failure Not only does it not have at its disposal the tools 
required for the investigation of general questions it speaks with an authority whose very weight 
depends upon its limitation No one has made us judges of matters outside the realm of law 
and no greater weight is to be attached to our opinion on them than to that of any person 
devoting study and thought to them Hence to the question most commonly asked about the 
Eichmann trial What good does it do there is but one possible answer It will do justice 
The objections raised against the Eichmann trial were of three kinds First there were those 
objections that had been raised against the Nuremberg Trials and were now repeated Eichmann 

was tried under a retroactive law and appeared in the court of the victors Second there were 
those objections that applied only to the Jerusalem court in that they questioned either its 
competence as such or its failure to take into account the act of kidnaping And finally and most 
important there were objections to the charge itself that Eichmann had committed crimes 
against the Jewish people instead of against humanity and hence to the law under which he 
was tried and this objection led to the logical conclusion that the only proper court to try these 
crimes was an international tribunal 
The courts reply to the first set of objections was simple the Nuremberg Trials were cited in 
Jerusalem as valid precedent and acting under municipal law the judges could hardly have 
done otherwise since the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators Punishment Law of  was itself 
based on this precedent This particular legislation the judgment pointed out is totally different 
from any other legislation usual in criminal codes and the reason for its difference lies in the 
nature of the crimes it deals with Its retroactivity one may add violates only formally not 
substantially the principle nullum crimen nulla poena sine lege since this applies meaningfully 
only to acts known to the legislator if a crime unknown before such as genocide suddenly 
makes its appearance justice itself demands a judgment according to a new law in the case of 
Nuremberg this new law was the Charter the London Agreement of  in the case of Israel 
it was the Law of  The question is not whether these laws were retroactive which of 
course they had to be but whether they were adequate that is whether they applied only to 
crimes previously unknown This prerequisite for retroactive legislation had been seriously marred 
in the Charter that provided for the establishment of the International Military Tribunal at 
Nuremberg and it may be for this reason that the discussion of these matters has remained 
somewhat confused 
The Charter accorded jurisdiction over three sorts of crimes crimes against peace which the 
Tribunal called the supreme international crime    in that it contains within itself the 
accumulated evil of the whole war crimes and crimes against humanity Of these only the 
last the crime against humanity was new and unprecedented Aggressive warfare is at least as 
old as recorded history and while it had been denounced as criminal many times before it had 
never been recognized as such in any formal sense None of the current justifications of the 
Nuremberg courts jurisdiction over this matter has much to commend it It is true that Wilhelm II 
had been cited before a tribunal of the Allied powers after the First World War but the crime the 
former German Kaiser had been charged with was not war but breach of treaties  and 
specifically the violation of Belgiums neutrality It is also true that the BriandKellogg pact of 
August  had ruled out war as an instrument of national policy but the pact contained 
neither a criterion of aggression nor a mention of sanctions  quite apart from the fact that the 
security system that the pact was meant to bring about had collapsed prior to the outbreak of 
war Moreover one of the judging countries namely Soviet Russia was open to the tuquoque 
argument Hadnt the Russians attacked Finland and divided Poland in  with complete 
impunity War crimes on the other hand surely no more unprecedented than the crimes 
against peace were covered by international law The Hague and Geneva Conventions had 
defined these violations of the laws or customs of war they consisted chiefly of illtreatment of 
prisoners and of warlike acts against civilian populations No new law with retroactive force was 
needed here and the main difficulty at Nuremberg lay in the indisputable fact that here again the 
tuquoque argument 
applied Russia which had never signed the Hague Convention Italy incidentally had not 
ratified it either was more than suspected of mistreatment of prisoners and according to recent 
investigations the Russians also seem to be responsible for the murder of fifteen thousand Polish 
officers whose bodies were found at Katyn Forest in the neighborhood of Smolensk in Russia 
Worse the saturation bombing of open cities and above all the dropping of atomic bombs on 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki clearly constituted war crimes in the sense of the Hague Convention 
And while the bombing of German cities had been provoked by the enemy by the bombing of 
London and Coventry and Rotterdam the same cannot be said of the use of an entirely new and 
overwhelmingly powerful weapon whose existence could have been announced and 
demonstrated in many other ways To be sure the most obvious reason that the violations of the 
Hague Convention committed by the Allies were never even discussed in legal terms was that the 
International Military Tribunals were international in name only that they were in fact the courts of 

the victors and the authority of their judgment doubtful in any case was not enhanced when the 
coalition that had won the war and then undertaken this joint enterprise broke up to quote Otto 
Kirchheimer before the ink on the Nuremberg judgments had time to dry But this most obvious 
reason is neither the only nor perhaps the most potent reason that no Allied war crimes in the 
sense of the Hague Convention were cited and prosecuted and it is only fair to add that the 
Nuremberg Tribunal was at least very cautious about convicting the German defendants on 
charges that were open to the tuquoque argument For the truth of the matter was that by the 
end of the Second World War everybody knew that technical developments in the instruments of 
violence had made the adoption of criminal warfare inevitable It was precisely the distinction 
between soldier and civilian between army and home population between military targets and 
open cities upon which the Hague Conventions definitions of war crimes rested that had 
become obsolete Hence it was felt that under these new conditions war crimes were only those 
outside all military necessities where a deliberate inhuman purpose could be demonstrated 
This factor of gratuitous brutality was a valid criterion for determining what under the 
circumstances constituted a war crime It was not valid for but was unfortunately introduced into 
the fumbling definitions of the only entirely new crime the crime against humanity which the 
Charter in Article c defined as an inhuman act  as though this crime too were a matter of 
criminal excess in the pursuit of war and victory However it was by no means this sort of well
known offense that had prompted the Allies to declare in the words of Churchill that punishment 
of war criminals was one of the principal war aims but on the contrary reports of unheardof 
atrocities the blotting out of whole peoples the clearance of whole regions of their native 
population that is not only crimes that no conception of military necessity could sustain but 
crimes that were in fact independent of the war and that announced a policy of systematic murder 
to be continued in time of peace This crime was indeed not covered by international or municipal 
law and moreover it was the only crime to which the tuquoque argument did not apply And yet 
there was no other crime in the face of which the Nuremberg judges felt so uncomfortable and 
which they left in a more tantalizing state of ambiguity It is perfectly true that  in the words of the 
French judge at Nuremberg Donnedieu de Vabres to whom we owe one of the best analyses of 
the trial Le Procs de Nuremberg   the category of crimes against humanity which the 
Charter had let enter by a very small door evaporated by virtue of the Tribunals judgment The 
judges however were as little consistent as the Charter itself for although they preferred to 
convict as Kirchheimer says on the war crime charge which embraced all the traditional 
common crimes while underemphasizing as much as possible the charges of crimes against 
humanity when it came to pronouncing sentence they revealed their true sentiment by meting 
out their most severe punishment the death penalty only to those who had been found guilty of 
those quite uncommon atrocities that actually constituted a crime against humanity or as the 
French prosecutor Franois de Menthon called it with greater accuracy a crime against the 
human status The notion that aggression is the supreme international crime was silently 
abandoned when a number of men were sentenced to death who had never been convicted of a 
conspiracy against peace 
In justification of the Eichmann trial it has frequently been maintained that although the greatest 
crime committed during the last war had been against the Jews the Jews had been only 
bystanders in Nuremberg and the judgment of the Jerusalem court made the point that now for 
the first time the Jewish catastrophe occupied the central place in the court proceedings and 
that it was this fact which distinguished this trial from those which preceded it at Nuremberg 
and elsewhere But this is at best a halftruth It was precisely the Jewish catastrophe that 
prompted the Allies to conceive of a crime against humanity in the first place because Julius 
Stone has written in Legal Controls of International Conflict  the mass murder of the 
Jews if they were Germanys own nationals could only be reached by the humanity count And 
what had prevented the Nuremberg Tribunal from doing full justice to this crime was not that its 
victims were Jews but that the Charter demanded that this crime which had so little to do with 
war that its commission actually conflicted with and hindered the wars conduct was to be tied up 
with the other crimes How deeply the Nuremberg judges were aware of the outrage perpetrated 
against the Jews may perhaps best be gauged by the fact that the only defendant to be 
condemned to death on a crimeagainsthumanity charge alone was Julius Streicher whose 
specialty had been antiSemitic obscenities In this instance the judges disregarded all other 

considerations 
What distinguished the trial in Jerusalem from those that preceded it was not that the Jewish 
people now occupied the central place In this respect on the contrary the trial resembled the 
postwar trials in Poland and Hungary in Yugoslavia and Greece in Soviet Russia and France in 
short in all formerly Nazioccupied countries The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg 
had been established for war criminals whose crimes could not be localized all others were 
delivered to the countries where they had committed their crimes Only the major war criminals 
had acted without territorial limitations and Eichmann certainly was not one of them This  and 
not as was frequently maintained his disappearance  was the reason he was not accused at 
Nuremberg Martin Bormann for instance was accused tried and condemned to death in 
absentia If Eichmanns activities had spread all over occupied Europe this was so not because 
he was so important that territorial limits did not apply to him but because it was in the nature of 
his task the collection and deportation of all Jews that he and his men had to roam the continent 
It was the territorial dispersion of the Jews that made the crime against them an international 
concern in the limited legal sense of the Nuremberg Charter Once the Jews had a territory of 
their own the State in Israel they obviously had as much right to sit in judgment on the crimes 
committed against their people as the Poles had to judge crimes committed in Poland All 
objections raised against the Jerusalem trial on the ground of the principle of territorial jurisdiction 
were legalistic in the extreme and although the court spent a number of sessions discussing all 
these objections they were actually of no great relevance There was not the slightest doubt that 
Jews had been killed qua Jews irrespective of their nationalities at the time and though it is true 
that the Nazis killed many Jews who had chosen to deny their ethnic origin and would perhaps 
have preferred to be killed as Frenchmen or as Germans justice could be done even in these 
cases only if one took the intent and the purpose of the criminals into account 
Equally unfounded I think was the even more frequent argument against the possible partiality of 
Jewish judges  that they especially if they were citizens of a Jewish State were judging in their 
own cause It is difficult to see how the Jewish judges differed in this respect from their 
colleagues in any of the other Successor trials where Polish judges pronounced sentence for 
crimes against the Polish people or Czech judges sat in judgment on what had happened in 
Prague and in Bratislava Mr Hausner in the last of his articles in the Saturday Evening Post 
unwittingly added new fuel to this argument he said that the prosecution realized at once that 
Eichmann could not be defended by an Israeli lawyer because there would be a conflict between 
professional duties and national emotions Well this conflict constituted the gist of all the 
objections to Jewish judges and Mr Hausners argument in their favor that a judge may hate the 
crime and yet be fair to the criminal applies to the defense counsel as well the lawyer who 
defends a murderer sures outside the courtroom made it inadvisable to put it mildly to charge an 
Israeli citizen with the defense of Eichmann  Finally the argument that no Jewish State had 
existed at the time when the crime was committed is surely so formalistic so out of tune with 
reality and with all demands that justice must be done that we may safely leave it to the learned 
debates of the experts In the interest of justice as distinguished from the concern with certain 
procedures which important in its own right can never be permitted to overrule justice the laws 
chief concern the court to justify its competence would have needed to invoke neither the 
principle of passive personality  that the victims were Jews and that only Israel was entitled to 
speak in their names  nor the principle of universal jurisdiction applying to Eichmann because he 
was hostis generis humani the rules that are applicable to piracy Both theories discussed at 
length inside and outside the Jerusalem courtroom actually blurred the issues and obscured the 
obvious similarity between the Jerusalem trial and the trials that had preceded it in other countries 
where special legislation had likewise been enacted to ensure the punishment of the Nazis or 
their collaborators 
The passivepersonality principle which in Jerusalem was based upon the learned opinion of P 
N Drost in Crime of State  that under certain circumstances the forum patriae victimae 
may be competent to try the case unfortunately implies that criminal proceedings are initiated by 
the government in the name of the victims who are assumed to have a right to revenge This was 
indeed the position of the prosecution and Mr Hausner opened his address with the following 
words When I stand before you judges of Israel in this court to accuse Adolf Eichmann I do 
not stand alone Here with me at this moment stand six million prosecutors But alas they cannot 

rise to level the finger of accusation in the direction of the glass dock and cry out Jaccuse against 
the man who sits there    Their blood cries to Heaven but their voice cannot be heard Thus it 
falls to me to be their mouthpiece and to deliver the heinous accusation in their name With such 
rhetoric the prosecution gave substance to the chief argument against the trial that it was 
established not in order to satisfy the demands of justice but to still the victims desire for and 
perhaps right to vengeance Criminal proceedings since they are mandatory and thus initiated 
even if the victim would prefer to forgive and forget rest on laws whose essence  to quote 
Telford Taylor writing in the New York Times Magazine  is that a crime is not committed only 
against the victim but primarily against the community whose law is violated The wrongdoer is 
brought to justice because his act has disturbed and gravely endangered the community as a 
whole and not because as in civil suits damage has been done to individuals who are entitled to 
reparation The reparation effected in criminal cases is of an altogether different nature it is the 
body politic itself that stands in need of being repaired and it is the general public order that has 
been thrown out of gear and must be restored as it were It is in other words the law not the 
plaintiff that must prevail 
Even less justifiable than the prosecutions effort to rest its case on the passivepersonality 
principle was the inclination of the court to claim competence in the name of universal jurisdiction 
for it was in flagrant conflict with the conduct of the trial as well as with the law under which 
Eichmann was tried The principle of universal jurisdiction it was said was applicable because 
crimes against humanity are similar to the old crime of piracy and who commits them has 
become like the pirate in traditional international law hostis humani generis Eichmann however 
was accused chiefly of crimes against the Jewish people and his capture which the theory of 
universal jurisdiction was meant to excuse was certainly not due to his also having committed 
crimes against humanity but exclusively to his role in the Final Solution of the Jewish problem 
Yet even if Israel had kidnaped Eichmann solely because he was hostis humani generis and not 
because he was hostis Judaeorum it would have been difficult to justify the legality of his arrest 
The pirates exception to the territorial principle  which in the absence of an international penal 
code remains the only valid legal principle  is made not because he is the enemy of all and 
hence can be judged by all but because his crime is committed on the high seas and the high 
seas are no mans land The pirate moreover in defiance of all law acknowledging obedience 
to no flag whatsoever H Zeisel Britannica Book of the Year  is by definition in business 
entirely for himself he is an outlaw because he has chosen to put himself outside all organized 
communities and it is for this reason that he has become the enemy of all alike Surely no one 
will maintain that Eichmann was in business for himself or that he acknowledged obedience to no 
flag whatsoever In this respect the piracy theory served only to dodge one of the fundamental 
problems posed by crimes of this kind namely that they were and could only be committed 
under a criminal law and by a criminal state 
The analogy between genocide and piracy is not new and it is therefore of some importance to 
note that the Genocide Convention whose resolutions were adopted by the United Nations 
General Assembly on December   expressly rejected the claim to universal jurisdiction 
and provided instead that persons charged with genocide    shall be tried by a competent 
tribunal of the States in the territory of which the act was committed or by such international penal 
tribunal as may have jurisdiction In accordance with this Convention of which Israel was a 
signatory the court should have either sought to establish an international tribunal or tried to 
reformulate the territorial principle in such a way that it applied to Israel Both alternatives lay 
definitely within the realm of possibility and within the courts competence The possibility of 
establishing an international tribunal was cursorily dismissed by the court for reasons which we 
shall discuss later but the reason no meaningful redefinition of the territorial principle was sought 
 so that the court finally claimed jurisdiction on the ground of all three principles territorial as well 
as passivepersonality and universaljurisdiction as though merely adding together three entirely 
different legal principles would result in a valid claim  was certainly closely connected with the 
extreme reluctance of all concerned to break fresh ground and act without precedents Israel 
could easily have claimed territorial jurisdiction if she had only explained that territory as the 
law understands it is a political and a legal concept and not merely a geographical term It 
relates not so much and not primarily to a piece of land as to the space between individuals in a 
group whose members are bound to and at the same time separated and protected from each 

other by all kinds of relationships based on a common language religion a common history 
customs and laws Such relationships become spatially manifest insofar as they themselves 
constitute the space wherein the different members of a group relate to and have intercourse with 
each other No State of Israel would ever have come into being if the Jewish people had not 
created and maintained its own specific inbetween space throughout the long centuries of 
dispersion that is prior to the seizure of its old territory The court however never rose to the 
challenge of the unprecedented not even in regard to the unprecedented nature of the origins of 
the Israel state which certainly was closest to its heart and thought Instead it buried the 
proceedings under a flood of precedents  during the sessions of the first week of the trial to 
which the first fiftythree sections of the judgment correspond  many of which sounded at least 
to the laymans ear like elaborate sophisms 
The Eichmann trial then was in actual fact no more but also no less than the last of the 
numerous Successor trials which followed the Nuremberg Trials And the indictment quite 
properly carried in an appendix the official interpretation of the Law of  by Pinhas Rosen 
then Minister of Justice which could not be clearer and less equivocal While other peoples 
passed suitable legislation for the punishment of the Nazis and their collaborators soon after the 
end of the war and some even before it was over the Jewish people    had no political authority 
to bring the Nazi criminals and their collaborators to justice until the establishment of the State 
Hence the Eichmann trial differed from the Successor trials only in one respect  the defendant 
had not been duly arrested and extradited to Israel on the contrary a clear violation of 
international law had been committed in order to bring him to justice We mentioned before that 
only Eichmanns de facto statelessness enabled Israel to get away with kidnaping him and it is 
understandable that despite the innumerable precedents cited in Jerusalem to justify the act of 
kidnaping the only relevant one the capture of Berthold Jakob a Leftist German Jewish 
journalist in Switzerland by Gestapo agents in  was never mentioned None of the other 
precedents applied because they invariably concerned a fugitive from justice who was brought 
back not only to the place of his crimes but to a court that had issued or could have issued a 
valid warrant of arrestconditions that Israel could not have fulfilled In this instance Israel had 
indeed violated the territorial principle whose great significance lies in the fact that the earth is 
inhabited by many peoples and that these peoples are ruled by many different laws so that every 
extension of one territorys law beyond the borders and limitations of its validity will bring it into 
immediate conflict with the law of another territory 
This unhappily was the only almost unprecedented feature in the whole Eichmann trial and 
certainly it was the least entitled ever to become a valid precedent What are we going to say if 
tomorrow it occurs to some African state to send its agents into Mississippi and to kidnap one of 
the leaders of the segregationist movement there And what are we going to reply if a court in 
Ghana or the Congo quotes the Eichmann case as a precedent Its justification was the 
unprecedentedness of the crime and the coming into existence of a Jewish State There were 
moreover important mitigating circumstances in that there hardly existed a true alternative if one 
indeed wished to bring Eichmann to justice Argentina had an impressive record for not 
extraditing Nazi criminals even if there had been an extradition treaty between Israel and 
Argentina an extradition request would almost certainly not have been honored Nor would it 
have helped to hand Eichmann over to the Argentine police for extradition to West Germany for 
the Bonn government had earlier sought extradition from Argentina of such wellknown Nazi 
criminals as Karl Klingenfuss and Dr Josef Mengele the latter implicated in the most horrifying 
medical experiments at Auschwitz and in charge of the selection without any success In the 
case of Eichmann such a request would have been doubly hopeless since according to 
Argentine law all offenses connected with the last war had fallen under the statute of limitation 
fifteen years after the end of the war so that after May   Eichmann could not have been 
legally extradited anyway In short the realm of legality offered no alternative to kidnaping 
Those who are convinced that justice and nothing else is the end of law will be inclined to 
condone the kidnaping act though not because of precedents but on the contrary as a 
desperate unprecedented and noprecedentsetting act necessitated by the unsatisfactory 
condition of international law In this perspective there existed but one real alternative to what 
Israel had done instead of capturing Eichmann and flying him to Israel the Israeli agents could 
have killed him right then and there in the streets of Buenos Aires This course of action was 

frequently mentioned in the debates on the case and somewhat oddly was recommended most 
fervently by those who were most shocked by the kidnaping The notion was not without merit 
because the facts of the case were beyond dispute but those who proposed it forgot that he who 
takes the law into his own hands will render a service to justice only if he is willing to transform 
the situation in such a way that the law can again operate and his act can at least posthumously 
be validated Two precedents in the recent past come immediately to mind There was the case 
of Shalom Schwartzbard who in Paris on May   shot and killed Simon Petlyura former 
hetman of the Ukrainian armies and responsible for the pogroms during the Russian civil war that 
claimed about a hundred thousand victims between  and  And there was the case of 
the Armenian Tehlirian who in  in the middle of Berlin shot to death Talaat Bey the great 
killer in the Armenian pogroms of  in which it is estimated that a third six hundred thousand 
of the Armenian population in Turkey was massacred The point is that neither of these assassins 
was satisfied with killing his criminal but that both immediately gave themselves up to the police 
and insisted on being tried Each used his trial to show the world through court procedure what 
crimes against his people had been committed and gone unpunished In the Schwartzbard trial 
especially methods very similar to those in the Eichmann trial were used There was the same 
stress on extensive documentation of the crimes but that time it was prepared for the defense by 
the Comit des Dlgations Juives under the chairmanship of the late Dr Leo Motzkin which 
needed a year and a half to collect the material and then published it in Les Pogromes en Ukraine 
sous les gouvernements ukrainiens   just as that time it was the accused and 
his lawyer who spoke in the name of the victims and who incidentally even then raised the point 
about the Jews who had never defended themselves See the plaidoyer of Henri Torrs in his 
book Le Procs des Pogromes  
Both men were acquitted and in both cases it was felt that their gesture signified that their race 
had finally decided to defend itself to leave behind its moral abdication to overcome its 
resignation in the face of insults as Georges Suarez admiringly put it in the case of Shalom 
Schwartzbard 
The advantages of this solution to the problem of legalities that stand in the way of justice are 
obvious The trial it is true is again a show trial and even a show but its hero the one in the 
center of the play on whom all eyes are fastened is now the true hero while at the same time 
the trial character of the proceedings is safeguarded because it is not a spectacle with 
prearranged results but contains that element of irreducible risk which according to 
Kirchheimer is an indispensable factor in all criminal trials Also the Jaccuse so indispensable 
from the viewpoint of the victim sounds of course much more convincing in the mouth of a man 
who has been forced to take the law into his own hands than in the voice of a government
appointed agent who risks nothing And yet  quite apart from practical considerations such as 
that Buenos Aires in the sixties hardly offers either the same guarantees or the same publicity for 
the defendant that Paris and Berlin offered in the twenties  it is more than doubtful that this 
solution would have been justifiable in Eichmanns case and it is obvious that it would have been 
altogether unjustifiable if carried out by government agents The point in favor of Schwartzbard 
and Tehlirian was that each was a member of an ethnic group that did not possess its own state 
and legal system that there was no tribunal in the world to which either group could have brought 
its victims Schwartzbard who died in  more than ten years before the proclamation of the 
Jewish State was not a Zionist and not a nationalist of any sort but there is no doubt that he 
would have welcomed the State of Israel enthusiastically for no other reason than that it would 
have provided a tribunal for crimes that had so often gone unpunished His sense of justice would 
have been satisfied And when we read the letter he addressed from his prison in Paris to his 
brothers and sisters in Odessa  Failes savoir daps les villes et dans les villages de Balta 
Proskouro Tzcherkass Ouman Jitomir     portezy le message difiant la colre juive a tir sa 
vengeance Le sang de lassassin Petlioura qui a jailli daps la ville mondiale a Paris    
rappellera le crime froce    commis envers le pauvre et abandonn people juif   we recognize 
immediately not perhaps the language that Mr Hausner actually spoke during the trial Shalom 
Schwartzbards language was infinitely more dignified and more moving but certainly the 
sentiments and the state of mind of Jews all over the world to which it was bound to appeal 
 
I have insisted on the similarities between the Schwartzbard trial in  in Paris and the 

Eichmann trial in  in Jerusalem because they demonstrate how little Israel like the Jewish 
people in general was prepared to recognize in the crimes that Eichmann was accused of an 
unprecedented crime and precisely how difficult such a recognition must have been for the 
Jewish people In the eyes of the Jews thinking exclusively in terms of their own history the 
catastrophe that had befallen them under Hitler in which a third of the people perished appeared 
not as the most recent of crimes the unprecedented crime of genocide but on the contrary as 
the oldest crime they knew and remembered This misunderstanding almost inevitable if we 
consider not only the facts of Jewish history but also and more important the current Jewish 
historical selfunderstanding is actually at the root of all the failures and shortcomings of the 
Jerusalem trial None of the participants ever arrived at a clear understanding of the actual horror 
of Auschwitz which is of a different nature from all the atrocities of the past because it appeared 
to prosecution and judges alike as not much more than the most horrible pogrom in Jewish 
history They therefore believed that a direct line existed from the early antiSemitism of the Nazi 
Party to the Nuremberg Laws and from there to the expulsion of Jews from the Reich and finally 
to the gas chambers Politically and legally however these were crimes different not only in 
degree of seriousness but in essence 
 
The Nuremberg Laws of  legalized the discrimination practiced before that by the German 
majority against the Jewish minority According to international law it was the privilege of the 
sovereign German nation to declare to be a national minority whatever part of its population it 
saw fit as long as its minority laws conformed to the rights and guarantees established by 
internationally recognized minority treaties and agreements International Jewish organizations 
therefore promptly tried to obtain for this newest minority the same rights and guarantees that 
minorities in Eastern and Southeastern Europe had been granted at Geneva But even though 
this protection was not granted the Nuremberg Laws were generally recognized by other nations 
as part of German law so that it was impossible for a German national to enter into a mixed 
marriage in Holland for instance The crime of the Nuremberg Laws was a national crime it 
violated national constitutional rights and liberties but it was of no concern to the comity of 
nations Enforced emigration however or expulsion which became official policy after  
did concern the international community for the simple reason that those who were expelled 
appeared at the frontiers of other countries which were forced either to accept the uninvited 
guests or to smuggle them into another country equally unwilling to accept them Expulsion of 
nationals in other words is already an offense against humanity if by humanity we understand 
no more than the comity of nations Neither the national crime of legalized discrimination which 
amounted to persecution by law nor the international crime of expulsion was unprecedented 
even in the modern age Legalized discrimination had been practiced by all Balkan countries and 
expulsion on a mass scale had occurred after many revolutions It was when the Nazi regime 
declared that the German people not only were unwilling to have any Jews in Germany but 
wished to make the entire Jewish people disappear from the face of the earth that the new crime 
the crime against humanity  in the sense of a crime against the human status or against the 
very nature of mankind  appeared Expulsion and genocide though both are international 
offenses must remain distinct the former is an offense against fellownations whereas the latter 
is an attack upon human diversity as such that is upon a characteristic of the human status 
without which the very words mankind or humanity would be devoid of meaning 
Had the court in Jerusalem understood that there were distinctions between discrimination 
expulsion and genocide it would immediately have become clear that the supreme crime it was 
confronted with the physical extermination of the Jewish people was a crime against humanity 
perpetrated upon the body of the Jewish people and that only the choice of victims not the 
nature of the crime could be derived from the long history of Jewhatred and antiSemitism 
Insofar as the victims were Jews it was right and proper that a Jewish court should sit in 
judgment but insofar as the crime was a crime against humanity it needed an international 
tribunal to do justice to it The failure of the court to draw this distinction was surprising because 
it had actually been made before by the former Israeli Minister of Justice Mr Rosen who in  
had insisted on a distinction between this bill for crimes against the Jewish people and the Law 
for the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide which was discussed but not passed by the 
Israeli Parliament Obviously the court felt it had no right to overstep the limits of municipal law 

so that genocide not being covered by an Israeli law could not properly enter into its 
considerations Among the numerous and highly qualified voices that raised objections to the 
court in Jerusalem and were in favor of an international tribunal only one that of Karl Jaspers 
stated clearly and unequivocally  in a radio interview held before the trial began and later 
published in Der Monat  that the crime against the Jews was also a crime against mankind and 
that consequently the verdict can be handed down only by a court of justice representing all 
mankind Jaspers proposed that the court in Jerusalem after hearing the factual evidence 
waive the right to pass sentence declaring itself incompetent to do so because the legal 
nature of the crime in question was still open to dispute as was the subsequent question of who 
would be competent to pass sentence on a crime which had been committed on government 
orders Jaspers stated further that one thing alone was certain This crime is both more and less 
than common murder and though it was not a war crime either there was no doubt that 
mankind would certainly be destroyed if states were permitted to perpetrate such crimes 
Jaspers proposal which no one in Israel even bothered to discuss would in this form 
presumably have been impracticable from a purely technical point of view The question of a 
courts jurisdiction must be decided before the trial begins and once a court has been declared 
competent it must also pass judgment However these purely formalistic objections could easily 
have been met if Jaspers had called not upon the court but rather upon the state of Israel to 
waive its right to carry out the sentence once it had been handed down in view of the 
unprecedented nature of the courts findings Israel might then have had recourse to the United 
Nations and demonstrated with all the evidence at hand that the need for an international 
criminal court was imperative in view of these new crimes committed against mankind as a 
whole It would then have been in Israels power to make trouble to create a wholesome 
disturbance by asking again and again just what it should do with this man whom it was holding 
prisoner constant repetition would have impressed on worldwide public opinion the need for a 
permanent international criminal court Only by creating in this way an embarrassing situation 
of concern to the representatives of all nations would it be possible to prevent mankind from 
setting its mind at ease and massacre of the Jews    from becoming a model for crimes to 
come perhaps the smallscale and quite paltry example of future genocide The very 
monstrousness of the events is minimized before a tribunal that represents one nation only 
 
This argument in favor of an international tribunal was unfortunately confused with other 
proposals based on different and considerably less weighty considerations Many friends of 
Israel both Jews and nonJews feared that the trial would harm Israels prestige and give rise to 
a reaction against Jews the world over It was thought that Jews did not have the right to appear 
as judges in their own case but could act only as accusers Israel should therefore hold 
Eichmann prisoner until a special tribunal could be created by the United Nations to judge him 
Quite apart from the fact that Israel in the proceedings against Eichmann was doing no more 
than what all the countries which had been occupied by Germany had long since done and that 
justice was at stake here not the prestige of Israel or of the Jewish people all these proposals 
had one flaw in common they could too easily be countered by Israel They were indeed quite 
unrealistic in view of the fact that the UN General Assembly had twice rejected proposals to 
consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court ADL Bulletin But 
another more practical proposition which usually is not mentioned precisely because it was 
feasible was made by Dr Nahum Goldmann president of the World Jewish Congress 
Goldmann called upon BenGurion to set up an international court in Jerusalem with judges from 
each of the countries that had suffered under Nazi occupation This would not have been enough 
it would have been only an enlargement of the Successor trials and the chief impairment of 
justice that it was being rendered in the court of the victors would not have been cured But it 
would have been a practical step in the right direction 
Israel as may be remembered reacted against all these proposals with great violence And while 
it is true as has been pointed out by Yosal Rogat in The Eichmann Trial and the Rule of Law 
published by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions Santa Barbara California  
that BenGurion always seemed to misunderstand completely when asked Why should he not 
be tried before an international court  it is also true that those who asked the question did not 
understand that for Israel the only unprecedented feature of the trial was that for the first time 

since the year  when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans Jews were able to sit in 
judgment on crimes committed against their own people that for the first time they did not need 
to appeal to others for protection and justice or fall back upon the compromised phraseology of 
the rights of man  rights which as no one knew better than they were claimed only by people 
who were too weak to defend their rights of Englishmen and to enforce their own laws The 
very fact that Israel had her own law under which such a trial could be held had been called long 
before the Eichmann trial an expression of a revolutionary transformation that has taken place in 
the political position of the Jewish people  by Mr Rosen on the occasion of the First Reading of 
the Law of  in the Knesset It was against the background of these very vivid experiences 
and aspirations that BenGurion said Israel does not need the protection of an International 
Court 
Moreover the argument that the crime against the Jewish people was first of all a crime against 
mankind upon which the valid proposals for an international tribunal rested stood in flagrant 
contradiction to the law under which Eichmann was tried Hence those who proposed that Israel 
give up her prisoner should have gone one step further and declared The Nazis and Nazi 
Collaborators Punishment Law of  is wrong it is in contradiction to what actually happened 
it does not cover the facts And this would indeed have been quite true For just as a murderer is 
prosecuted because he has violated the law of the community and not because he has deprived 
the Smith family of its husband father and breadwinner so these modern state  employed 
mass murderers must be prosecuted because they violated the order of mankind and not 
because they killed millions of people Nothing is more pernicious to an understanding of these 
new crimes or stands more in the way of the emergence of an international penal code that could 
take care of them than the common illusion that the crime of murder and the crime of genocide 
are essentially the same and that the latter therefore is no new crime properly speaking The 
point of the latter is that an altogether different order is broken and an altogether different 
community is violated And indeed it was because BenGurion knew quite well that the whole 
discussion actually concerned the validity of the Israeli law that he finally reacted nastily and not 
just with violence against the critics of Israeli procedures Whatever these socalled experts 
had to say their arguments were sophisms inspired either by antiSemitism or in the case of 
Jews by inferiority complexes Let the world understand We shall not give up our prisoner 
It is only fair to say that this was by no means the tone in which the trial was conducted in 
Jerusalem But I think it is safe to predict that this last of the Successor trials will no more and 
perhaps even less than its predecessors serve as a valid precedent for future trials of such 
crimes This might be of little import in view of the fact that its main purpose  to prosecute and to 
defend to judge and to punish Adolf Eichmann  was achieved if it were not for the rather 
uncomfortable but hardly deniable possibility that similar crimes may be committed in the future 
The reasons for this sinister potentiality are general as well as particular It is in the very nature of 
things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the 
history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing 
of the past No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the 
commission of crimes On the contrary whatever the punishment once a specific crime has 
appeared for the first time its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever 
have been The particular reasons that speak for the possibility of a repetition of the crimes 
committed by the Nazis are even more plausible The frightening coincidence of the modern 
population explosion with the discovery of technical devices that through automation will make 
large sections of the population superfluous even in terms of labor and that through nuclear 
energy make it possible to deal with this twofold threat by the use of instruments beside which 
Hitlers gassing installations look like an evil childs fumbling toys should be enough to make us 
tremble 
It is essentially for this reason that the unprecedented once it has appeared may become a 
precedent for the future that all trials touching upon crimes against humanity must be judged 
according to a standard that is today still an ideal If genocide is an actual possibility of the 
future then no people on earth  least of all of course the Jewish people in Israel or elsewhere  
can feel reasonably sure of its continued existence without the help and the protection of 
international law Success or failure in dealing with the hitherto unprecedented can lie only in the 
extent to which this dealing may serve as a valid precedent on the road international penal law 

And this demand addressed to the judges in such trials does not overshoot the mark and ask for 
more than can reasonably be expected International law Justice Jackson pointed out at 
Nuremberg is an outgrowth of treaties and agreements between nations and of accepted 
customs Yet every custom has its origin in some single act Our own day has the right to 
institute customs and to conclude agreements that will themselves become sources of a newer 
and strengthened international law What Justice Jackson failed to point out is that in 
consequence of this yet unfinished nature of international law it has become the task of ordinary 
trial judges to render justice without the help of or beyond the limitation set upon them through 
positive posited laws For the judge this may be a predicament and he is only too likely to 
protest that the single act demanded of him is not his to perform but is the business of the 
legislator 
And indeed before we come to any conclusion about the success or failure of the Jerusalem 
court we must stress the judges firm belief that they had no right to become legislators that they 
had to conduct their business within the limits of Israeli law on the one side and of accepted 
legal opinion on the other It must be admitted furthermore that their failures were neither in kind 
nor in degree greater than the failures of the Nuremberg Trials or the Successor trials in other 
European countries On the contrary part of the failure of the Jerusalem court was due to its all 
too eager adherence to the Nuremberg precedent wherever possible 
In sum the failure of the Jerusalem court consisted in its not coming to grips with three 
fundamental issues all of which have been sufficiently well known and widely discussed since the 
establishment of the Nuremberg Tribunal the problem of impaired justice in the court of the 
victors a valid definition of the crime against humanity and a clear recognition of the new 
criminal who commits this crime 
As to the first of these justice was more seriously impaired in Jerusalem than it was at 
Nuremberg because the court did not admit witnesses for the defense In terms of the traditional 
requirements for fair and due process of law this was the most serious flaw in the Jerusalem 
proceedings Moreover while judgment in the court of the victors was perhaps inevitable at the 
close of the war to Justice Jacksons argument in Nuremberg Either the victors must judge the 
vanquished or we must leave the defeated to judge themselves should be added the 
understandable feeling on the part of the Allies that they who had risked everything could not 
admit neutrals Vabres it was not the same sixteen years later and under circumstances in 
which the argument against the admission of neutral countries did not make sense 
As to the second issue the findings of the Jerusalem court were incomparably better than those 
at Nuremberg I have mentioned before the Nuremberg Charters definition of crimes against 
humanity as inhuman acts which were translated into German as Verbrechen gegen die 
Menschlichkeit  as though the Nazis had simply been lacking in human kindness certainly the 
understatement of the century To be sure had the conduct of the Jerusalem trial depended 
entirely upon the prosecution the basic misunderstanding would have been even worse than at 
Nuremberg But the judgment refused to let the basic character of the crime be swallowed up in a 
flood of atrocities and it did not fall into the trap of equating this crime with ordinary war crimes 
What had been mentioned at Nuremberg only occasionally and as it were marginally  that the 
evidence shows that    the mass murders and cruelties were not committed solely for the 
purpose of stamping out opposition but were part of a plan to get rid of whole native 
populations  was in the center of the Jerusalem proceedings for the obvious reason that 
Eichmann stood accused of a crime against the Jewish people a crime that could not be 
explained by any utilitarian purpose Jews had been murdered all over Europe not only in the 
East and their annihilation was not due to any desire to gain territory that could be used for 
colonization by Germans It was the great advantage of a trial centered on the crime against the 
Jewish people that not only did the difference between war crimes such as shooting of partisans 
and killing of hostages and inhuman acts such as expulsion and annihilation of native 
populations to permit colonization by an invader emerge with sufficient clarity to become part of a 
future international penal code but also that the difference between inhuman acts which were 
undertaken for some known though criminal purpose such as expansion through colonization 
and the crime against humanity whose intent and purpose were unprecedented was clarified 
At no point however either in the proceedings or in the judgment did the Jerusalem trial ever 
mention even the possibility that extermination of whole ethnic groups  the Jews or the Poles or 

the Gypsies  might be more than a crime against the Jewish or the Polish or the Gypsy people 
that the international order and mankind in its entirety might have been grievously hurt and 
endangered 
Closely connected with this failure was the conspicuous helplessness the judges experienced 
when they were confronted with the task they could least escape the task of understanding the 
criminal whom they had come to judge Clearly it was not enough that they did not follow the 
prosecution in its obviously mistaken description of the accused as a perverted sadist nor 
would it have been enough if they had gone one step further and shown the inconsistency of the 
case for the prosecution in which Mr Hausner wanted to try the most abnormal monster the 
world had ever seen and at the same time try in him many like him even the whole Nazi 
movement and antiSemitism at large They knew of course that it would have been very 
comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster even though if he had been Israels 
case against him would have collapsed or at the very least lost all interest Surely one can 
hardly call upon the whole world and gather correspondents from the four corners of the earth in 
order to display Bluebeard in the dock The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many 
were like him and that the many  were neither perverted nor sadistic that they were and still are 
terribly an terrifyingly normal From the viewpoint of our legal institutions and of our moral 
standards of judgment this normality was much more terrifying than all the atrocities put together 
for it implied  as had been said at Nuremberg over and over again by the defendants and their 
counsels  that this new type of criminal who is in actual act hostis generis humani commits his 
crime  under circumstances that make it wellnigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he is 
doing wrong In this respect the evidence in the Eichmann case was even more convincing than 
the evidence presented in the trial of the major war criminals whose pleas of a clear conscience 
could be dismissed more easily because they combined with the argument of obedience to 
superior orders various boasts about occasional disobedience But although the bad faith of the 
defendants was manifest the only ground on which guilty conscience could actually be proved 
was the fact that the Nazis and especially the criminal organizations to which Eichmann 
belonged had been so very busy destroying the evidence of their crimes during the last months 
of the war And this ground was rather shaky It proved no more than recognition that the law of 
mass murder because of its novelty was not yet accepted by other nations or in the language 
of the Nazis that they had lost their fight to liberate mankind from the rule of subhumans 
especially from the domination of the Elders of Zion or in ordinary language it proved no more 
than the admission of defeat Would any one of them have suffered from a guilty conscience if 
they had won 
Foremost among the larger issues at stake in the Eichmann trial was the assumption current in all 
modern legal systems that intent to do wrong is necessary for the commission of a crime On 
nothing perhaps has civilized jurisprudence prided itself more than on this taking into account of 
the subjective factor Where this intent is absent where for whatever reasons even reasons of 
moral insanity the ability to distinguish between right and wrong is impaired we feel no crime has 
been committed We refuse and consider as barbaric the propositions that a great crime 
offends nature so that the very earth cries out for vengeance that evil violates a natural harmony 
which only retribution can restore that a wronged collectivity owes a duty to the moral order to 
punish the criminal Yosal Rogat And yet I think it is undeniable that it was precisely on the 
ground of these longforgotten propositions that Eichmann was brought to justice to begin with 
and that they were in fact the supreme justification for the death penalty Because he had been 
implicated and had played a central role in an enterprise whose open purpose was to eliminate 
forever certain races from the surface of the earth he had to be eliminated And if it is true that 
justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done then the justice of what was done in 
Jerusalem would have emerged to be seen by all if the judges had dared to address their 
defendant in something like the following terms 
 
You admitted that the crime committed against the Jewish people during the war was the 
greatest crime in recorded history and you admitted your role in it But you said you had never 
acted from base motives that you had never had any inclination to kill anybody that you had 
never hated Jews and still that you could not have acted otherwise and that you did not feel 
guilty We find this difficult though not altogether impossible to believe there is some though not 

very much evidence against you in this matter of motivation and conscience that could be proved 
beyond reasonable doubt You also said that your role in the Final Solution was an accident and 
that almost anybody could have taken your place so that potentially almost all Germans are 
equally guilty What you meant to say was that where all or most all are guilty nobody is This is 
an indeed quite common conclusion but one we are not willing to grant you And if you dont 
understand our objection we would recommend to your attention the story of Sodom and 
Gomorrah two neighboring cities in the Bible which were destroyed by fire from Heaven because 
all the people in them had become equally guilty This incidentally has nothing to do with the 
newfangled notion of collective guilt according to which people supposedly are guilty of or feel 
guilty about things done in their name but not by them  things in which they did not participate 
and from which they did not profit In other words guilt and innocence before the law are of an 
objective nature and even if eighty million Germans had done as you did this would not have 
been an excuse for you 
Luckily we dont have to go that far You yourself claimed not the actuality but only the 
potentiality of equal guilt on the part of all who lived in a state whose main political purpose had 
become the commission of unheardof crimes And no matter through what accidents of exterior 
or interior circumstances you were pushed onto the road of becoming a criminal there is an 
abyss between the actuality of what you did and the potentiality of what others might have done 
We are concerned here only with what you did and not with the possible noncriminal nature of 
your inner life and of your motives or with the criminal potentialities of those around you You told 
your story in terms of a hardluck story and knowing the circumstances we are up to a point 
willing to grant you that under more favorable circumstances it is highly unlikely that you would 
ever have come before us or before any other criminal court Let us assume for the sake of 
argument that it was nothing more than misfortune that made you a willing instrument in the 
organization of mass murder there still remains the fact that you have carried out and therefore 
actively supported a policy of mass murder For politics is not like the nursery in politics 
obedience and Support are the same And just as you supported and carried out a policy of not 
wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations  
as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not 
inhabit the world  we find that no one that is no member of the human race can be expected to 
want to share the earth with you This is the reason and the only reason you must hang 
 
 
 
Postscript 
 
 
This book contains a trial report and its main source is the transcript of the trial proceedings 
which was distributed to the press in Jerusalem Save for the opening speech of the prosecution 
and the general plea of the defense the record of the trial has not been published and is not 
easily accessible The language of the courtroom was Hebrew the materials handed to the press 
were stated to be an unedited and unrevised transcript of the simultaneous translation that 
should not be regarded as stylistically perfect or devoid of linguistic errors I have used the 
English version throughout except in those instances when the proceedings were conducted in 
German when the German transcript contained the original wording I felt free to use my own 
translation 
Except for the prosecutors introductory speech and for the final verdict the translations of which 
were prepared outside the courtroom independently of the simultaneous translation none of 
these records can be regarded as absolutely reliable The only authoritative version is the official 
record in Hebrew which I have not used Nevertheless all this material was officially given to the 
reporters for their use and so far as I know no significant discrepancies between the official 
Hebrew record and the translation have yet been pointed out The German simultaneous 
translation was very poor but it may be assumed that the English and French translations are 
trustworthy 
No such doubts about the dependability of the sources arise in connection with the following 
courtroom materials which  with one exception  were also given to the press by the Jerusalem 

authorities 
 
 The transcript in German of Eichmanns interrogation by the police recorded on tape then 
typed and the typescript presented to Eichmann who corrected it in his own hand Along with the 
transcript of the courtroom proceedings this is the most important of the documents 
 The documents submitted by the prosecution and the legal material made available by the 
prosecution  
 The sixteen sworn affidavits by witnesses originally called by the defense although part of their 
testimony was subsequently used by the prosecution These witnesses were Erich von dem 
BachZelewski Richard Baer Kurt Becher Horst Grell Dr Wilhelm Httl Walter Huppenkothen 
Hans Jttner Herbert Kappler Hermann Krumey Franz Novak Alfred Josef Slawik Dr Max 
Merten Professor Alfred Six Dr Eberhard von Thadden Dr Edmund Veesenmayer Otto 
Winkelmann  
 Finally I also had at my disposal a manuscript of seventy typewritten pages written by 
Eichmann himself It was submitted as evidence by the prosecution and accepted by the court 
but not made available to the press Its heading reads in translation Re My comments on the 
matter of Jewish questions and measures of the National Socialist Government of the German 
Reich with regard to solution of this matter during the years  to   This manuscript 
contains notes made by Eichmann in Argentina in preparation for the Sassen interview see 
Bibliography 
The Bibliography lists only the material I actually used not the innumerable books articles and 
newspaper stories I read and collected during the two years between Eichmanns kidnaping and 
his execution I regret this incompleteness only in regard to the reports of correspondents in the 
German Swiss French English and American press since these were often on a far higher 
level than the more pretentious treatments of the subject in books and magazines but it would 
have been a disproportionately large task to fill this gap I have therefore contented myself with 
adding to the Bibliography of this revised edition a selected number of books and magazine 
articles which appeared after the publication of my book if they contained more than a rehashed 
version of the case for the prosecution Among them are two accounts of the trial that often come 
to conclusions astonishingly similar to my own and a study of the prominent figures in the Third 
Reich which I have now added to my sources for background material These are Robert 
Pendorfs Murder and Ermordete Eichmann and die Judenpolitik des Dritten Reiches which also 
takes into account the role of the Jewish Councils in the Final Solution Strafsache  by the 
Dutch correspondent Harry Mulisch I used the German translation who is almost the only writer 
on the subject to put the person of the defendant at the center of his report and whose evaluation 
of Eichmann coincides with my own on some essential points and finally the excellent recently 
published portraits of leading Nazis by T C Fest in his Das Gesicht des Dritten Reiches Fest is 
very knowledgeable and his judgments are on a remarkably high level 
The problems faced by the writer of a report may best be compared with those attendant on the 
writing of a historical monograph In either case the nature of the work requires a deliberate 
distinction between the use of primary and secondary material Primary sources only may be 
used in the treatment of the special subject  in this case the trial itself  while secondary material 
is drawn upon for everything that constitutes the historical background Thus even the 
documents I have quoted were with very few exceptions presented in evidence at the trial in 
which case they constituted my primary sources or are drawn from authoritative books dealing 
with the period in question As can be seen from the text I have used Gerald Reitlingers The 
Final Solution and I have relied even more on Raul Hilbergs The Destruction of the European 
Jews which appeared after the trial and constitutes the most exhaustive and the most soundly 
documented account of the Third Reichs Jewish policies 
 
Even before its publication this book became both the center of a controversy and the object of 
an organized campaign It is only natural that the campaign conducted with all the wellknown 
means of imagemaking and opinionmanipulation got much more attention than the controversy 
so that the latter was somehow swallowed up by and drowned in the artificial noise of the former 
This became especially clear when a strange mixture of the two in almost identical phraseology  
as though the pieces written against the book and more frequently against its author came out 

of a mimeographing machine Mary McCarthy  was carried from America to England and then 
to Europe where the book was not yet even available And this was possible because the clamor 
centered on the image of a book which was never written and touched upon subjects that often 
had not only not been mentioned by me but had never occurred to me before 
The debate  if that is what it was  was by no means devoid of interest Manipulations of opinion 
insofar as they are inspired by welldefined interests have limited goals their effect however if 
they happen to touch upon an issue of authentic concern is no longer subject to their control and 
may easily produce consequences they never foresaw or intended It now appeared that the era 
of the Hitler regime with its gigantic unprecedented crimes constituted an unmastered past not 
only for the German people or for the Jews all over the world but for the rest of the world which 
had not forgotten this great catastrophe in the heart of Europe either and had also been unable 
to come to terms with it Moreover  and this was perhaps even less expected  general moral 
questions with all their intricacies and modern complexities which I would never have suspected 
would haunt mens minds today and weigh heavily on their hearts stood suddenly in the 
foreground of public concern 
The controversy began by calling attention to the conduct of the Jewish people during the years 
of the Final Solution thus following up the question first raised by the Israeli prosecutor of 
whether the Jews could or should have defended themselves I had dismissed that question as 
silly and cruel since it testified to a fatal ignorance of the conditions at the time It has now been 
discussed to exhaustion and the most amazing conclusions have been drawn The wellknown 
historicosociological construct of a ghetto mentality which in Israel has taken its place in 
history textbooks and in this country has been espoused chiefly by the psychologist Bruno 
Bettelheim  against the furious protest of official American Judaism has been repeatedly 
dragged in to explain behavior which was not at all confined to the Jewish people and which 
therefore cannot be explained by specifically Jewish factors The suggestions proliferated until 
someone who evidently found the whole discussion too dull had the brilliant idea of evoking 
Freudian theories and attributing to the whole Jewish people a death wish  unconscious of 
course This was the unexpected conclusion certain reviewers chose to draw from the image of 
a book created by certain interest groups in which I allegedly had claimed that the Jews had 
murdered themselves And why had I told such a monstrously implausible lie Out of self
hatred of course 
Since the role of the Jewish leadership had come up at the trial and since I had reported and 
commented on it it was inevitable that it too should be discussed This in my opinion is a 
serious question but the debate has contributed little to its clarification As can be seen from the 
recent trial in Israel at which a certain Hirsch Birnblat a former chief of the Jewish police in a 
Polish town and now a conductor at the Israeli Opera first was sentenced by a district court to 
five years imprisonment and then was exonerated by the Supreme Court in Jerusalem whose 
unanimous opinion indirectly exonerated the Jewish Councils in general the Jewish 
Establishment is bitterly divided on this issue In the debate however the most vocal participants 
were those who either identified the Jewish people with its leadership  in striking contrast to the 
clear distinction made in almost all the reports of survivors which may be summed up in the 
words of a former inmate of Theresienstadt The Jewish people as a whole behaved 
magnificently Only the leadership failed  or justified the Jewish functionaries by citing all the 
commendable services they had rendered before the war and above all before the era of the 
Final Solution as though there were no difference between helping Jews to emigrate and helping 
the Nazis to deport them 
While these issues had indeed some connection with this book although they were inflated out of 
all proportion there were others which had no relation to it whatsoever There was for instance a 
hot discussion of the German resistance movement from the beginning of the Hitler regime on 
which I naturally did not discuss since the question of Eichmanns conscience and that of the 
situation around him relates only to the period of the war and the Final Solution But there were 
more fantastic items Quite a number of people began to debate the question of whether the 
victims of persecution may not always be uglier than their murderers or whether anyone who 
was not present is entitled to sit in judgment over the past or whether the defendant or the 
victim holds the center of the stage in a trial On the latter point some went so far as to assert not 
only that I was wrong in being interested in what kind of person Eichmann was but that he should 

not have been allowed to speak at all  that is presumably that the trial should have been 
conducted without any defense 
As is frequently the case in discussions that are conducted with a great show of emotion the 
downtoearth interests of certain groups whose excitement is entirely concerned with factual 
matters and who therefore try to distort the facts become quickly and inextricably involved with 
the untrammeled inspirations of intellectuals who on the contrary are not in the least interested 
in facts but treat them merely as a springboard for ideas But even in these sham battles there 
could often be detected a certain seriousness a degree of authentic concern and this even in the 
contributions by people who boasted that they had not read the book and promised that they 
never would read it 
Compared with these debates which wandered so far afield the book itself dealt with a sadly 
limited subject The report of a trial can discuss only the matters which were treated in the course 
of the trial or which in the interests of justice should have been treated If the general situation of 
a country in which the trial takes place happens to be important to the conduct of the trial it too 
must be taken into account This book then does not deal with the history of the greatest 
disaster that ever befell the Jewish people nor is it an account of totalitarianism or a history of 
the German people in the time of the Third Reich nor is it finally and least of all a theoretical 
treatise on the nature of evil The focus of every trial is upon the person of the defendant a man 
of flesh and blood with an individual history with an always unique set of qualities peculiarities 
behavior patterns and circumstances All the things that go beyond that such as the history of 
the Jewish people in the dispersion and of antiSemitism or the conduct of the German people 
and other peoples or the ideologies of the time and the governmental apparatus of the Third 
Reich affect the trial only insofar as they form the background and the conditions under which the 
defendant committed his acts All the things that the defendant did not come into contact with or 
that did not influence him must be omitted from the proceedings of the trial and consequently 
from the report on it 
It may be argued that all the general questions we involuntarily raise as soon as we begin to 
speak of these matters  why did it have to be the Germans why did it have to be the Jews 
what is the nature of totalitarian rule  are far more important than the question of the kind of 
crime for which a man is being tried and the nature of the defendant upon whom justice must be 
pronounced more important too than the question of how well our present system of justice is 
capable of dealing with this special type of crime and criminal it has had repeatedly to cope with 
since the Second World War It can be held that the issue is no longer a particular human being 
a single distinct individual in the dock but rather the German people in general or antiSemitism 
in all its forms or the whole of modern history or the nature of man and original sin  so that 
ultimately the entire human race sits invisibly beside the defendant in the dock All this has often 
been argued and especially by those who will not rest until they have discovered an Eichmann 
in every one of us If the defendant is taken as a symbol and the trial as a pretext to bring up 
matters which are apparently more interesting than the guilt or innocence of one person then 
consistency demands that we bow to the assertion made by Eichmann and his lawyer that he 
was brought to book because a scapegoat was needed not only for the German Federal 
Republic but also for the events as a whole and for what made them possible  that is for anti
Semitism and totalitarian government as well as for the human race and original sin 
I need scarcely say that I would never have gone to Jerusalem if I had shared these views I held 
and hold the opinion that this trial had to take place in the interests of justice and nothing else I 
also think the judges were quite right when they stressed in their verdict that the State of Israel 
was established and recognized as the State of the Jews and therefore had jurisdiction over a 
crime committed against the Jewish people and in view of the current confusion in legal circles 
about the meaning and usefulness of punishment I was glad that the judgment quoted Grotius 
who for his part citing an older author explained that punishment is necessary to defend the 
honor or the authority of him who was hurt by the offence so that the failure to punish may not 
cause his degradation 
There is of course no doubt that the defendant and the nature of his acts as well as the trial itself 
raise problems of a general nature which go far beyond the matters considered in Jerusalem I 
have attempted to go into some of these problems in the Epilogue which ceases to be simple 
reporting I would not have been surprised if people had found my treatment inadequate and I 

would have welcomed a discussion of the general significance of the entire body of facts which 
could have been all the more meaningful the more directly it referred to the concrete events I 
also can well imagine that an authentic controversy might have arisen over the subtitle of the 
book for when I speak of the banality of evil I do so only on the strictly factual level pointing to a 
phenomenon which stared one in the face at the trial Eichmann was not lago and not Macbeth 
and nothing would have been farther from his mind than to determine with Richard III to prove a 
villain Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement he had 
no motives at all And this diligence in itself was in no way criminal he certainly would never have 
murdered his superior in order to inherit his post He merely to put the matter colloquially never 
realized what he was doing It was precisely this lack of imagination which enabled him to sit for 
months on end facing a German Jew who was conducting the police interrogation pouring out his 
heart to the man and explaining again and again how it was that he reached only the rank of 
lieutenant colonel in the SS and that it had not been his fault that he was not promoted In 
principle he knew quite well what it was all about and in his final statement to the court he spoke 
of the revaluation of values prescribed by the Nazi government He was not stupid It was 
sheer thoughtlessness  something by no means identical with stupidity  that predisposed him to 
become one of the greatest criminals of that period And if this is banal and even funny if with 
the best will in the world one cannot extract any diabolical or demonic profundity from Eichmann 
that is still far from calling it commonplace It surely cannot be so common that a man facing 
death and moreover standing beneath the gallows should be able to think of nothing but what 
he has heard at funerals all his life and that these lofty words should completely becloud the 
reality  of his own death That such remoteness from reality and such thoughtlessness can wreak 
more havoc than all the evil instincts taken together which perhaps are inherent in man  that 
was in fact the lesson one could learn in Jerusalem But it was a lesson neither an explanation 
of the phenomenon nor a theory about it 
Seemingly more complicated but in reality far simpler than examining the strange 
interdependence of thoughtlessness and evil is the question of what kind of crime is actually 
involved here   a crime moreover which all agree is unprecedented For the concept of 
genocide introduced explicitly to cover a crime unknown before although applicable up to a point 
is not fully adequate for the simple reason that massacres of whole peoples are not 
unprecedented They were the order of the day in antiquity and the centuries of colonization and 
imperialism provide plenty of examples of more or less successful attempts of that sort The 
expression administrative massacres seems better to fill the bill The term arose in connection 
with British imperialism the English deliberately rejected such procedures as a means of 
maintaining their rule over India The phrase has the virtue of dispelling the prejudice that such 
monstrous acts can be committed only against a foreign nation or a different race There is the 
wellknown fact that Hitler began his mass murders by granting mercy deaths to the incurably 
ill and that he intended to wind up his extermination program by doing away with genetically 
damaged Germans heart and lung patients But quite aside from that it is apparent that this 
sort of killing can be directed against any given group that is that the principle of selection is 
dependent only upon circumstantial factors It is quite conceivable that in the automated economy 
of a nottoodistant future men may be tempted to exterminate all those whose intelligence 
quotient is below a certain level 
In Jerusalem this matter was inadequately discussed because it is actually very difficult to grasp 
juridically We heard the protestations of the defense that Eichmann was after all only a tiny cog 
in the machinery of the Final Solution and of the prosecution which believed it had discovered in 
Eichmann the actual motor I myself attributed no more importance to both theories than did the 
Jerusalem court since the whole cog theory is legally pointless and therefore it does not matter at 
all what order of magnitude is assigned to the cog named Eichmann In its judgment the court 
naturally conceded that such a crime could be committed only by a giant bureaucracy using the 
resources of government But insofar as it remains a crime  and that of course is the premise 
for a trial  all the cogs in the machinery no matter how insignificant are in court forthwith 
transformed back into perpetrators that is to say into human beings If the defendant excuses 
himself on the ground that he acted not as a man but as a mere functionary whose functions 
could just as easily have been carried out by an one else it is as if a criminal pointed to the 
statistics on crime  which set forth that soandso many crimes per day are committed in such

andsuch a place  and declared that he only did what was statistically expected that it was mere 
accident that he did it and not somebody else since after all somebody had to do it 
Of course it is important to the political and social sciences that the essence of totalitarian 
government and perhaps the nature of every bureaucracy is to make functionaries and mere 
cogs in the administrative machinery out of men and thus to dehumanize them And one can 
debate long and profitably on the rule of Nobody which is what the political form known as 
bureaucracy truly is Only one must realize clearly that the administration of justice can consider 
these factors only to the extent that they are circumstances of the crime  just as in a case of 
theft the economic plight of the thief is taken into account without excusing the theft let alone 
wiping it off the slate True we have become very much accustomed by modern psychology and 
sociology not to speak of modern bureaucracy to explaining away the responsibility of the doer 
for his deed in terms of this or that kind of determinism Whether such seemingly deeper 
explanations of human actions are right or wrong is debatable But what is not debatable is that 
no judicial procedure would be possible on the basis of them and that the administration of 
justice measured by such theories is an extremely unmodern not to say outmoded institution 
When Hitler said that a day would come in Germany when it would be considered a disgrace to 
be a jurist he was speaking with utter consistency of his dream of a perfect bureaucracy 
As far as I can see jurisprudence has at its disposal for treating this whole battery of questions 
only two categories both of which to my mind are quite inadequate to deal with the matter 
These are the concepts of acts of state and of acts on superior orders At any rate these are 
the only categories in terms of which such matters are discussed in this kind of trial usually on 
the motion of the defendant The theory of the act of state is based on the argument that one 
sovereign state may not sit in judgment upon another par in parem non habet jurisdictionem 
Practically speaking this argument had already been disposed of at Nuremberg it stood no 
chance from the start since if it were accepted even Hitler the only one who was really 
responsible in the full sense could not have been brought to account  a state of affairs which 
would have violated the most elementary sense of justice However an argument that stands no 
chance on the practical plane has not necessarily been demolished on the theoretical one The 
usual evasions  that Germany at the time of the Third Reich was dominated by a gang of 
criminals to whom sovereignty and parity cannot very well be ascribed  were hardly useful For 
on the one hand everyone knows that the analogy with a gang of criminals is applicable only to 
such a limited extent that it is not really applicable at all and on the other hand these crimes 
undeniably took place within a legal order That indeed was their outstanding characteristic 
Perhaps we can approach somewhat closer to the matter if we realize that back of the concept of 
act of state stands the theory of raison dtat According to that theory the actions of the state 
which is responsible for the life of the country and thus also for the laws obtaining in it are not 
subject to the same rules as the acts of the citizens of the country Just as the rule of law 
although devised to eliminate violence and the war of all against all always stands in need of the 
instruments of violence in order to assure its own existence so a government may find itself 
compelled to commit actions that are generally regarded as crimes in order to assure its own 
survival and the survival of lawfulness Wars are frequently justified on these grounds but 
criminal acts of state do not occur only in the field of international relations and the history of 
civilized nations knows many examples of them  from Napoleons assassination of the Due 
dEnghien to the murder of the Socialist leader Matteotti for which Mussolini himself was 
presumably responsible 
Raison dtat appeals  rightly or wrongly as the case may be  to necessity and the state crimes 
committed in its name which are fully criminal in terms of the dominant legal system of the 
country where they occur are considered emergency measures concessions made to the 
stringencies of Realpolitik in order to preserve power and thus assure the continuance of the 
existing legal order as a whole In a normal political and legal system such crimes occur as an 
exception to the rule and are not subject to legal penalty are gerichtsfrei as German legal theory 
expresses it because the existence of the state itself is at stake and no outside political entity 
has the right to deny a state its existence or prescribe how it is to preserve it However  as we 
may have learned from the history of Jewish policy in the Third Reich  in a state founded upon 
criminal principles the situation is reversed Then a noncriminal act such as for example 
Himmlers order in the late summer of  to halt the deportation of Jews becomes a 

concession to necessity imposed by reality in this case the impending defeat Here the question 
arises what is the nature of the sovereignty of such an entity Has it not violated the parity par in 
parem non ha bet jurisdictionem which international law accords it Does the par in parem 
signify no more than the paraphernalia of sovereignty Or does it also imply a substantive 
equality or likeness Can we apply the same principle that is applied to a governmental 
apparatus in which crime and violence are exceptions and borderline cases to a political order in 
which crime is legal and the rule 
Just how inadequate juristic concepts really are to deal with the criminal facts which were the 
subject matter of all these trials appears perhaps even more strikingly in the concept of acts 
performed on superior orders The Jerusalem court countered the argument advanced by the 
defense with lengthy quotations from the penal and military lawbooks of civilized countries 
particularly of Germany for under Hitler the pertinent articles had by no means been repealed All 
of them agree on one point manifestly criminal orders must not be obeyed The court moreover 
referred to a case that came up in Israel several years ago soldiers were brought to trial for 
having massacred the civilian inhabitants of an Arab village on the border shortly before the 
beginning of the Sinai campaign The villagers had been found outside their houses during a 
military curfew of which it appeared they were unaware Unfortunately on closer examination 
the comparison appears to be defective on two accounts First of all we must again consider that 
the relationship of exception and rule which is of prime importance for recognizing the criminality 
of an order executed by a subordinate was reversed in the case of Eichmanns actions Thus on 
the basis of this argument one could actually defend Eichmanns failure to obey certain of 
Himmlers orders or his obeying them with hesitancy they were manifest exceptions to the 
prevailing rule The judgment found this to be especially incriminating to the defendant which 
was certainly very understandable but not very consistent This can easily be seen from the 
pertinent findings of Israeli military courts which were cited in support by the judges They ran as 
follows the order to be disobeyed must be manifestly unlawful unlawfulness should fly like a 
black flag above it as a warning reading Prohibited  In other words the order to be 
recognized by the soldier as manifestly unlawful must violate by its unusualness the canons of 
the legal system to which he is accustomed And Israeli jurisprudence in these matters coincides 
completely with that of other countries No doubt in formulating these articles the legislators were 
thinking of cases in which an officer who suddenly goes mad say commands his subordinates to 
kill another officer In any normal trial of such a case it would at once become clear that the 
soldier was not being asked to consult the voice of conscience or a feeling of lawfulness that 
lies deep within every human conscience also of those who are not conversant with books of law 
   provided the eye is not blind and the heart is not stony and corrupt Rather the soldier would 
be expected to be able to distinguish between a rule and a striking exception to the rule The 
German military code at any rate explicitly states that conscience is not enough Paragraph  
reads Punishability of an action or omission is not excluded on the ground that the person 
considered his behavior required by his conscience or the prescripts of his religion A striking 
feature of the Israeli courts line of argument is that the concept of a sense of justice grounded in 
the depths of every man is presented solely as a substitute for familiarity with the law Its 
plausibility rests on the assumption that the law expresses only what every mans conscience 
would tell him anyhow 
If we are to apply this whole reasoning to the Eichmann case in a meaningful way we are forced 
to conclude that Eichmann acted fully within the framework of the kind of judgment required of 
him he acted in accordance with the rule examined the order issued to him for its manifest 
legality namely regularity he did not have to fall back upon his conscience since he was not 
one of those who were unfamiliar with the laws of his country The exact opposite was the case 
The second account on which the argument based on comparison proved to be defective 
concerns the practice of the courts of admitting the plea of superior orders as important 
extenuating circumstances and this practice was mentioned explicitly by the judgment The 
judgment cited the case I have mentioned above that of the massacre of the Arab inhabitants at 
Kfar Kassem as proof that Israeli jurisdiction does not clear a defendant of responsibility for the 
superior orders he received And it is true the Israeli soldiers were indicted for murder but 
superior orders constituted so weighty an argument for mitigating circumstances that they were 
sentenced to relatively short prison terms To be sure this case concerned an isolated act not  

as in Eichmanns case  an activity extending over years in which crime followed crime Still it 
was undeniable that he had always acted upon superior orders and if the provisions of ordinary 
Israeli law had been applied to him it would have been difficult indeed to impose the maximum 
penalty upon him The truth of the matter is that Israeli law in theory and practice like the 
jurisdiction of other countries cannot but admit that the fact of superior orders even when their 
unlawfulness is manifest can severely disturb the normal working of a mans conscience 
 
This is only one example among many to demonstrate the inadequacy of the prevailing legal 
system and of current juridical concepts to deal with the facts of administrative massacres 
organized by the state apparatus If we look more closely into the matter we will observe without 
much difficulty that the judges in all these trials really passed judgment solely on the basis of the 
monstrous deeds In other words they judged freely as it were and did not really lean on the 
standards and legal precedents with which they more or less convincingly sought to justify their 
decisions That was already evident in Nuremberg where the judges on the one hand declared 
that the crime against peace was the gravest of all the crimes they had to deal with since it 
included all the other crimes but on the other hand actually imposed the death penalty only on 
those defendants who had participated in the new crime of administrative massacre  supposedly 
a less grave offense than conspiracy against peace It would indeed be tempting to pursue these 
and similar inconsistencies in a field so obsessed with consistency as jurisprudence But of 
course that cannot be done here 
There remains however one fundamental problem which was implicitly present in all these 
postwar trials and which must be mentioned here because it touches upon one of the central 
moral questions of all time namely upon the nature and function of human judgment What we 
have demanded in these trials where the defendants had committed legal crimes is that 
human beings be capable of telling right from wrong even when all they have to guide them is 
their own judgment which moreover happens to be completely at odds with what they must 
regard as the unanimous opinion of all those around them And this question is all the more 
serious as we know that the few who were arrogant enough to trust only their own judgment 
were by no means identical with those persons who continued to abide by old values or who 
were guided by a religious belief Since the whole of respectable society had in one way or 
another succumbed to Hitler the moral maxims which determine social behavior and the religious 
commandments  Thou shalt not kill  which guide conscience had virtually vanished Those 
few who were still able to tell right from wrong went really only by their own judgments and they 
did so freely there were no rules to be abided by under which the particular cases with which 
they were confronted could be subsumed They had to decide each instance as it arose because 
no rules existed for the unprecedented 
How troubled men of our time are by this question of judgment or as is often said by people 
who dare sit in judgment has emerged in the controversy over the present book as well as the 
in many respects similar controversy over Hochhuths The Deputy What has come to light is 
neither nihilism nor cynicism as one might have expected but a quite extraordinary confusion 
over elementary questions of morality  as if an instinct in such matters were truly the last thing to 
be taken for granted in our time The many curious notes that have been struck in the course of 
these disputes seem particularly revealing Thus some American literati have professed their 
naive belief that temptation and coercion are really the same thing that no one can be asked to 
resist temptation If someone puts a pistol to your heart and orders you to shoot your best friend 
then you simply must shoot him Or as it was argued  some years ago in connection with the 
quiz program scandal in which a university teacher had hoaxed the public  when so much money 
is at stake who could possibly resist The argument that we cannot judge if we were not present 
and involved ourselves seems to convince everyone everywhere although it seems obvious that 
if it were true neither the administration of justice nor the writing of history would ever be 
possible In contrast to these confusions the reproach of selfrighteousness raised against those 
who do judge is ageold but that does not make it any the more valid Even the judge who 
condemns a murderer can still say when he goes home And there but for the grace of God go 
I All German Jews unanimously have condemned the wave of coordination which passed over 
the German people in  and from one day to the next turned the Jews into pariahs Is it 
conceivable that none of them ever asked himself how many of his own group would have done 

just the same if only they had been allowed to But is their condemnation today any the less 
correct for that reason 
The reflection that you yourself might have done wrong under the same circumstances may 
kindle a spirit of forgiveness but those who today refer to Christian charity seem strangely 
confused on this issue too Thus we can read in the postwar statement of the Evangelische 
Kirche in Deutschland the Protestant church as follows We aver that before the God of Mercy 
we share in the guilt for the outrage committed against the Jews by our own people through 
omission and silence It seems to me that a Christian is guilty before the God of Mercy if he 
repays evil with evil hence that the churches would have sinned against mercy if millions of Jews 
had been killed as punishment for some evil they committed But if the churches shared in the 
guilt for an outrage pure and simple as they themselves attest then the matter must still be 
considered to fall within the purview of the God of Justice 
This slip of the tongue as it were is no accident Justice but not mercy is a matter of judgment 
and about nothing does public opinion everywhere seem to be in happier agreement than that no 
one has the right to judge somebody else What public opinion permits us to judge and even to 
condemn are trends or whole groups of people  the larger the better  in short something so 
general that distinctions can no longer be made names no longer be named Needless to add 
this taboo applies doubly when the deeds or words of famous people or men in high position are 
being questioned This is currently expressed in highflown assertions that it is superficial to 
insist on details and to mention individuals whereas it is the sign of sophistication to speak in 
generalities according to which all cats are gray and we are all equally guilty Thus the charge 
Hochhuth has raised against a single Pope  one man easily identifiable with a name of his own 
 was immediately countered with an indictment of all Christianity The charge against Christianity 
in general with its two thousand years of history cannot be proved and if it could be proved it 
would be horrible No one seems to mind this so long as no person is involved and it is quite safe 
to go one step further and to maintain Undoubtedly there is reason for grave accusations but 
the defendant is mankind as a whole Thus Robert Weltsch in Summa Iniuria quoted above

Another such escape from the area of ascertainable facts and personal responsibility are the 
countless theories based on nonspecific abstract hypothetical assumptions  from the Zeitgeist 
down to the Oedipus complex  which are so general that they explain and justify every event and 
every deed no alternative to what actually happened is even considered and no person could 
have acted differently from the way he did act Among the constructs that explain everything by 
obscuring all details we find such notions as a ghetto mentality among European Jews or the 
collective guilt of the German people derived from an ad hoc interpretation of their history or the 
equally absurd assertion of a kind of collective innocence of the Jewish people All these clichs 
have in common that they make judgment superfluous and that to utter them is devoid of all risk 
And though we can understand the reluctance of those immediately affected by the disaster  
Germans and Jews  to examine too closely the conduct of groups and persons that seemed to 
be or should have been unimpaired by the totality of the moral collapse  that is the conduct of 
the Christian churches the Jewish leadership the men of the antiHitler conspiracy of July  
  this understandable disinclination is insufficient to explain the reluctance evident 
everywhere to make judgments in terms of individual moral responsibility 
Many people today would agree that there is no such thing as collective guilt or for that matter 
collective innocence and that if there were no one person could ever be guilty or innocent This 
of course is not to deny that there is such a thing as political responsibility which however exists 
quite apart from what the individual member of the group has done and therefore can neither be 
judged in moral terms nor be brought before a criminal court Every government assumes political 
responsibility for the deeds and misdeeds of its predecessor and every nation for the deeds and 
misdeeds of the past When Napoleon seizing power in France after the Revolution said I shall 
assume the responsibility for everything France ever did from Saint Louis to the Committee of 

Public Safety he was only stating somewhat emphatically one of the basic facts of all political life 
It means hardly more generally speaking than that every generation by virtue of being born into 
a historical continuum is burdened by the sins of the fathers as it is blessed with the deeds of the 
ancestors But this kind of responsibility is not what we are talking about here it is not personal 
and only in a metaphorical sense can one say he feels guilty for what not he but his father or his 
people have done Morally speaking it is hardly less wrong to feel guilty without having done 
something specific than it is to feel free of all guilt if one is actually guilty of something It is quite 
conceivable that certain political responsibilities among nations might some day be adjudicated in 
an international court what is inconceivable is that such a court would be a criminal tribunal 
which pronounces on the guilt or innocence of individuals 
And the question of individual guilt or innocence the act of meting out justice to both the 
defendant and the victim are the only things at stake in a criminal court The Eichmann trial was 
no exception even though the court here was confronted with a crime it could not find in the 
lawbooks and with a criminal whose like was unknown in any court at least prior to the 
Nuremberg Trials The present report deals with nothing but the extent to which the court in 
Jerusalem succeeded in fulfilling the demands of justice
