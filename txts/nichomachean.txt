nicomachean ethicsby aristotletranslated by w d rossbook i every art and every inquiry and similarly every action and pursuitis thought to aim at some good and for this reason the good has rightlybeen declared to be that at which all things aim but a certain differenceis found among ends some are activities others are products apartfrom the activities that produce them where there are ends apartfrom the actions it is the nature of the products to be better thanthe activities now as there are many actions arts and sciencestheir ends also are many the end of the medical art is health thatof shipbuilding a vessel that of strategy victory that of economicswealth but where such arts fall under a single capacity as bridlemakingand the other arts concerned with the equipment of horses fall underthe art of riding and this and every military action under strategyin the same way other arts fall under yet others in all of thesethe ends of the master arts are to be preferred to all the subordinateends for it is for the sake of the former that the latter are pursuedit makes no difference whether the activities themselves are the endsof the actions or something else apart from the activities as inthe case of the sciences just mentioned  if then there is some end of the things we do which we desire forits own sake everything else being desired for the sake of thisand if we do not choose everything for the sake of something elsefor at that rate the process would go on to infinity so that ourdesire would be empty and vain clearly this must be the good andthe chief good will not the knowledge of it then have a great influenceon life shall we not like archers who have a mark to aim at bemore likely to hit upon what is right if so we must try in outlineat least to determine what it is and of which of the sciences orcapacities it is the object it would seem to belong to the most authoritativeart and that which is most truly the master art and politics appearsto be of this nature for it is this that ordains which of the sciencesshould be studied in a state and which each class of citizens shouldlearn and up to what point they should learn them and we see eventhe most highly esteemed of capacities to fall under this eg strategyeconomics rhetoric now since politics uses the rest of the sciencesand since again it legislates as to what we are to do and what weare to abstain from the end of this science must include those ofthe others so that this end must be the good for man for even ifthe end is the same for a single man and for a state that of thestate seems at all events something greater and more complete whetherto attain or to preserve though it is worth while to attain the endmerely for one man it is finer and more godlike to attain it fora nation or for citystates these then are the ends at which ourinquiry aims since it is political science in one sense of thatterm  our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as thesubjectmatter admits of for precision is not to be sought for alikein all discussions any more than in all the products of the craftsnow fine and just actions which political science investigates admitof much variety and fluctuation of opinion so that they may be thoughtto exist only by convention and not by nature and goods also giverise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many peoplefor before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth andothers by reason of their courage we must be content then in speakingof such subjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughlyand in outline and in speaking about things which are only for themost part true and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusionsthat are no better in the same spirit therefore should each typeof statement be received for it is the mark of an educated man tolook for precision in each class of things just so far as the natureof the subject admits it is evidently equally foolish to accept probablereasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientificproofs now each man judges well the things he knows and of these he is agood judge and so the man who has been educated in a subject is agood judge of that subject and the man who has received an allroundeducation is a good judge in general hence a young man is not a properhearer of lectures on political science for he is inexperienced inthe actions that occur in life but its discussions start from theseand are about these and further since he tends to follow his passionshis study will be vain and unprofitable because the end aimed atis not knowledge but action and it makes no difference whether heis young in years or youthful in character the defect does not dependon time but on his living and pursuing each successive object aspassion directs for to such persons as to the incontinent knowledgebrings no profit but to those who desire and act in accordance witha rational principle knowledge about such matters will be of greatbenefit these remarks about the student the sort of treatment to be expectedand the purpose of the inquiry may be taken as our preface let us resume our inquiry and state in view of the fact that allknowledge and every pursuit aims at some good what it is that wesay political science aims at and what is the highest of all goodsachievable by action verbally there is very general agreement forboth the general run of men and people of superior refinement saythat it is happiness and identify living well and doing well withbeing happy but with regard to what happiness is they differ andthe many do not give the same account as the wise for the formerthink it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure wealth orhonour they differ however from one another and often even thesame man identifies it with different things with health when heis ill with wealth when he is poor but conscious of their ignorancethey admire those who proclaim some great ideal that is above theircomprehension now some thought that apart from these many goods thereis another which is selfsubsistent and causes the goodness of allthese as well to examine all the opinions that have been held wereperhaps somewhat fruitless enough to examine those that are mostprevalent or that seem to be arguable let us not fail to notice however that there is a difference betweenarguments from and those to the first principles for plato toowas right in raising this question and asking as he used to do arewe on the way from or to the first principles there is a differenceas there is in a racecourse between the course from the judges tothe turningpoint and the way back for while we must begin withwhat is known things are objects of knowledge in two senses someto us some without qualification presumably then we must beginwith things known to us hence any one who is to listen intelligentlyto lectures about what is noble and just and generally about thesubjects of political science must have been brought up in good habitsfor the fact is the startingpoint and if this is sufficiently plainto him he will not at the start need the reason as well and theman who has been well brought up has or can easily get startingpointsand as for him who neither has nor can get them let him hear thewords of hesiod far best is he who knows all things himself good he that hearkens when men counsel right but he who neither knows nor lays to heart anothers wisdom is a useless wight  let us however resume our discussion from the point at which wedigressed to judge from the lives that men lead most men and menof the most vulgar type seem not without some ground to identifythe good or happiness with pleasure which is the reason why theylove the life of enjoyment for there are we may say three prominenttypes of life that just mentioned the political and thirdly thecontemplative life now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavishin their tastes preferring a life suitable to beasts but they getsome ground for their view from the fact that many of those in highplaces share the tastes of sardanapallus a consideration of the prominenttypes of life shows that people of superior refinement and of activedisposition identify happiness with honour for this is roughly speakingthe end of the political life but it seems too superficial to bewhat we are looking for since it is thought to depend on those whobestow honour rather than on him who receives it but the good wedivine to be something proper to a man and not easily taken from himfurther men seem to pursue honour in order that they may be assuredof their goodness at least it is by men of practical wisdom thatthey seek to be honoured and among those who know them and on theground of their virtue clearly then according to them at any ratevirtue is better and perhaps one might even suppose this to be ratherthan honour the end of the political life but even this appearssomewhat incomplete for possession of virtue seems actually compatiblewith being asleep or with lifelong inactivity and further withthe greatest sufferings and misfortunes but a man who was livingso no one would call happy unless he were maintaining a thesis atall costs but enough of this for the subject has been sufficientlytreated even in the current discussions third comes the contemplativelife which we shall consider later the life of moneymaking is one undertaken under compulsion and wealthis evidently not the good we are seeking for it is merely usefuland for the sake of something else and so one might rather take theaforenamed objects to be ends for they are loved for themselvesbut it is evident that not even these are ends yet many argumentshave been thrown away in support of them let us leave this subjectthen  we had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss thoroughlywhat is meant by it although such an inquiry is made an uphill oneby the fact that the forms have been introduced by friends of ourown yet it would perhaps be thought to be better indeed to be ourduty for the sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touchesus closely especially as we are philosophers or lovers of wisdomfor while both are dear piety requires us to honour truth aboveour friends the men who introduced this doctrine did not posit ideas of classeswithin which they recognized priority and posteriority which is thereason why they did not maintain the existence of an idea embracingall numbers but the term good is used both in the category ofsubstance and in that of quality and in that of relation and thatwhich is per se ie substance is prior in nature to the relativefor the latter is like an off shoot and accident of being so thatthere could not be a common idea set over all these goods furthersince good has as many senses as being for it is predicated bothin the category of substance as of god and of reason and in qualityie of the virtues and in quantity ie of that which is moderateand in relation ie of the useful and in time ie of the rightopportunity and in place ie of the right locality and the likeclearly it cannot be something universally present in all cases andsingle for then it could not have been predicated in all the categoriesbut in one only further since of the things answering to one ideathere is one science there would have been one science of all thegoods but as it is there are many sciences even of the things thatfall under one category eg of opportunity for opportunity in waris studied by strategics and in disease by medicine and the moderatein food is studied by medicine and in exercise by the science of gymnasticsand one might ask the question what in the world they mean by athing itself is as is the case in man himself and in a particularman the account of man is one and the same for in so far as theyare man they will in no respect differ and if this is so neitherwill good itself and particular goods in so far as they are goodbut again it will not be good any the more for being eternal sincethat which lasts long is no whiter than that which perishes in a daythe pythagoreans seem to give a more plausible account of the goodwhen they place the one in the column of goods and it is they thatspeusippus seems to have followed but let us discuss these matters elsewhere an objection to what wehave said however may be discerned in the fact that the platonistshave not been speaking about all goods and that the goods that arepursued and loved for themselves are called good by reference to asingle form while those which tend to produce or to preserve thesesomehow or to prevent their contraries are called so by referenceto these and in a secondary sense clearly then goods must be spokenof in two ways and some must be good in themselves the others byreason of these let us separate then things good in themselvesfrom things useful and consider whether the former are called goodby reference to a single idea what sort of goods would one call goodin themselves is it those that are pursued even when isolated fromothers such as intelligence sight and certain pleasures and honourscertainly if we pursue these also for the sake of something elseyet one would place them among things good in themselves or is nothingother than the idea of good good in itself in that case the formwill be empty but if the things we have named are also things goodin themselves the account of the good will have to appear as somethingidentical in them all as that of whiteness is identical in snow andin white lead but of honour wisdom and pleasure just in respectof their goodness the accounts are distinct and diverse the goodtherefore is not some common element answering to one ideabut what then do we mean by the good it is surely not like the thingsthat only chance to have the same name are goods one then by beingderived from one good or by all contributing to one good or are theyrather one by analogy certainly as sight is in the body so is reasonin the soul and so on in other cases but perhaps these subjectshad better be dismissed for the present for perfect precision aboutthem would be more appropriate to another branch of philosophy andsimilarly with regard to the idea even if there is some one goodwhich is universally predicable of goods or is capable of separateand independent existence clearly it could not be achieved or attainedby man but we are now seeking something attainable perhaps howeversome one might think it worth while to recognize this with a viewto the goods that are attainable and achievable for having this asa sort of pattern we shall know better the goods that are good forus and if we know them shall attain them this argument has someplausibility but seems to clash with the procedure of the sciencesfor all of these though they aim at some good and seek to supplythe deficiency of it leave on one side the knowledge of the goodyet that all the exponents of the arts should be ignorant of andshould not even seek so great an aid is not probable it is hardtoo to see how a weaver or a carpenter will be benefited in regardto his own craft by knowing this good itself or how the man whohas viewed the idea itself will be a better doctor or general therebyfor a doctor seems not even to study health in this way but the healthof man or perhaps rather the health of a particular man it is individualsthat he is healing but enough of these topics  let us again return to the good we are seeking and ask what it canbe it seems different in different actions and arts it is differentin medicine in strategy and in the other arts likewise what thenis the good of each surely that for whose sake everything else isdone in medicine this is health in strategy victory in architecturea house in any other sphere something else and in every action andpursuit the end for it is for the sake of this that all men do whateverelse they do therefore if there is an end for all that we do thiswill be the good achievable by action and if there are more thanone these will be the goods achievable by action so the argument has by a different course reached the same pointbut we must try to state this even more clearly since there are evidentlymore than one end and we choose some of these eg wealth flutesand in general instruments for the sake of something else clearlynot all ends are final ends but the chief good is evidently somethingfinal therefore if there is only one final end this will be whatwe are seeking and if there are more than one the most final ofthese will be what we are seeking now we call that which is in itselfworthy of pursuit more final than that which is worthy of pursuitfor the sake of something else and that which is never desirablefor the sake of something else more final than the things that aredesirable both in themselves and for the sake of that other thingand therefore we call final without qualification that which is alwaysdesirable in itself and never for the sake of something elsenow such a thing happiness above all else is held to be for thiswe choose always for self and never for the sake of something elsebut honour pleasure reason and every virtue we choose indeed forthemselves for if nothing resulted from them we should still chooseeach of them but we choose them also for the sake of happinessjudging that by means of them we shall be happy happiness on theother hand no one chooses for the sake of these nor in generalfor anything other than itself from the point of view of selfsufficiency the same result seems tofollow for the final good is thought to be selfsufficient now byselfsufficient we do not mean that which is sufficient for a manby himself for one who lives a solitary life but also for parentschildren wife and in general for his friends and fellow citizenssince man is born for citizenship but some limit must be set to thisfor if we extend our requirement to ancestors and descendants andfriends friends we are in for an infinite series let us examinethis question however on another occasion the selfsufficient wenow define as that which when isolated makes life desirable and lackingin nothing and such we think happiness to be and further we thinkit most desirable of all things without being counted as one goodthing among others if it were so counted it would clearly be mademore desirable by the addition of even the least of goods for thatwhich is added becomes an excess of goods and of goods the greateris always more desirable happiness then is something final andselfsufficient and is the end of action presumably however to say that happiness is the chief good seemsa platitude and a clearer account of what it is still desired thismight perhaps be given if we could first ascertain the function ofman for just as for a fluteplayer a sculptor or an artist andin general for all things that have a function or activity the goodand the well is thought to reside in the function so would it seemto be for man if he has a function have the carpenter then andthe tanner certain functions or activities and has man none is heborn without a function or as eye hand foot and in general eachof the parts evidently has a function may one lay it down that mansimilarly has a function apart from all these what then can thisbe life seems to be common even to plants but we are seeking whatis peculiar to man let us exclude therefore the life of nutritionand growth next there would be a life of perception but it alsoseems to be common even to the horse the ox and every animal thereremains then an active life of the element that has a rational principleof this one part has such a principle in the sense of being obedientto one the other in the sense of possessing one and exercising thoughtand as life of the rational element also has two meanings we muststate that life in the sense of activity is what we mean for thisseems to be the more proper sense of the term now if the functionof man is an activity of soul which follows or implies a rationalprinciple and if we say soandsoand a good soandso have afunction which is the same in kind eg a lyre and a good lyreplayerand so without qualification in all cases eminence in respect ofgoodness being idded to the name of the function for the functionof a lyreplayer is to play the lyre and that of a good lyreplayeris to do so well if this is the case and we state the functionof man to be a certain kind of life and this to be an activity oractions of the soul implying a rational principle and the functionof a good man to be the good and noble performance of these and ifany action is well performed when it is performed in accordance withthe appropriate excellence if this is the case human good turnsout to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue and if thereare more than one virtue in accordance with the best and most completebut we must add in a complete life for one swallow does not makea summer nor does one day and so too one day or a short time doesnot make a man blessed and happy let this serve as an outline of the good for we must presumably firstsketch it roughly and then later fill in the details but it wouldseem that any one is capable of carrying on and articulating whathas once been well outlined and that time is a good discoverer orpartner in such a work to which facts the advances of the arts aredue for any one can add what is lacking and we must also rememberwhat has been said before and not look for precision in all thingsalike but in each class of things such precision as accords withthe subjectmatter and so much as is appropriate to the inquiryfor a carpenter and a geometer investigate the right angle in differentways the former does so in so far as the right angle is useful forhis work while the latter inquires what it is or what sort of thingit is for he is a spectator of the truth we must act in the sameway then in all other matters as well that our main task may notbe subordinated to minor questions nor must we demand the cause inall matters alike it is enough in some cases that the fact be wellestablished as in the case of the first principles the fact is theprimary thing or first principle now of first principles we see someby induction some by perception some by a certain habituation andothers too in other ways but each set of principles we must try toinvestigate in the natural way and we must take pains to state themdefinitely since they have a great influence on what follows forthe beginning is thought to be more than half of the whole and manyof the questions we ask are cleared up by it  we must consider it however in the light not only of our conclusionand our premisses but also of what is commonly said about it forwith a true view all the data harmonize but with a false one thefacts soon clash now goods have been divided into three classesand some are described as external others as relating to soul orto body we call those that relate to soul most properly and trulygoods and psychical actions and activities we class as relating tosoul therefore our account must be sound at least according to thisview which is an old one and agreed on by philosophers it is correctalso in that we identify the end with certain actions and activitiesfor thus it falls among goods of the soul and not among external goodsanother belief which harmonizes with our account is that the happyman lives well and does well for we have practically defined happinessas a sort of good life and good action the characteristics that arelooked for in happiness seem also all of them to belong to whatwe have defined happiness as being for some identify happiness withvirtue some with practical wisdom others with a kind of philosophicwisdom others with these or one of these accompanied by pleasureor not without pleasure while others include also external prosperitynow some of these views have been held by many men and men of oldothers by a few eminent persons and it is not probable that eitherof these should be entirely mistaken but rather that they shouldbe right in at least some one respect or even in most respectswith those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue ouraccount is in harmony for to virtue belongs virtuous activity butit makes perhaps no small difference whether we place the chiefgood in possession or in use in state of mind or in activity forthe state of mind may exist without producing any good result asin a man who is asleep or in some other way quite inactive but theactivity cannot for one who has the activity will of necessity beacting and acting well and as in the olympic games it is not themost beautiful and the strongest that are crowned but those who competefor it is some of these that are victorious so those who act winand rightly win the noble and good things in life their life is also in itself pleasant for pleasure is a state ofsoul and to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasanteg not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses and a spectacleto the lover of sights but also in the same way just acts are pleasantto the lover of justice and in general virtuous acts to the loverof virtue now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with oneanother because these are not by nature pleasant but the lovers ofwhat is noble find pleasant the things that are by nature pleasantand virtuous actions are such so that these are pleasant for suchmen as well as in their own nature their life therefore has nofurther need of pleasure as a sort of adventitious charm but hasits pleasure in itself for besides what we have said the man whodoes not rejoice in noble actions is not even good since no one wouldcall a man just who did not enjoy acting justly nor any man liberalwho did not enjoy liberal actions and similarly in all other casesif this is so virtuous actions must be in themselves pleasant butthey are also good and noble and have each of these attributes inthe highest degree since the good man judges well about these attributeshis judgement is such as we have described happiness then is thebest noblest and most pleasant thing in the world and these attributesare not severed as in the inscription at delos most noble is that which is justest and best is healthbut pleasantest is it to win what we love for all these properties belong to the best activities and theseor one the best of these we identify with happiness yet evidently as we said it needs the external goods as well forit is impossible or not easy to do noble acts without the properequipment in many actions we use friends and riches and politicalpower as instruments and there are some things the lack of whichtakes the lustre from happiness as good birth goodly children beautyfor the man who is very ugly in appearance or illborn or solitaryand childless is not very likely to be happy and perhaps a man wouldbe still less likely if he had thoroughly bad children or friendsor had lost good children or friends by death as we said then happinessseems to need this sort of prosperity in addition for which reasonsome identify happiness with good fortune though others identifyit with virtue  for this reason also the question is asked whether happiness is tobe acquired by learning or by habituation or some other sort of trainingor comes in virtue of some divine providence or again by chance nowif there is any gift of the gods to men it is reasonable that happinessshould be godgiven and most surely godgiven of all human thingsinasmuch as it is the best but this question would perhaps be moreappropriate to another inquiry happiness seems however even ifit is not godsent but comes as a result of virtue and some processof learning or training to be among the most godlike things forthat which is the prize and end of virtue seems to be the best thingin the world and something godlike and blessed it will also on this view be very generally shared for all who arenot maimed as regards their potentiality for virtue may win it bya certain kind of study and care but if it is better to be happythus than by chance it is reasonable that the facts should be sosince everything that depends on the action of nature is by natureas good as it can be and similarly everything that depends on artor any rational cause and especially if it depends on the best ofall causes to entrust to chance what is greatest and most noble wouldbe a very defective arrangement the answer to the question we are asking is plain also from the definitionof happiness for it has been said to be a virtuous activity of soulof a certain kind of the remaining goods some must necessarily preexistas conditions of happiness and others are naturally cooperativeand useful as instruments and this will be found to agree with whatwe said at the outset for we stated the end of political scienceto be the best end and political science spends most of its painson making the citizens to be of a certain character viz good andcapable of noble acts it is natural then that we call neither ox nor horse nor any otherof the animals happy for none of them is capable of sharing in suchactivity for this reason also a boy is not happy for he is not yetcapable of such acts owing to his age and boys who are called happyare being congratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them forthere is required as we said not only complete virtue but also acomplete life since many changes occur in life and all manner ofchances and the most prosperous may fall into great misfortunes inold age as is told of priam in the trojan cycle and one who hasexperienced such chances and has ended wretchedly no one calls happy must no one at all then be called happy while he lives must weas solon says see the end even if we are to lay down this doctrineis it also the case that a man is happy when he is dead or is notthis quite absurd especially for us who say that happiness is anactivity but if we do not call the dead man happy and if solon doesnot mean this but that one can then safely call a man blessed asbeing at last beyond evils and misfortunes this also affords matterfor discussion for both evil and good are thought to exist for adead man as much as for one who is alive but not aware of them eghonours and dishonours and the good or bad fortunes of children andin general of descendants and this also presents a problem for thougha man has lived happily up to old age and has had a death worthy ofhis life many reverses may befall his descendants some of them maybe good and attain the life they deserve while with others the oppositemay be the case and clearly too the degrees of relationship betweenthem and their ancestors may vary indefinitely it would be odd thenif the dead man were to share in these changes and become at one timehappy at another wretched while it would also be odd if the fortunesof the descendants did not for some time have some effect on the happinessof their ancestors but we must return to our first difficulty for perhaps by a considerationof it our present problem might be solved now if we must see theend and only then call a man happy not as being happy but as havingbeen so before surely this is a paradox that when he is happy theattribute that belongs to him is not to be truly predicated of himbecause we do not wish to call living men happy on account of thechanges that may befall them and because we have assumed happinessto be something permanent and by no means easily changed while asingle man may suffer many turns of fortunes wheel for clearly ifwe were to keep pace with his fortunes we should often call the sameman happy and again wretched making the happy man out to be chameleonand insecurely based or is this keeping pace with his fortunes quitewrong success or failure in life does not depend on these but humanlife as we said needs these as mere additions while virtuous activitiesor their opposites are what constitute happiness or the reversethe question we have now discussed confirms our definition for nofunction of man has so much permanence as virtuous activities theseare thought to be more durable even than knowledge of the sciencesand of these themselves the most valuable are more durable becausethose who are happy spend their life most readily and most continuouslyin these for this seems to be the reason why we do not forget themthe attribute in question then will belong to the happy man andhe will be happy throughout his life for always or by preferenceto everything else he will be engaged in virtuous action and contemplationand he will bear the chances of life most nobly and altogether decorouslyif he is truly good and foursquare beyond reproach now many events happen by chance and events differing in importancesmall pieces of good fortune or of its opposite clearly do not weighdown the scales of life one way or the other but a multitude of greatevents if they turn out well will make life happier for not onlyare they themselves such as to add beauty to life but the way a mandeals with them may be noble and good while if they turn out illthey crush and maim happiness for they both bring pain with themand hinder many activities yet even in these nobility shines throughwhen a man bears with resignation many great misfortunes not throughinsensibility to pain but through nobility and greatness of soulif activities are as we said what gives life its character no happyman can become miserable for he will never do the acts that are hatefuland mean for the man who is truly good and wise we think bearsall the chances life becomingly and always makes the best of circumstancesas a good general makes the best military use of the army at his commandand a good shoemaker makes the best shoes out of the hides that aregiven him and so with all other craftsmen and if this is the casethe happy man can never become miserable though he will not reachblessedness if he meet with fortunes like those of priamnor again is he manycoloured and changeable for neither will hebe moved from his happy state easily or by any ordinary misadventuresbut only by many great ones nor if he has had many great misadventureswill he recover his happiness in a short time but if at all onlyin a long and complete one in which he has attained many splendidsuccesses when then should we not say that he is happy who is active in accordancewith complete virtue and is sufficiently equipped with external goodsnot for some chance period but throughout a complete life or mustwe add and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his lifecertainly the future is obscure to us while happiness we claimis an end and something in every way final if so we shall call happythose among living men in whom these conditions are and are to befulfilled but happy men so much for these questions  that the fortunes of descendants and of all a mans friends shouldnot affect his happiness at all seems a very unfriendly doctrineand one opposed to the opinions men hold but since the events thathappen are numerous and admit of all sorts of difference and somecome more near to us and others less so it seems a long nay aninfinite task to discuss each in detail a general outline will perhapssuffice if then as some of a mans own misadventures have a certainweight and influence on life while others are as it were lighterso too there are differences among the misadventures of our friendstaken as a whole and it makes a difference whether the various sufferingbefall the living or the dead much more even than whether lawlessand terrible deeds are presupposed in a tragedy or done on the stagethis difference also must be taken into account or rather perhapsthe fact that doubt is felt whether the dead share in any good orevil for it seems from these considerations that even if anythingwhether good or evil penetrates to them it must be something weakand negligible either in itself or for them or if not at leastit must be such in degree and kind as not to make happy those whoare not happy nor to take away their blessedness from those who arethe good or bad fortunes of friends then seem to have some effectson the dead but effects of such a kind and degree as neither to makethe happy unhappy nor to produce any other change of the kind these questions having been definitely answered let us consider whetherhappiness is among the things that are praised or rather among thethings that are prized for clearly it is not to be placed among potentialitieseverything that is praised seems to be praised because it is of acertain kind and is related somehow to something else for we praisethe just or brave man and in general both the good man and virtueitself because of the actions and functions involved and we praisethe strong man the good runner and so on because he is of a certainkind and is related in a certain way to something good and importantthis is clear also from the praises of the gods for it seems absurdthat the gods should be referred to our standard but this is donebecause praise involves a reference to something else but if ifpraise is for things such as we have described clearly what appliesto the best things is not praise but something greater and betteras is indeed obvious for what we do to the gods and the most godlikeof men is to call them blessed and happy and so too with good thingsno one praises happiness as he does justice but rather calls it blessedas being something more divine and better eudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocatingthe supremacy of pleasure he thought that the fact that though agood it is not praised indicated it to be better than the thingsthat are praised and that this is what god and the good are forby reference to these all other things are judged praise is appropriateto virtue for as a result of virtue men tend to do noble deeds butencomia are bestowed on acts whether of the body or of the soulbut perhaps nicety in these matters is more proper to those who havemade a study of encomia to us it is clear from what has been saidthat happiness is among the things that are prized and perfect itseems to be so also from the fact that it is a first principle forit is for the sake of this that we all do all that we do and thefirst principle and cause of goods is we claim something prizedand divine  since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfectvirtue we must consider the nature of virtue for perhaps we shallthus see better the nature of happiness the true student of politicstoo is thought to have studied virtue above all things for he wishesto make his fellow citizens good and obedient to the laws as an exampleof this we have the lawgivers of the cretans and the spartans andany others of the kind that there may have been and if this inquirybelongs to political science clearly the pursuit of it will be inaccordance with our original plan but clearly the virtue we muststudy is human virtue for the good we were seeking was human goodand the happiness human happiness by human virtue we mean not thatof the body but that of the soul and happiness also we call an activityof soul but if this is so clearly the student of politics must knowsomehow the facts about soul as the man who is to heal the eyes orthe body as a whole must know about the eyes or the body and allthe more since politics is more prized and better than medicine buteven among doctors the best educated spend much labour on acquiringknowledge of the body the student of politics then must study thesoul and must study it with these objects in view and do so justto the extent which is sufficient for the questions we are discussingfor further precision is perhaps something more laborious than ourpurposes require some things are said about it adequately enough even in the discussionsoutside our school and we must use these eg that one element inthe soul is irrational and one has a rational principle whether theseare separated as the parts of the body or of anything divisible areor are distinct by definition but by nature inseparable like convexand concave in the circumference of a circle does not affect thepresent question of the irrational element one division seems to be widely distributedand vegetative in its nature i mean that which causes nutrition andgrowth for it is this kind of power of the soul that one must assignto all nurslings and to embryos and this same power to fullgrowncreatures this is more reasonable than to assign some different powerto them now the excellence of this seems to be common to all speciesand not specifically human for this part or faculty seems to functionmost in sleep while goodness and badness are least manifest in sleepwhence comes the saying that the happy are not better off than thewretched for half their lives and this happens naturally enoughsince sleep is an inactivity of the soul in that respect in whichit is called good or bad unless perhaps to a small extent some ofthe movements actually penetrate to the soul and in this respectthe dreams of good men are better than those of ordinary people enoughof this subject however let us leave the nutritive faculty alonesince it has by its nature no share in human excellencethere seems to be also another irrational element in the soulonewhich in a sense however shares in a rational principle for wepraise the rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinentand the part of their soul that has such a principle since it urgesthem aright and towards the best objects but there is found in themalso another element naturally opposed to the rational principlewhich fights against and resists that principle for exactly as paralysedlimbs when we intend to move them to the right turn on the contraryto the left so is it with the soul the impulses of incontinent peoplemove in contrary directions but while in the body we see that whichmoves astray in the soul we do not no doubt however we must nonethe less suppose that in the soul too there is something contraryto the rational principle resisting and opposing it in what senseit is distinct from the other elements does not concern us now eventhis seems to have a share in a rational principle as we said atany rate in the continent man it obeys the rational principle andpresumably in the temperate and brave man it is still more obedientfor in him it speaks on all matters with the same voice as the rationalprinciple therefore the irrational element also appears to be twofold forthe vegetative element in no way shares in a rational principle butthe appetitive and in general the desiring element in a sense sharesin it in so far as it listens to and obeys it this is the sensein which we speak of taking account of ones father or ones friendsnot that in which we speak of accounting for a mathematical propertythat the irrational element is in some sense persuaded by a rationalprinciple is indicated also by the giving of advice and by all reproofand exhortation and if this element also must be said to have a rationalprinciple that which has a rational principle as well as that whichhas not will be twofold one subdivision having it in the strictsense and in itself and the other having a tendency to obey as onedoes ones father virtue too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with this differencefor we say that some of the virtues are intellectual and others moralphilosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom being intellectualliberality and temperance moral for in speaking about a mans characterwe do not say that he is wise or has understanding but that he isgoodtempered or temperate yet we praise the wise man also with respectto his state of mind and of states of mind we call those which meritpraise virtues book ii virtue then being of two kinds intellectual and moral intellectualvirtue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teachingfor which reason it requires experience and time while moral virtuecomes about as a result of habit whence also its name ethike isone that is formed by a slight variation from the word ethos habitfrom this it is also plain that none of the moral virtues arises inus by nature for nothing that exists by nature can form a habit contraryto its nature for instance the stone which by nature moves downwardscannot be habituated to move upwards not even if one tries to trainit by throwing it up ten thousand times nor can fire be habituatedto move downwards nor can anything else that by nature behaves inone way be trained to behave in another neither by nature thennor contrary to nature do the virtues arise in us rather we are adaptedby nature to receive them and are made perfect by habitagain of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquirethe potentiality and later exhibit the activity this is plain inthe case of the senses for it was not by often seeing or often hearingthat we got these senses but on the contrary we had them before weused them and did not come to have them by using them but the virtueswe get by first exercising them as also happens in the case of thearts as well for the things we have to learn before we can do themwe learn by doing them eg men become builders by building and lyreplayersby playing the lyre so too we become just by doing just acts temperateby doing temperate acts brave by doing brave acts this is confirmed by what happens in states for legislators makethe citizens good by forming habits in them and this is the wishof every legislator and those who do not effect it miss their markand it is in this that a good constitution differs from a bad oneagain it is from the same causes and by the same means that everyvirtue is both produced and destroyed and similarly every art forit is from playing the lyre that both good and bad lyreplayers areproduced and the corresponding statement is true of builders andof all the rest men will be good or bad builders as a result of buildingwell or badly for if this were not so there would have been no needof a teacher but all men would have been born good or bad at theircraft this then is the case with the virtues also by doing theacts that we do in our transactions with other men we become justor unjust and by doing the acts that we do in the presence of dangerand being habituated to feel fear or confidence we become brave orcowardly the same is true of appetites and feelings of anger somemen become temperate and goodtempered others selfindulgent andirascible by behaving in one way or the other in the appropriatecircumstances thus in one word states of character arise out oflike activities this is why the activities we exhibit must be ofa certain kind it is because the states of character correspond tothe differences between these it makes no small difference thenwhether we form habits of one kind or of another from our very youthit makes a very great difference or rather all the difference since then the present inquiry does not aim at theoretical knowledgelike the others for we are inquiring not in order to know what virtueis but in order to become good since otherwise our inquiry wouldhave been of no use we must examine the nature of actions namelyhow we ought to do them for these determine also the nature of thestates of character that are produced as we have said now thatwe must act according to the right rule is a common principle andmust be assumedit will be discussed later ie both what the rightrule is and how it is related to the other virtues but this mustbe agreed upon beforehand that the whole account of matters of conductmust be given in outline and not precisely as we said at the verybeginning that the accounts we demand must be in accordance with thesubjectmatter matters concerned with conduct and questions of whatis good for us have no fixity any more than matters of health thegeneral account being of this nature the account of particular casesis yet more lacking in exactness for they do not fall under any artor precept but the agents themselves must in each case consider whatis appropriate to the occasion as happens also in the art of medicineor of navigation but though our present account is of this nature we must give whathelp we can first then let us consider this that it is the natureof such things to be destroyed by defect and excess as we see inthe case of strength and of health for to gain light on things imperceptiblewe must use the evidence of sensible things both excessive and defectiveexercise destroys the strength and similarly drink or food whichis above or below a certain amount destroys the health while thatwhich is proportionate both produces and increases and preserves itso too is it then in the case of temperance and courage and theother virtues for the man who flies from and fears everything anddoes not stand his ground against anything becomes a coward and theman who fears nothing at all but goes to meet every danger becomesrash and similarly the man who indulges in every pleasure and abstainsfrom none becomes selfindulgent while the man who shuns every pleasureas boors do becomes in a way insensible temperance and couragethen are destroyed by excess and defect and preserved by the meanbut not only are the sources and causes of their origination and growththe same as those of their destruction but also the sphere of theiractualization will be the same for this is also true of the thingswhich are more evident to sense eg of strength it is producedby taking much food and undergoing much exertion and it is the strongman that will be most able to do these things so too is it with thevirtues by abstaining from pleasures we become temperate and itis when we have become so that we are most able to abstain from themand similarly too in the case of courage for by being habituatedto despise things that are terrible and to stand our ground againstthem we become brave and it is when we have become so that we shallbe most able to stand our ground against them  we must take as a sign of states of character the pleasure or painthat ensues on acts for the man who abstains from bodily pleasuresand delights in this very fact is temperate while the man who isannoyed at it is selfindulgent and he who stands his ground againstthings that are terrible and delights in this or at least is not painedis brave while the man who is pained is a coward for moral excellenceis concerned with pleasures and pains it is on account of the pleasurethat we do bad things and on account of the pain that we abstainfrom noble ones hence we ought to have been brought up in a particularway from our very youth as plato says so as both to delight in andto be pained by the things that we ought for this is the right educationagain if the virtues are concerned with actions and passions andevery passion and every action is accompanied by pleasure and painfor this reason also virtue will be concerned with pleasures and painsthis is indicated also by the fact that punishment is inflicted bythese means for it is a kind of cure and it is the nature of curesto be effected by contraries again as we said but lately every state of soul has a nature relativeto and concerned with the kind of things by which it tends to be madeworse or better but it is by reason of pleasures and pains that menbecome bad by pursuing and avoiding these either the pleasures andpains they ought not or when they ought not or as they ought notor by going wrong in one of the other similar ways that may be distinguishedhence men even define the virtues as certain states of impassivityand rest not well however because they speak absolutely and donot say as one ought and as one ought not and when one oughtor ought not and the other things that may be added we assumethen that this kind of excellence tends to do what is best with regardto pleasures and pains and vice does the contrary the following facts also may show us that virtue and vice are concernedwith these same things there being three objects of choice and threeof avoidance the noble the advantageous the pleasant and theircontraries the base the injurious the painful about all of thesethe good man tends to go right and the bad man to go wrong and especiallyabout pleasure for this is common to the animals and also it accompaniesall objects of choice for even the noble and the advantageous appearpleasant again it has grown up with us all from our infancy this is why itis difficult to rub off this passion engrained as it is in our lifeand we measure even our actions some of us more and others lessby the rule of pleasure and pain for this reason then our wholeinquiry must be about these for to feel delight and pain rightlyor wrongly has no small effect on our actions again it is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger to useheraclitus phrase but both art and virtue are always concernedwith what is harder for even the good is better when it is hardertherefore for this reason also the whole concern both of virtue andof political science is with pleasures and pains for the man whouses these well will be good he who uses them badly badthat virtue then is concerned with pleasures and pains and thatby the acts from which it arises it is both increased and if theyare done differently destroyed and that the acts from which it aroseare those in which it actualizes itself let this be taken as said the question might be asked what we mean by saying that we mustbecome just by doing just acts and temperate by doing temperate actsfor if men do just and temperate acts they are already just and temperateexactly as if they do what is in accordance with the laws of grammarand of music they are grammarians and musicians or is this not true even of the arts it is possible to do somethingthat is in accordance with the laws of grammar either by chance orat the suggestion of another a man will be a grammarian then onlywhen he has both done something grammatical and done it grammaticallyand this means doing it in accordance with the grammatical knowledgein himself again the case of the arts and that of the virtues are not similarfor the products of the arts have their goodness in themselves sothat it is enough that they should have a certain character but ifthe acts that are in accordance with the virtues have themselves acertain character it does not follow that they are done justly ortemperately the agent also must be in a certain condition when hedoes them in the first place he must have knowledge secondly hemust choose the acts and choose them for their own sakes and thirdlyhis action must proceed from a firm and unchangeable character theseare not reckoned in as conditions of the possession of the arts exceptthe bare knowledge but as a condition of the possession of the virtuesknowledge has little or no weight while the other conditions countnot for a little but for everything ie the very conditions whichresult from often doing just and temperate acts actions then are called just and temperate when they are such asthe just or the temperate man would do but it is not the man whodoes these that is just and temperate but the man who also does themas just and temperate men do them it is well said then that itis by doing just acts that the just man is produced and by doingtemperate acts the temperate man without doing these no one wouldhave even a prospect of becoming good but most people do not do these but take refuge in theory and thinkthey are being philosophers and will become good in this way behavingsomewhat like patients who listen attentively to their doctors butdo none of the things they are ordered to do as the latter will notbe made well in body by such a course of treatment the former willnot be made well in soul by such a course of philosophy next we must consider what virtue is since things that are foundin the soul are of three kinds passions faculties states of charactervirtue must be one of these by passions i mean appetite anger fearconfidence envy joy friendly feeling hatred longing emulationpity and in general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasureor pain by faculties the things in virtue of which we are said tobe capable of feeling these eg of becoming angry or being painedor feeling pity by states of character the things in virtue of whichwe stand well or badly with reference to the passions eg with referenceto anger we stand badly if we feel it violently or too weakly andwell if we feel it moderately and similarly with reference to theother passions now neither the virtues nor the vices are passions because we arenot called good or bad on the ground of our passions but are so calledon the ground of our virtues and our vices and because we are neitherpraised nor blamed for our passions for the man who feels fear oranger is not praised nor is the man who simply feels anger blamedbut the man who feels it in a certain way but for our virtues andour vices we are praised or blamed again we feel anger and fear without choice but the virtues aremodes of choice or involve choice further in respect of the passionswe are said to be moved but in respect of the virtues and the viceswe are said not to be moved but to be disposed in a particular wayfor these reasons also they are not faculties for we are neithercalled good nor bad nor praised nor blamed for the simple capacityof feeling the passions again we have the faculties by nature butwe are not made good or bad by nature we have spoken of this beforeif then the virtues are neither passions nor faculties all thatremains is that they should be states of character thus we have stated what virtue is in respect of its genus we must however not only describe virtue as a state of characterbut also say what sort of state it is we may remark then that everyvirtue or excellence both brings into good condition the thing ofwhich it is the excellence and makes the work of that thing be donewell eg the excellence of the eye makes both the eye and its workgood for it is by the excellence of the eye that we see well similarlythe excellence of the horse makes a horse both good in itself andgood at running and at carrying its rider and at awaiting the attackof the enemy therefore if this is true in every case the virtueof man also will be the state of character which makes a man goodand which makes him do his own work well how this is to happen we have stated already but it will be madeplain also by the following consideration of the specific nature ofvirtue in everything that is continuous and divisible it is possibleto take more less or an equal amount and that either in terms ofthe thing itself or relatively to us and the equal is an intermediatebetween excess and defect by the intermediate in the object i meanthat which is equidistant from each of the extremes which is oneand the same for all men by the intermediate relatively to us thatwhich is neither too much nor too little and this is not one northe same for all for instance if ten is many and two is few sixis the intermediate taken in terms of the object for it exceedsand is exceeded by an equal amount this is intermediate accordingto arithmetical proportion but the intermediate relatively to usis not to be taken so if ten pounds are too much for a particularperson to eat and two too little it does not follow that the trainerwill order six pounds for this also is perhaps too much for the personwho is to take it or too little too little for milo too much forthe beginner in athletic exercises the same is true of running andwrestling thus a master of any art avoids excess and defect butseeks the intermediate and chooses this the intermediate not in theobject but relatively to us if it is thus then that every art does its work well by lookingto the intermediate and judgling its works by this standard so thatwe often say of good works of art that it is not possible either totake away or to add anything implying that excess and defect destroythe goodness of works of art while the mean preserves it and goodartists as we say look to this in their work and if furthervirtue is more exact and better than any art as nature also is thenvirtue must have the quality of aiming at the intermediate i meanmoral virtue for it is this that is concerned with passions and actionsand in these there is excess defect and the intermediate for instanceboth fear and confidence and appetite and anger and pity and in generalpleasure and pain may be felt both too much and too little and inboth cases not well but to feel them at the right times with referenceto the right objects towards the right people with the right motiveand in the right way is what is both intermediate and best and thisis characteristic of virtue similarly with regard to actions alsothere is excess defect and the intermediate now virtue is concernedwith passions and actions in which excess is a form of failure andso is defect while the intermediate is praised and is a form of successand being praised and being successful are both characteristics ofvirtue therefore virtue is a kind of mean since as we have seenit aims at what is intermediate again it is possible to fail in many ways for evil belongs to theclass of the unlimited as the pythagoreans conjectured and goodto that of the limited while to succeed is possible only in oneway for which reason also one is easy and the other difficult tomiss the mark easy to hit it difficult for these reasons alsothen excess and defect are characteristic of vice and the mean ofvirtue for men are good in but one way but bad in many virtue then is a state of character concerned with choice lyingin a mean ie the mean relative to us this being determined bya rational principle and by that principle by which the man of practicalwisdom would determine it now it is a mean between two vices thatwhich depends on excess and that which depends on defect and againit is a mean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceedwhat is right in both passions and actions while virtue both findsand chooses that which is intermediate hence in respect of its substanceand the definition which states its essence virtue is a mean withregard to what is best and right an extreme but not every action nor every passion admits of a mean for somehave names that already imply badness eg spite shamelessnessenvy and in the case of actions adultery theft murder for allof these and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselvesbad and not the excesses or deficiencies of them it is not possiblethen ever to be right with regard to them one must always be wrongnor does goodness or badness with regard to such things depend oncommitting adultery with the right woman at the right time and inthe right way but simply to do any of them is to go wrong it wouldbe equally absurd then to expect that in unjust cowardly and voluptuousaction there should be a mean an excess and a deficiency for atthat rate there would be a mean of excess and of deficiency an excessof excess and a deficiency of deficiency but as there is no excessand deficiency of temperance and courage because what is intermediateis in a sense an extreme so too of the actions we have mentionedthere is no mean nor any excess and deficiency but however they aredone they are wrong for in general there is neither a mean of excessand deficiency nor excess and deficiency of a mean  we must however not only make this general statement but also applyit to the individual facts for among statements about conduct thosewhich are general apply more widely but those which are particularare more genuine since conduct has to do with individual cases andour statements must harmonize with the facts in these cases we maytake these cases from our table with regard to feelings of fear andconfidence courage is the mean of the people who exceed he who exceedsin fearlessness has no name many of the states have no name whilethe man who exceeds in confidence is rash and he who exceeds in fearand falls short in confidence is a coward with regard to pleasuresand pains not all of them and not so much with regard to the painsthe mean is temperance the excess selfindulgence persons deficientwith regard to the pleasures are not often found hence such personsalso have received no name but let us call them insensiblewith regard to giving and taking of money the mean is liberalitythe excess and the defect prodigality and meanness in these actionspeople exceed and fall short in contrary ways the prodigal exceedsin spending and falls short in taking while the mean man exceedsin taking and falls short in spending at present we are giving amere outline or summary and are satisfied with this later thesestates will be more exactly determined with regard to money thereare also other dispositions a mean magnificence for the magnificentman differs from the liberal man the former deals with large sumsthe latter with small ones an excess tastelessness and vulgarityand a deficiency niggardliness these differ from the states opposedto liberality and the mode of their difference will be stated laterwith regard to honour and dishonour the mean is proper pride theexcess is known as a sort of empty vanity and the deficiency isundue humility and as we said liberality was related to magnificencediffering from it by dealing with small sums so there is a statesimilarly related to proper pride being concerned with small honourswhile that is concerned with great for it is possible to desire honouras one ought and more than one ought and less and the man who exceedsin his desires is called ambitious the man who falls short unambitiouswhile the intermediate person has no name the dispositions also arenameless except that that of the ambitious man is called ambitionhence the people who are at the extremes lay claim to the middle placeand we ourselves sometimes call the intermediate person ambitiousand sometimes unambitious and sometimes praise the ambitious manand sometimes the unambitious the reason of our doing this will bestated in what follows but now let us speak of the remaining statesaccording to the method which has been indicated with regard to anger also there is an excess a deficiency and amean although they can scarcely be said to have names yet sincewe call the intermediate person goodtempered let us call the meangood temper of the persons at the extremes let the one who exceedsbe called irascible and his vice irascibility and the man who fallsshort an inirascible sort of person and the deficiency inirascibilitythere are also three other means which have a certain likeness toone another but differ from one another for they are all concernedwith intercourse in words and actions but differ in that one is concernedwith truth in this sphere the other two with pleasantness and ofthis one kind is exhibited in giving amusement the other in all thecircumstances of life we must therefore speak of these too thatwe may the better see that in all things the mean is praiseworthyand the extremes neither praiseworthy nor right but worthy of blamenow most of these states also have no names but we must try as inthe other cases to invent names ourselves so that we may be clearand easy to follow with regard to truth then the intermediate isa truthful sort of person and the mean may be called truthfulnesswhile the pretence which exaggerates is boastfulness and the personcharacterized by it a boaster and that which understates is mockmodesty and the person characterized by it mockmodest with regardto pleasantness in the giving of amusement the intermediate personis readywitted and the disposition ready wit the excess is buffooneryand the person characterized by it a buffoon while the man who fallsshort is a sort of boor and his state is boorishness with regardto the remaining kind of pleasantness that which is exhibited inlife in general the man who is pleasant in the right way is friendlyand the mean is friendliness while the man who exceeds is an obsequiousperson if he has no end in view a flatterer if he is aiming at hisown advantage and the man who falls short and is unpleasant in allcircumstances is a quarrelsome and surly sort of personthere are also means in the passions and concerned with the passionssince shame is not a virtue and yet praise is extended to the modestman for even in these matters one man is said to be intermediateand another to exceed as for instance the bashful man who is ashamedof everything while he who falls short or is not ashamed of anythingat all is shameless and the intermediate person is modest righteousindignation is a mean between envy and spite and these states areconcerned with the pain and pleasure that are felt at the fortunesof our neighbours the man who is characterized by righteous indignationis pained at undeserved good fortune the envious man going beyondhim is pained at all good fortune and the spiteful man falls sofar short of being pained that he even rejoices but these statesthere will be an opportunity of describing elsewhere with regardto justice since it has not one simple meaning we shall after describingthe other states distinguish its two kinds and say how each of themis a mean and similarly we shall treat also of the rational virtues there are three kinds of disposition then two of them vices involvingexcess and deficiency respectively and one a virtue viz the meanand all are in a sense opposed to all for the extreme states arecontrary both to the intermediate state and to each other and theintermediate to the extremes as the equal is greater relatively tothe less less relatively to the greater so the middle states areexcessive relatively to the deficiencies deficient relatively tothe excesses both in passions and in actions for the brave man appearsrash relatively to the coward and cowardly relatively to the rashman and similarly the temperate man appears selfindulgent relativelyto the insensible man insensible relatively to the selfindulgentand the liberal man prodigal relatively to the mean man mean relativelyto the prodigal hence also the people at the extremes push the intermediateman each over to the other and the brave man is called rash by thecoward cowardly by the rash man and correspondingly in the othercases these states being thus opposed to one another the greatest contrarietyis that of the extremes to each other rather than to the intermediatefor these are further from each other than from the intermediateas the great is further from the small and the small from the greatthan both are from the equal again to the intermediate some extremesshow a certain likeness as that of rashness to courage and that ofprodigality to liberality but the extremes show the greatest unlikenessto each other now contraries are defined as the things that are furthestfrom each other so that things that are further apart are more contraryto the mean in some cases the deficiency in some the excess is moreopposed eg it is not rashness which is an excess but cowardicewhich is a deficiency that is more opposed to courage and not insensibilitywhich is a deficiency but selfindulgence which is an excess thatis more opposed to temperance this happens from two reasons onebeing drawn from the thing itself for because one extreme is nearerand liker to the intermediate we oppose not this but rather its contraryto the intermediate eg since rashness is thought liker and nearerto courage and cowardice more unlike we oppose rather the latterto courage for things that are further from the intermediate arethought more contrary to it this then is one cause drawn fromthe thing itself another is drawn from ourselves for the thingsto which we ourselves more naturally tend seem more contrary to theintermediate for instance we ourselves tend more naturally to pleasuresand hence are more easily carried away towards selfindulgence thantowards propriety we describe as contrary to the mean then ratherthe directions in which we more often go to great lengths and thereforeselfindulgence which is an excess is the more contrary to temperance that moral virtue is a mean then and in what sense it is so andthat it is a mean between two vices the one involving excess theother deficiency and that it is such because its character is toaim at what is intermediate in passions and in actions has been sufficientlystated hence also it is no easy task to be good for in everythingit is no easy task to find the middle eg to find the middle ofa circle is not for every one but for him who knows so too anyone can get angry that is easy or give or spend money but to dothis to the right person to the right extent at the right timewith the right motive and in the right way that is not for everyone nor is it easy wherefore goodness is both rare and laudableand noble hence he who aims at the intermediate must first depart from whatis the more contrary to it as calypso advises hold the ship out beyond that surf and spray for of the extremes one is more erroneous one less so thereforesince to hit the mean is hard in the extreme we must as a secondbest as people say take the least of the evils and this will bedone best in the way we describe but we must consider the thingstowards which we ourselves also are easily carried away for someof us tend to one thing some to another and this will be recognizablefrom the pleasure and the pain we feel we must drag ourselves awayto the contrary extreme for we shall get into the intermediate stateby drawing well away from error as people do in straightening sticksthat are bent now in everything the pleasant or pleasure is most to be guarded againstfor we do not judge it impartially we ought then to feel towardspleasure as the elders of the people felt towards helen and in allcircumstances repeat their saying for if we dismiss pleasure thuswe are less likely to go astray it is by doing this then to sumthe matter up that we shall best be able to hit the meanbut this is no doubt difficult and especially in individual casesfor or is not easy to determine both how and with whom and on whatprovocation and how long one should be angry for we too sometimespraise those who fall short and call them goodtempered but sometimeswe praise those who get angry and call them manly the man howeverwho deviates little from goodness is not blamed whether he do soin the direction of the more or of the less but only the man whodeviates more widely for he does not fail to be noticed but up towhat point and to what extent a man must deviate before he becomesblameworthy it is not easy to determine by reasoning any more thananything else that is perceived by the senses such things dependon particular facts and the decision rests with perception so muchthen is plain that the intermediate state is in all things to bepraised but that we must incline sometimes towards the excess sometimestowards the deficiency for so shall we most easily hit the mean andwhat is right book iii since virtue is concerned with passions and actions and on voluntarypassions and actions praise and blame are bestowed on those thatare involuntary pardon and sometimes also pity to distinguish thevoluntary and the involuntary is presumably necessary for those whoare studying the nature of virtue and useful also for legislatorswith a view to the assigning both of honours and of punishments thosethings then are thoughtinvoluntary which take place under compulsionor owing to ignorance and that is compulsory of which the movingprinciple is outside being a principle in which nothing is contributedby the person who is acting or is feeling the passion eg if hewere to be carried somewhere by a wind or by men who had him in theirpower but with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater evilsor for some noble object eg if a tyrant were to order one to dosomething base having ones parents and children in his power andif one did the action they were to be saved but otherwise would beput to death it may be debated whether such actions are involuntaryor voluntary something of the sort happens also with regard to thethrowing of goods overboard in a storm for in the abstract no onethrows goods away voluntarily but on condition of its securing thesafety of himself and his crew any sensible man does so such actionsthen are mixed but are more like voluntary actions for they areworthy of choice at the time when they are done and the end of anaction is relative to the occasion both the terms then voluntaryand involuntary must be used with reference to the moment of actionnow the man acts voluntarily for the principle that moves the instrumentalparts of the body in such actions is in him and the things of whichthe moving principle is in a man himself are in his power to do ornot to do such actions therefore are voluntary but in the abstractperhaps involuntary for no one would choose any such act in itselffor such actions men are sometimes even praised when they enduresomething base or painful in return for great and noble objects gainedin the opposite case they are blamed since to endure the greatestindignities for no noble end or for a trifling end is the mark ofan inferior person on some actions praise indeed is not bestowedbut pardon is when one does what he ought not under pressure whichoverstrains human nature and which no one could withstand but someacts perhaps we cannot be forced to do but ought rather to facedeath after the most fearful sufferings for the things that forcedeuripides alcmaeon to slay his mother seem absurd it is difficultsometimes to determine what should be chosen at what cost and whatshould be endured in return for what gain and yet more difficultto abide by our decisions for as a rule what is expected is painfuland what we are forced to do is base whence praise and blame arebestowed on those who have been compelled or have not what sort of acts then should be called compulsory we answer thatwithout qualification actions are so when the cause is in the externalcircumstances and the agent contributes nothing but the things thatin themselves are involuntary but now and in return for these gainsare worthy of choice and whose moving principle is in the agentare in themselves involuntary but now and in return for these gainsvoluntary they are more like voluntary acts for actions are in theclass of particulars and the particular acts here are voluntarywhat sort of things are to be chosen and in return for what it isnot easy to state for there are many differences in the particularcases but if some one were to say that pleasant and noble objects have acompelling power forcing us from without all acts would be for himcompulsory for it is for these objects that all men do everythingthey do and those who act under compulsion and unwillingly act withpain but those who do acts for their pleasantness and nobility dothem with pleasure it is absurd to make external circumstances responsibleand not oneself as being easily caught by such attractions and tomake oneself responsible for noble acts but the pleasant objects responsiblefor base acts the compulsory then seems to be that whose movingprinciple is outside the person compelled contributing nothingeverything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary itis only what produces pain and repentance that is involuntary forthe man who has done something owing to ignorance and feels not theleast vexation at his action has not acted voluntarily since hedid not know what he was doing nor yet involuntarily since he isnot pained of people then who act by reason of ignorance he whorepents is thought an involuntary agent and the man who does notrepent may since he is different be called a not voluntary agentfor since he differs from the other it is better that he shouldhave a name of his own acting by reason of ignorance seems also to be different from actingin ignorance for the man who is drunk or in a rage is thought toact as a result not of ignorance but of one of the causes mentionedyet not knowingly but in ignorance now every wicked man is ignorant of what he ought to do and what heought to abstain from and it is by reason of error of this kind thatmen become unjust and in general bad but the term involuntary tendsto be used not if a man is ignorant of what is to his advantage forit is not mistaken purpose that causes involuntary action it leadsrather to wickedness nor ignorance of the universal for that menare blamed but ignorance of particulars ie of the circumstancesof the action and the objects with which it is concerned for it ison these that both pity and pardon depend since the person who isignorant of any of these acts involuntarily perhaps it is just as well therefore to determine their nature andnumber a man may be ignorant then of who he is what he is doingwhat or whom he is acting on and sometimes also what eg what instrumenthe is doing it with and to what end eg he may think his act willconduce to some ones safety and how he is doing it eg whethergently or violently now of all of these no one could be ignorantunless he were mad and evidently also he could not be ignorant ofthe agent for how could he not know himself but of what he is doinga man might be ignorant as for instance people say it slipped outof their mouths as they were speaking or they did not know it wasa secret as aeschylus said of the mysteries or a man might sayhe let it go off when he merely wanted to show its working as theman did with the catapult again one might think ones son was anenemy as merope did or that a pointed spear had a button on itor that a stone was pumicestone or one might give a man a draughtto save him and really kill him or one might want to touch a manas people do in sparring and really wound him the ignorance mayrelate then to any of these things ie of the circumstances ofthe action and the man who was ignorant of any of these is thoughtto have acted involuntarily and especially if he was ignorant onthe most important points and these are thought to be the circumstancesof the action and its end further the doing of an act that is calledinvoluntary in virtue of ignorance of this sort must be painful andinvolve repentance since that which is done under compulsion or by reason of ignoranceis involuntary the voluntary would seem to be that of which the movingprinciple is in the agent himself he being aware of the particularcircumstances of the action presumably acts done by reason of angeror appetite are not rightly called involuntary for in the first placeon that showing none of the other animals will act voluntarily norwill children and secondly is it meant that we do not do voluntarilyany of the acts that are due to appetite or anger or that we do thenoble acts voluntarily and the base acts involuntarily is not thisabsurd when one and the same thing is the cause but it would surelybe odd to describe as involuntary the things one ought to desireand we ought both to be angry at certain things and to have an appetitefor certain things eg for health and for learning also what isinvoluntary is thought to be painful but what is in accordance withappetite is thought to be pleasant again what is the differencein respect of involuntariness between errors committed upon calculationand those committed in anger both are to be avoided but the irrationalpassions are thought not less human than reason is and thereforealso the actions which proceed from anger or appetite are the mansactions it would be odd then to treat them as involuntary both the voluntary and the involuntary having been delimited we mustnext discuss choice for it is thought to be most closely bound upwith virtue and to discriminate characters better than actions dochoice then seems to be voluntary but not the same thing as thevoluntary the latter extends more widely for both children and thelower animals share in voluntary action but not in choice and actsdone on the spur of the moment we describe as voluntary but not aschosen those who say it is appetite or anger or wish or a kind of opiniondo not seem to be right for choice is not common to irrational creaturesas well but appetite and anger are again the incontinent man actswith appetite but not with choice while the continent man on thecontrary acts with choice but not with appetite again appetiteis contrary to choice but not appetite to appetite again appetiterelates to the pleasant and the painful choice neither to the painfulnor to the pleasant still less is it anger for acts due to anger are thought to be lessthan any others objects of choice but neither is it wish though it seems near to it for choice cannotrelate to impossibles and if any one said he chose them he wouldbe thought silly but there may be a wish even for impossibles egfor immortality and wish may relate to things that could in no waybe brought about by ones own efforts eg that a particular actoror athlete should win in a competition but no one chooses such thingsbut only the things that he thinks could be brought about by his ownefforts again wish relates rather to the end choice to the meansfor instance we wish to be healthy but we choose the acts whichwill make us healthy and we wish to be happy and say we do but wecannot well say we choose to be so for in general choice seemsto relate to the things that are in our own power for this reason too it cannot be opinion for opinion is thoughtto relate to all kinds of things no less to eternal things and impossiblethings than to things in our own power and it is distinguished byits falsity or truth not by its badness or goodness while choiceis distinguished rather by these now with opinion in general perhaps no one even says it is identicalbut it is not identical even with any kind of opinion for by choosingwhat is good or bad we are men of a certain character which we arenot by holding certain opinions and we choose to get or avoid somethinggood or bad but we have opinions about what a thing is or whom itis good for or how it is good for him we can hardly be said to opineto get or avoid anything and choice is praised for being relatedto the right object rather than for being rightly related to it opinionfor being truly related to its object and we choose what we bestknow to be good but we opine what we do not quite know and it isnot the same people that are thought to make the best choices andto have the best opinions but some are thought to have fairly goodopinions but by reason of vice to choose what they should not ifopinion precedes choice or accompanies it that makes no differencefor it is not this that we are considering but whether it is identicalwith some kind of opinion what then or what kind of thing is it since it is none of the thingswe have mentioned it seems to be voluntary but not all that is voluntaryto be an object of choice is it then what has been decided on byprevious deliberation at any rate choice involves a rational principleand thought even the name seems to suggest that it is what is chosenbefore other things  do we deliberate about everything and is everything a possible subjectof deliberation or is deliberation impossible about some thingswe ought presumably to call not what a fool or a madman would deliberateabout but what a sensible man would deliberate about a subject ofdeliberation now about eternal things no one deliberates eg aboutthe material universe or the incommensurability of the diagonal andthe side of a square but no more do we deliberate about the thingsthat involve movement but always happen in the same way whether ofnecessity or by nature or from any other cause eg the solsticesand the risings of the stars nor about things that happen now inone way now in another eg droughts and rains nor about chanceevents like the finding of treasure but we do not deliberate evenabout all human affairs for instance no spartan deliberates aboutthe best constitution for the scythians for none of these thingscan be brought about by our own efforts we deliberate about things that are in our power and can be doneand these are in fact what is left for nature necessity and chanceare thought to be causes and also reason and everything that dependson man now every class of men deliberates about the things that canbe done by their own efforts and in the case of exact and selfcontainedsciences there is no deliberation eg about the letters of the alphabetfor we have no doubt how they should be written but the thingsthat are brought about by our own efforts but not always in the sameway are the things about which we deliberate eg questions of medicaltreatment or of moneymaking and we do so more in the case of theart of navigation than in that of gymnastics inasmuch as it has beenless exactly worked out and again about other things in the sameratio and more also in the case of the arts than in that of the sciencesfor we have more doubt about the former deliberation is concernedwith things that happen in a certain way for the most part but inwhich the event is obscure and with things in which it is indeterminatewe call in others to aid us in deliberation on important questionsdistrusting ourselves as not being equal to deciding we deliberate not about ends but about means for a doctor does notdeliberate whether he shall heal nor an orator whether he shall persuadenor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order nor does anyone else deliberate about his end they assume the end and considerhow and by what means it is to be attained and if it seems to beproduced by several means they consider by which it is most easilyand best produced while if it is achieved by one only they considerhow it will be achieved by this and by what means this will be achievedtill they come to the first cause which in the order of discoveryis last for the person who deliberates seems to investigate and analysein the way described as though he were analysing a geometrical constructionnot all investigation appears to be deliberation for instance mathematicalinvestigations but all deliberation is investigation and what islast in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becomingand if we come on an impossibility we give up the search eg ifwe need money and this cannot be got but if a thing appears possiblewe try to do it by possible things i mean things that might bebrought about by our own efforts and these in a sense include thingsthat can be brought about by the efforts of our friends since themoving principle is in ourselves the subject of investigation issometimes the instruments sometimes the use of them and similarlyin the other cases sometimes the means sometimes the mode of usingit or the means of bringing it about it seems then as has beensaid that man is a moving principle of actions now deliberationis about the things to be done by the agent himself and actions arefor the sake of things other than themselves for the end cannot bea subject of deliberation but only the means nor indeed can theparticular facts be a subject of it as whether this is bread or hasbeen baked as it should for these are matters of perception if weare to be always deliberating we shall have to go on to infinitythe same thing is deliberated upon and is chosen except that theobject of choice is already determinate since it is that which hasbeen decided upon as a result of deliberation that is the object ofchoice for every one ceases to inquire how he is to act when he hasbrought the moving principle back to himself and to the ruling partof himself for this is what chooses this is plain also from theancient constitutions which homer represented for the kings announcedtheir choices to the people the object of choice being one of thethings in our own power which is desired after deliberation choicewill be deliberate desire of things in our own power for when wehave decided as a result of deliberation we desire in accordancewith our deliberation we may take it then that we have described choice in outline andstated the nature of its objects and the fact that it is concernedwith means  that wish is for the end has already been stated some think it isfor the good others for the apparent good now those who say thatthe good is the object of wish must admit in consequence that thatwhich the man who does not choose aright wishes for is not an objectof wish for if it is to be so it must also be good but it wasif it so happened bad while those who say the apparent good isthe object of wish must admit that there is no natural object of wishbut only what seems good to each man now different things appeargood to different people and if it so happens even contrary thingsif these consequences are unpleasing are we to say that absolutelyand in truth the good is the object of wish but for each person theapparent good that that which is in truth an object of wish is anobject of wish to the good man while any chance thing may be so thebad man as in the case of bodies also the things that are in truthwholesome are wholesome for bodies which are in good condition whilefor those that are diseased other things are wholesome or bitteror sweet or hot or heavy and so on since the good man judges eachclass of things rightly and in each the truth appears to him foreach state of character has its own ideas of the noble and the pleasantand perhaps the good man differs from others most by seeing the truthin each class of things being as it were the norm and measure ofthem in most things the error seems to be due to pleasure for itappears a good when it is not we therefore choose the pleasant asa good and avoid pain as an evil  the end then being what we wish for the means what we deliberateabout and choose actions concerning means must be according to choiceand voluntary now the exercise of the virtues is concerned with meanstherefore virtue also is in our own power and so too vice for whereit is in our power to act it is also in our power not to act andvice versa so that if to act where this is noble is in our powernot to act which will be base will also be in our power and ifnot to act where this is noble is in our power to act which willbe base will also be in our power now if it is in our power to donoble or base acts and likewise in our power not to do them andthis was what being good or bad meant then it is in our power tobe virtuous or vicious the saying that no one is voluntarily wicked nor involuntarily happyseems to be partly false and partly true for no one is involuntarilyhappy but wickedness is voluntary or else we shall have to disputewhat has just been said at any rate and deny that man is a movingprinciple or begetter of his actions as of children but if thesefacts are evident and we cannot refer actions to moving principlesother than those in ourselves the acts whose moving principles arein us must themselves also be in our power and voluntarywitness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their privatecapacity and by legislators themselves for these punish and takevengeance on those who do wicked acts unless they have acted undercompulsion or as a result of ignorance for which they are not themselvesresponsible while they honour those who do noble acts as thoughthey meant to encourage the latter and deter the former but no oneis encouraged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntaryit is assumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hotor in pain or hungry or the like since we shall experience thesefeelings none the less indeed we punish a man for his very ignoranceif he is thought responsible for the ignorance as when penaltiesare doubled in the case of drunkenness for the moving principle isin the man himself since he had the power of not getting drunk andhis getting drunk was the cause of his ignorance and we punish thosewho are ignorant of anything in the laws that they ought to know andthat is not difficult and so too in the case of anything else thatthey are thought to be ignorant of through carelessness we assumethat it is in their power not to be ignorant since they have thepower of taking care but perhaps a man is the kind of man not to take care still theyare themselves by their slack lives responsible for becoming men ofthat kind and men make themselves responsible for being unjust orselfindulgent in the one case by cheating and in the other by spendingtheir time in drinking bouts and the like for it is activities exercisedon particular objects that make the corresponding character thisis plain from the case of people training for any contest or actionthey practise the activity the whole time now not to know that itis from the exercise of activities on particular objects that statesof character are produced is the mark of a thoroughly senseless personagain it is irrational to suppose that a man who acts unjustly doesnot wish to be unjust or a man who acts selfindulgently to be selfindulgentbut if without being ignorant a man does the things which will makehim unjust he will be unjust voluntarily yet it does not followthat if he wishes he will cease to be unjust and will be just forneither does the man who is ill become well on those terms we maysuppose a case in which he is ill voluntarily through living incontinentlyand disobeying his doctors in that case it was then open to him notto be ill but not now when he has thrown away his chance just aswhen you have let a stone go it is too late to recover it but yetit was in your power to throw it since the moving principle was inyou so too to the unjust and to the selfindulgent man it was openat the beginning not to become men of this kind and so they are unjustand selfindulgent voluntarily but now that they have become so itis not possible for them not to be so but not only are the vices of the soul voluntary but those of thebody also for some men whom we accordingly blame while no one blamesthose who are ugly by nature we blame those who are so owing to wantof exercise and care so it is too with respect to weakness andinfirmity no one would reproach a man blind from birth or by diseaseor from a blow but rather pity him while every one would blame aman who was blind from drunkenness or some other form of selfindulgenceof vices of the body then those in our own power are blamed thosenot in our power are not and if this be so in the other cases alsothe vices that are blamed must be in our own power now some one may say that all men desire the apparent good but haveno control over the appearance but the end appears to each man ina form answering to his character we reply that if each man is somehowresponsible for his state of mind he will also be himself somehowresponsible for the appearance but if not no one is responsiblefor his own evildoing but every one does evil acts through ignoranceof the end thinking that by these he will get what is best and theaiming at the end is not selfchosen but one must be born with aneye as it were by which to judge rightly and choose what is trulygood and he is well endowed by nature who is well endowed with thisfor it is what is greatest and most noble and what we cannot getor learn from another but must have just such as it was when givenus at birth and to be well and nobly endowed with this will be perfectand true excellence of natural endowment if this is true then howwill virtue be more voluntary than vice to both men alike the goodand the bad the end appears and is fixed by nature or however itmay be and it is by referring everything else to this that men dowhatever they do whether then it is not by nature that the end appears to each mansuch as it does appear but something also depends on him or theend is natural but because the good man adopts the means voluntarilyvirtue is voluntary vice also will be none the less voluntary forin the case of the bad man there is equally present that which dependson himself in his actions even if not in his end if then as isasserted the virtues are voluntary for we are ourselves somehowpartly responsible for our states of character and it is by beingpersons of a certain kind that we assume the end to be so and sothe vices also will be voluntary for the same is true of themwith regard to the virtues in general we have stated their genus inoutline viz that they are means and that they are states of characterand that they tend and by their own nature to the doing of the actsby which they are produced and that they are in our power and voluntaryand act as the right rule prescribes but actions and states of characterare not voluntary in the same way for we are masters of our actionsfrom the beginning right to the end if we know the particular factsbut though we control the beginning of our states of character thegradual progress is not obvious any more than it is in illnessesbecause it was in our power however to act in this way or not inthis way therefore the states are voluntary let us take up the several virtues however and say which they areand what sort of things they are concerned with and how they are concernedwith them at the same time it will become plain how many they areand first let us speak of courage  that it is a mean with regard to feelings of fear and confidence hasalready been made evident and plainly the things we fear are terriblethings and these are to speak without qualification evils forwhich reason people even define fear as expectation of evil now wefear all evils eg disgrace poverty disease friendlessness deathbut the brave man is not thought to be concerned with all for tofear some things is even right and noble and it is base not to fearthem eg disgrace he who fears this is good and modest and hewho does not is shameless he is however by some people called braveby a transference of the word to a new meaning for he has in himsomething which is like the brave man since the brave man also isa fearless person poverty and disease we perhaps ought not to fearnor in general the things that do not proceed from vice and are notdue to a man himself but not even the man who is fearless of theseis brave yet we apply the word to him also in virtue of a similarityfor some who in the dangers of war are cowards are liberal and areconfident in face of the loss of money nor is a man a coward if hefears insult to his wife and children or envy or anything of the kindnor brave if he is confident when he is about to be flogged withwhat sort of terrible things then is the brave man concerned surelywith the greatest for no one is more likely than he to stand hisground against what is aweinspiring now death is the most terribleof all things for it is the end and nothing is thought to be anylonger either good or bad for the dead but the brave man would notseem to be concerned even with death in all circumstances eg atsea or in disease in what circumstances then surely in the noblestnow such deaths are those in battle for these take place in the greatestand noblest danger and these are correspondingly honoured in citystatesand at the courts of monarchs properly then he will be called bravewho is fearless in face of a noble death and of all emergencies thatinvolve death and the emergencies of war are in the highest degreeof this kind yet at sea also and in disease the brave man is fearlessbut not in the same way as the seaman for he has given up hope ofsafety and is disliking the thought of death in this shape whilethey are hopeful because of their experience at the same time weshow courage in situations where there is the opportunity of showingprowess or where death is noble but in these forms of death neitherof these conditions is fulfilled  what is terrible is not the same for all men but we say there arethings terrible even beyond human strength these then are terribleto every one at least to every sensible man but the terrible thingsthat are not beyond human strength differ in magnitude and degreeand so too do the things that inspire confidence now the brave manis as dauntless as man may be therefore while he will fear eventhe things that are not beyond human strength he will face them ashe ought and as the rule directs for honours sake for this is theend of virtue but it is possible to fear these more or less andagain to fear things that are not terrible as if they were of thefaults that are committed one consists in fearing what one shouldnot another in fearing as we should not another in fearing whenwe should not and so on and so too with respect to the things thatinspire confidence the man then who faces and who fears the rightthings and from the right motive in the right way and from the righttime and who feels confidence under the corresponding conditionsis brave for the brave man feels and acts according to the meritsof the case and in whatever way the rule directs now the end of everyactivity is conformity to the corresponding state of character thisis true therefore of the brave man as well as of others but courageis noble therefore the end also is noble for each thing is definedby its end therefore it is for a noble end that the brave man enduresand acts as courage directs of those who go to excess he who exceeds in fearlessness has no namewe have said previously that many states of character have no namesbut he would be a sort of madman or insensible person if he fearednothing neither earthquakes nor the waves as they say the celtsdo not while the man who exceeds in confidence about what reallyis terrible is rash the rash man however is also thought to beboastful and only a pretender to courage at all events as the braveman is with regard to what is terrible so the rash man wishes toappear and so he imitates him in situations where he can hence alsomost of them are a mixture of rashness and cowardice for while inthese situations they display confidence they do not hold their groundagainst what is really terrible the man who exceeds in fear is acoward for he fears both what he ought not and as he ought not andall the similar characterizations attach to him he is lacking alsoin confidence but he is more conspicuous for his excess of fear inpainful situations the coward then is a despairing sort of personfor he fears everything the brave man on the other hand has theopposite disposition for confidence is the mark of a hopeful dispositionthe coward the rash man and the brave man then are concerned withthe same objects but are differently disposed towards them for thefirst two exceed and fall short while the third holds the middlewhich is the right position and rash men are precipitate and wishfor dangers beforehand but draw back when they are in them whilebrave men are keen in the moment of action but quiet beforehandas we have said then courage is a mean with respect to things thatinspire confidence or fear in the circumstances that have been statedand it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so orbecause it is base not to do so but to die to escape from povertyor love or anything painful is not the mark of a brave man but ratherof a coward for it is softness to fly from what is troublesome andsuch a man endures death not because it is noble but to fly from evil courage then is something of this sort but the name is also appliedto five other kinds first comes the courage of the citizensoldier for this is most liketrue courage citizensoldiers seem to face dangers because of thepenalties imposed by the laws and the reproaches they would otherwiseincur and because of the honours they win by such action and thereforethose peoples seem to be bravest among whom cowards are held in dishonourand brave men in honour this is the kind of courage that homer depictseg in diomede and in hector first will polydamas be to heap reproach on me then andfor hector one day mid the trojans shall utter his vaultingharangue afraid was tydeides and fled from my face this kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlierbecause it is due to virtue for it is due to shame and to desireof a noble object ie honour and avoidance of disgrace which isignoble one might rank in the same class even those who are compelledby their rulers but they are inferior inasmuch as they do what theydo not from shame but from fear and to avoid not what is disgracefulbut what is painful for their masters compel them as hector doesbut if i shall spy any dastard that cowers far from the fightvainly will such an one hope to escape from the dogs and those who give them their posts and beat them if they retreatdo the same and so do those who draw them up with trenches or somethingof the sort behind them all of these apply compulsion but one oughtto be brave not under compulsion but because it is noble to be so experience with regard to particular facts is also thought tobe courage this is indeed the reason why socrates thought couragewas knowledge other people exhibit this quality in other dangersand professional soldiers exhibit it in the dangers of war for thereseem to be many empty alarms in war of which these have had the mostcomprehensive experience therefore they seem brave because the othersdo not know the nature of the facts again their experience makesthem most capable in attack and in defence since they can use theirarms and have the kind that are likely to be best both for attackand for defence therefore they fight like armed men against unarmedor like trained athletes against amateurs for in such contests tooit is not the bravest men that fight best but those who are strongestand have their bodies in the best condition professional soldiersturn cowards however when the danger puts too great a strain onthem and they are inferior in numbers and equipment for they arethe first to fly while citizenforces die at their posts as in facthappened at the temple of hermes for to the latter flight is disgracefuland death is preferable to safety on those terms while the formerfrom the very beginning faced the danger on the assumption that theywere stronger and when they know the facts they fly fearing deathmore than disgrace but the brave man is not that sort of person passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage those who act frompassion like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded themare thought to be brave because brave men also are passionate forpassion above all things is eager to rush on danger and hence homersput strength into his passion and aroused their spirit and passionand hard he breathed panting and his blood boiled for all suchexpressions seem to indicate the stirring and onset of passion nowbrave men act for honours sake but passion aids them while wildbeasts act under the influence of pain for they attack because theyhave been wounded or because they are afraid since if they are ina forest they do not come near one thus they are not brave becausedriven by pain and passion they rush on danger without foreseeingany of the perils since at that rate even asses would be brave whenthey are hungry for blows will not drive them from their food andlust also makes adulterers do many daring things those creaturesare not brave then which are driven on to danger by pain or passionthe courage that is due to passion seems to be the most naturaland to be courage if choice and motive be added men then as well as beasts suffer pain when they are angry andare pleased when they exact their revenge those who fight for thesereasons however are pugnacious but not brave for they do not actfor honours sake nor as the rule directs but from strength of feelingthey have however something akin to courage  nor are sanguine people brave for they are confident in dangeronly because they have conquered often and against many foes yetthey closely resemble brave men because both are confident but bravemen are confident for the reasons stated earlier while these areso because they think they are the strongest and can suffer nothingdrunken men also behave in this way they become sanguine whentheir adventures do not succeed however they run away but it wasthe mark of a brave man to face things that are and seem terriblefor a man because it is noble to do so and disgraceful not to doso hence also it is thought the mark of a braver man to be fearlessand undisturbed in sudden alarms than to be so in those that are foreseenfor it must have proceeded more from a state of character becauseless from preparation acts that are foreseen may be chosen by calculationand rule but sudden actions must be in accordance with ones stateof character  people who are ignorant of the danger also appear brave and theyare not far removed from those of a sanguine temper but are inferiorinasmuch as they have no selfreliance while these have hence alsothe sanguine hold their ground for a time but those who have beendeceived about the facts fly if they know or suspect that these aredifferent from what they supposed as happened to the argives whenthey fell in with the spartans and took them for sicyonianswe have then described the character both of brave men and of thosewho are thought to be brave  though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of fearit is not concerned with both alike but more with the things thatinspire fear for he who is undisturbed in face of these and bearshimself as he should towards these is more truly brave than the manwho does so towards the things that inspire confidence it is forfacing what is painful then as has been said that men are calledbrave hence also courage involves pain and is justly praised forit is harder to face what is painful than to abstain from what ispleasant yet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasantbut to be concealed by the attending circumstances as happens alsoin athletic contests for the end at which boxers aim is pleasantthe crown and the honours but the blows they take are distressingto flesh and blood and painful and so is their whole exertion andbecause the blows and the exertions are many the end which is butsmall appears to have nothing pleasant in it and so if the caseof courage is similar death and wounds will be painful to the braveman and against his will but he will face them because it is nobleto do so or because it is base not to do so and the more he is possessedof virtue in its entirety and the happier he is the more he willbe pained at the thought of death for life is best worth living forsuch a man and he is knowingly losing the greatest goods and thisis painful but he is none the less brave and perhaps all the moreso because he chooses noble deeds of war at that cost it is notthe case then with all the virtues that the exercise of them ispleasant except in so far as it reaches its end but it is quitepossible that the best soldiers may be not men of this sort but thosewho are less brave but have no other good for these are ready toface danger and they sell their life for trifling gainsso much then for courage it is not difficult to grasp its naturein outline at any rate from what has been said  after courage let us speak of temperance for these seem to be thevirtues of the irrational parts we have said that temperance is amean with regard to pleasures for it is less and not in the sameway concerned with pains selfindulgence also is manifested inthe same sphere now therefore let us determine with what sort ofpleasures they are concerned we may assume the distinction betweenbodily pleasures and those of the soul such as love of honour andlove of learning for the lover of each of these delights in thatof which he is a lover the body being in no way affected but ratherthe mind but men who are concerned with such pleasures are calledneither temperate nor selfindulgent nor again are those who areconcerned with the other pleasures that are not bodily for thosewho are fond of hearing and telling stories and who spend their dayson anything that turns up are called gossips but not selfindulgentnor are those who are pained at the loss of money or of friendstemperance must be concerned with bodily pleasures but not all evenof these for those who delight in objects of vision such as coloursand shapes and painting are called neither temperate nor selfindulgentyet it would seem possible to delight even in these either as oneshould or to excess or to a deficient degree and so too is it with objects of hearing no one calls those who delightextravagantly in music or acting selfindulgent nor those who doso as they ought temperate nor do we apply these names to those who delight in odour unlessit be incidentally we do not call those selfindulgent who delightin the odour of apples or roses or incense but rather those who delightin the odour of unguents or of dainty dishes for selfindulgent peopledelight in these because these remind them of the objects of theirappetite and one may see even other people when they are hungrydelighting in the smell of food but to delight in this kind of thingis the mark of the selfindulgent man for these are objects of appetiteto him nor is there in animals other than man any pleasure connected withthese senses except incidentally for dogs do not delight in thescent of hares but in the eating of them but the scent told themthe hares were there nor does the lion delight in the lowing of theox but in eating it but he perceived by the lowing that it was nearand therefore appears to delight in the lowing and similarly he doesnot delight because he sees a stag or a wild goat but because heis going to make a meal of it temperance and selfindulgence howeverare concerned with the kind of pleasures that the other animals sharein which therefore appear slavish and brutish these are touch andtaste but even of taste they appear to make little or no use forthe business of taste is the discriminating of flavours which isdone by winetasters and people who season dishes but they hardlytake pleasure in making these discriminations or at least selfindulgentpeople do not but in the actual enjoyment which in all cases comesthrough touch both in the case of food and in that of drink and inthat of sexual intercourse this is why a certain gourmand prayedthat his throat might become longer than a cranes implying thatit was the contact that he took pleasure in thus the sense with whichselfindulgence is connected is the most widely shared of the sensesand selfindulgence would seem to be justly a matter of reproachbecause it attaches to us not as men but as animals to delight insuch things then and to love them above all others is brutishfor even of the pleasures of touch the most liberal have been eliminatedeg those produced in the gymnasium by rubbing and by the consequentheat for the contact characteristic of the selfindulgent man doesnot affect the whole body but only certain parts  of the appetites some seem to be common others to be peculiar toindividuals and acquired eg the appetite for food is natural sinceevery one who is without it craves for food or drink and sometimesfor both and for love also as homer says if he is young and lustybut not every one craves for this or that kind of nourishment or lovenor for the same things hence such craving appears to be our veryown yet it has of course something natural about it for differentthings are pleasant to different kinds of people and some thingsare more pleasant to every one than chance objects now in the naturalappetites few go wrong and only in one direction that of excessfor to eat or drink whatever offers itself till one is surfeited isto exceed the natural amount since natural appetite is the replenishmentof ones deficiency hence these people are called bellygods thisimplying that they fill their belly beyond what is right it is peopleof entirely slavish character that become like this but with regardto the pleasures peculiar to individuals many people go wrong andin many ways for while the people who are fond of so and so areso called because they delight either in the wrong things or morethan most people do or in the wrong way the selfindulgent exceedin all three ways they both delight in some things that they oughtnot to delight in since they are hateful and if one ought to delightin some of the things they delight in they do so more than one oughtand than most men do plainly then excess with regard to pleasures is selfindulgenceand is culpable with regard to pains one is not as in the case ofcourage called temperate for facing them or selfindulgent for notdoing so but the selfindulgent man is so called because he is painedmore than he ought at not getting pleasant things even his pain beingcaused by pleasure and the temperate man is so called because heis not pained at the absence of what is pleasant and at his abstinencefrom it the selfindulgent man then craves for all pleasant things or thosethat are most pleasant and is led by his appetite to choose theseat the cost of everything else hence he is pained both when he failsto get them and when he is merely craving for them for appetite involvespain but it seems absurd to be pained for the sake of pleasurepeople who fall short with regard to pleasures and delight in themless than they should are hardly found for such insensibility isnot human even the other animals distinguish different kinds of foodand enjoy some and not others and if there is any one who finds nothingpleasant and nothing more attractive than anything else he must besomething quite different from a man this sort of person has notreceived a name because he hardly occurs the temperate man occupiesa middle position with regard to these objects for he neither enjoysthe things that the selfindulgent man enjoys mostbut rather dislikesthemnor in general the things that he should not nor anything ofthis sort to excess nor does he feel pain or craving when they areabsent or does so only to a moderate degree and not more than heshould nor when he should not and so on but the things that beingpleasant make for health or for good condition he will desire moderatelyand as he should and also other pleasant things if they are not hindrancesto these ends or contrary to what is noble or beyond his meansfor he who neglects these conditions loves such pleasures more thanthey are worth but the temperate man is not that sort of personbut the sort of person that the right rule prescribes  selfindulgence is more like a voluntary state than cowardice forthe former is actuated by pleasure the latter by pain of which theone is to be chosen and the other to be avoided and pain upsets anddestroys the nature of the person who feels it while pleasure doesnothing of the sort therefore selfindulgence is more voluntaryhence also it is more a matter of reproach for it is easier to becomeaccustomed to its objects since there are many things of this sortin life and the process of habituation to them is free from dangerwhile with terrible objects the reverse is the case but cowardicewould seem to be voluntary in a different degree from its particularmanifestations for it is itself painless but in these we are upsetby pain so that we even throw down our arms and disgrace ourselvesin other ways hence our acts are even thought to be done under compulsionfor the selfindulgent man on the other hand the particular actsare voluntary for he does them with craving and desire but thewhole state is less so for no one craves to be selfindulgentthe name selfindulgence is applied also to childish faults for theybear a certain resemblance to what we have been considering whichis called after which makes no difference to our present purposeplainly however the later is called after the earlier the transferenceof the name seems not a bad one for that which desires what is baseand which develops quickly ought to be kept in a chastened conditionand these characteristics belong above all to appetite and to thechild since children in fact live at the beck and call of appetiteand it is in them that the desire for what is pleasant is strongestif then it is not going to be obedient and subject to the rulingprinciple it will go to great lengths for in an irrational beingthe desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it tries every sourceof gratification and the exercise of appetite increases its innateforce and if appetites are strong and violent they even expel thepower of calculation hence they should be moderate and few and shouldin no way oppose the rational principleand this is what we call anobedient and chastened stateand as the child should live accordingto the direction of his tutor so the appetitive element should liveaccording to rational principle hence the appetitive element in atemperate man should harmonize with the rational principle for thenoble is the mark at which both aim and the temperate man cravesfor the things be ought as he ought as when he ought and when heought and this is what rational principle directs here we conclude our account of temperance book iv let us speak next of liberality it seems to be the mean with regardto wealth for the liberal man is praised not in respect of militarymatters nor of those in respect of which the temrate man is praisednor of judicial decisions but with regard to the giving and takingof wealth and especially in respect of giving now by wealth wemean all the things whose value is measured by money further prodigalityand meanness are excesses and defects with regard to wealth and meannesswe always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealthbut we sometimes apply the word prodigality in a complex sensefor we call those men prodigals who are incontinent and spend moneyon selfindulgence hence also they are thought the poorest charactersfor they combine more vices than one therefore the application ofthe word to them is not its proper use for a prodigal means a manwho has a single evil quality that of wasting his substance sincea prodigal is one who is being ruined by his own fault and the wastingof substance is thought to be a sort of ruining of oneself life beingheld to depend on possession of substance this then is the sense in which we take the word prodigalitynow the things that have a use may be used either well or badly andriches is a useful thing and everything is used best by the man whohas the virtue concerned with it riches therefore will be usedbest by the man who has the virtue concerned with wealth and thisis the liberal man now spending and giving seem to be the using ofwealth taking and keeping rather the possession of it hence it ismore the mark of the liberal man to give to the right people thanto take from the right sources and not to take from the wrong forit is more characteristic of virtue to do good than to have good doneto one and more characteristic to do what is noble than not to dowhat is base and it is not hard to see that giving implies doinggood and doing what is noble and taking implies having good doneto one or not acting basely and gratitude is felt towards him whogives not towards him who does not take and praise also is bestowedmore on him it is easier also not to take than to give for menare apter to give away their own too little than to take what is anothersgivers too are called liberal but those who do not take are notpraised for liberality but rather for justice while those who takeare hardly praised at all and the liberal are almost the most lovedof all virtuous characters since they are useful and this dependson their giving now virtuous actions are noble and done for the sake of the nobletherefore the liberal man like other virtuous men will give forthe sake of the noble and rightly for he will give to the rightpeople the right amounts and at the right time with all the otherqualifications that accompany right giving and that too with pleasureor without pain for that which is virtuous is pleasant or free frompainleast of all will it be painful but he who gives to the wrongpeople or not for the sake of the noble but for some other causewill be called not liberal but by some other name nor is he liberalwho gives with pain for he would prefer the wealth to the noble actand this is not characteristic of a liberal man but no more willthe liberal man take from wrong sources for such taking is not characteristicof the man who sets no store by wealth nor will he be a ready askerfor it is not characteristic of a man who confers benefits to acceptthem lightly but he will take from the right sources eg from hisown possessions not as something noble but as a necessity that hemay have something to give nor will he neglect his own propertysince he wishes by means of this to help others and he will refrainfrom giving to anybody and everybody that he may have something togive to the right people at the right time and where it is nobleto do so it is highly characteristic of a liberal man also to goto excess in giving so that he leaves too little for himself forit is the nature of a liberal man not to look to himself the termliberality is used relatively to a mans substance for liberalityresides not in the multitude of the gifts but in the state of characterof the giver and this is relative to the givers substance thereis therefore nothing to prevent the man who gives less from beingthe more liberal man if he has less to give those are thought tobe more liberal who have not made their wealth but inherited it forin the first place they have no experience of want and secondly allmen are fonder of their own productions as are parents and poetsit is not easy for the liberal man to be rich since he is not apteither at taking or at keeping but at giving away and does not valuewealth for its own sake but as a means to giving hence comes thecharge that is brought against fortune that those who deserve richesmost get it least but it is not unreasonable that it should turnout so for he cannot have wealth any more than anything else ifhe does not take pains to have it yet he will not give to the wrongpeople nor at the wrong time and so on for he would no longer beacting in accordance with liberality and if he spent on these objectshe would have nothing to spend on the right objects for as has beensaid he is liberal who spends according to his substance and on theright objects and he who exceeds is prodigal hence we do not calldespots prodigal for it is thought not easy for them to give andspend beyond the amount of their possessions liberality then beinga mean with regard to giving and taking of wealth the liberal manwill both give and spend the right amounts and on the right objectsalike in small things and in great and that with pleasure he willalso take the right amounts and from the right sources for the virtuebeing a mean with regard to both he will do both as he ought sincethis sort of taking accompanies proper giving and that which is notof this sort is contrary to it and accordingly the giving and takingthat accompany each other are present together in the same man whilethe contrary kinds evidently are not but if he happens to spend ina manner contrary to what is right and noble he will be pained butmoderately and as he ought for it is the mark of virtue both to bepleased and to be pained at the right objects and in the right wayfurther the liberal man is easy to deal with in money matters forhe can be got the better of since he sets no store by money andis more annoyed if he has not spent something that he ought than painedif he has spent something that he ought not and does not agree withthe saying of simonides the prodigal errs in these respects also for he is neither pleasednor pained at the right things or in the right way this will be moreevident as we go on we have said that prodigality and meanness areexcesses and deficiencies and in two things in giving and in takingfor we include spending under giving now prodigality exceeds in givingand not taking while meanness falls short in giving and exceedsin taking except in small things the characteristics of prodigality are not often combined for itis not easy to give to all if you take from none private personssoon exhaust their substance with giving and it is to these thatthe name of prodigals is applied though a man of this sort wouldseem to be in no small degree better than a mean man for he is easilycured both by age and by poverty and thus he may move towards themiddle state for he has the characteristics of the liberal man sincehe both gives and refrains from taking though he does neither ofthese in the right manner or well therefore if he were brought todo so by habituation or in some other way he would be liberal forhe will then give to the right people and will not take from thewrong sources this is why he is thought to have not a bad characterit is not the mark of a wicked or ignoble man to go to excess in givingand not taking but only of a foolish one the man who is prodigalin this way is thought much better than the mean man both for theaforesaid reasons and because he benefits many while the other benefitsno one not even himself but most prodigal people as has been said also take from the wrongsources and are in this respect mean they become apt to take becausethey wish to spend and cannot do this easily for their possessionssoon run short thus they are forced to provide means from some othersource at the same time because they care nothing for honour theytake recklessly and from any source for they have an appetite forgiving and they do not mind how or from what source hence also theirgiving is not liberal for it is not noble nor does it aim at nobilitynor is it done in the right way sometimes they make rich those whoshould be poor and will give nothing to people of respectable characterand much to flatterers or those who provide them with some other pleasurehence also most of them are selfindulgent for they spend lightlyand waste money on their indulgences and incline towards pleasuresbecause they do not live with a view to what is noble the prodigal man then turns into what we have described if he isleft untutored but if he is treated with care he will arrive at theintermediate and right state but meanness is both incurable forold age and every disability is thought to make men mean and moreinnate in men than prodigality for most men are fonder of gettingmoney than of giving it also extends widely and is multiform sincethere seem to be many kinds of meanness for it consists in two things deficiency in giving and excess intaking and is not found complete in all men but is sometimes dividedsome men go to excess in taking others fall short in giving thosewho are called by such names as miserly close stingy allfall short in giving but do not covet the possessions of others norwish to get them in some this is due to a sort of honesty and avoidanceof what is disgraceful for some seem or at least profess to hoardtheir money for this reason that they may not some day be forcedto do something disgraceful to this class belong the cheeseparerand every one of the sort he is so called from his excess of unwillingnessto give anything while others again keep their hands off the propertyof others from fear on the ground that it is not easy if one takesthe property of others oneself to avoid having ones own taken bythem they are therefore content neither to take nor to giveothers again exceed in respect of taking by taking anything and fromany source eg those who ply sordid trades pimps and all such peopleand those who lend small sums and at high rates for all of thesetake more than they ought and from wrong sources what is common tothem is evidently sordid love of gain they all put up with a badname for the sake of gain and little gain at that for those whomake great gains but from wrong sources and not the right gainseg despots when they sack cities and spoil temples we do not callmean but rather wicked impious and unjust but the gamester andthe footpad and the highwayman belong to the class of the meansince they have a sordid love of gain for it is for gain that bothof them ply their craft and endure the disgrace of it and the onefaces the greatest dangers for the sake of the booty while the othermakes gain from his friends to whom he ought to be giving boththen since they are willing to make gain from wrong sources aresordid lovers of gain therefore all such forms of taking are meanand it is natural that meanness is described as the contrary of liberalityfor not only is it a greater evil than prodigality but men err moreoften in this direction than in the way of prodigality as we havedescribed it so much then for liberality and the opposed vices  it would seem proper to discuss magnificence next for this also seemsto be a virtue concerned with wealth but it does not like liberalityextend to all the actions that are concerned with wealth but onlyto those that involve expenditure and in these it surpasses liberalityin scale for as the name itself suggests it is a fitting expenditureinvolving largeness of scale but the scale is relative for the expenseof equipping a trireme is not the same as that of heading a sacredembassy it is what is fitting then in relation to the agent andto the circumstances and the object the man who in small or middlingthings spends according to the merits of the case is not called magnificenteg the man who can say many a gift i gave the wanderer butonly the man who does so in great things for the magnificent manis liberal but the liberal man is not necessarily magnificent thedeficiency of this state of character is called niggardliness theexcess vulgarity lack of taste and the like which do not go toexcess in the amount spent on right objects but by showy expenditurein the wrong circumstances and the wrong manner we shall speak ofthese vices later the magnificent man is like an artist for he can see what is fittingand spend large sums tastefully for as we said at the begininga state of character is determined by its activities and by its objectsnow the expenses of the magnificent man are large and fitting suchtherefore are also his results for thus there will be a great expenditureand one that is fitting to its result therefore the result shouldbe worthy of the expense and the expense should be worthy of theresult or should even exceed it and the magnificent man will spendsuch sums for honours sake for this is common to the virtues andfurther he will do so gladly and lavishly for nice calculation isa niggardly thing and he will consider how the result can be mademost beautiful and most becoming rather than for how much it can beproduced and how it can be produced most cheaply it is necessarythen that the magnificent man be also liberal for the liberal manalso will spend what he ought and as he ought and it is in thesematters that the greatness implied in the name of the magnificentmanhis bigness as it wereis manifested since liberality is concernedwith these matters and at an equal expense he will produce a moremagnificent work of art for a possession and a work of art have notthe same excellence the most valuable possession is that which isworth most eg gold but the most valuable work of art is that whichis great and beautiful for the contemplation of such a work inspiresadmiration and so does magnificence and a work has an excellencevizmagnificencewhich involves magnitude magnificence is an attributeof expenditures of the kind which we call honourable eg those connectedwith the godsvotive offerings buildings and sacrificesand similarlywith any form of religious worship and all those that are properobjects of publicspirited ambition as when people think they oughtto equip a chorus or a trireme or entertain the city in a brilliantway but in all cases as has been said we have regard to the agentas well and ask who he is and what means he has for the expenditureshould be worthy of his means and suit not only the result but alsothe producer hence a poor man cannot be magnificent since he hasnot the means with which to spend large sums fittingly and he whotries is a fool since he spends beyond what can be expected of himand what is proper but it is right expenditure that is virtuousbut great expenditure is becoming to those who have suitable meansto start with acquired by their own efforts or from ancestors orconnexions and to people of high birth or reputation and so onfor all these things bring with them greatness and prestige primarilythen the magnificent man is of this sort and magnificence is shownin expenditures of this sort as has been said for these are thegreatest and most honourable of private occasions of expenditurethe most suitable are those that take place once for all eg a weddingor anything of the kind or anything that interests the whole cityor the people of position in it and also the receiving of foreignguests and the sending of them on their way and gifts and countergiftsfor the magnificent man spends not on himself but on public objectsand gifts bear some resemblance to votive offerings a magnificentman will also furnish his house suitably to his wealth for even ahouse is a sort of public ornament and will spend by preferenceon those works that are lasting for these are the most beautifuland on every class of things he will spend what is becoming for thesame things are not suitable for gods and for men nor in a templeand in a tomb and since each expenditure may be great of its kindand what is most magnificent absolutely is great expenditure on agreat object but what is magnificent here is what is great in thesecircumstances and greatness in the work differs from greatness inthe expense for the most beautiful ball or bottle is magnificentas a gift to a child but the price of it is small and meanthereforeit is characteristic of the magnificent man whatever kind of resulthe is producing to produce it magnificently for such a result isnot easily surpassed and to make it worthy of the expendituresuch then is the magnificent man the man who goes to excess andis vulgar exceeds as has been said by spending beyond what is rightfor on small objects of expenditure he spends much and displays atasteless showiness eg he gives a club dinner on the scale of awedding banquet and when he provides the chorus for a comedy he bringsthem on to the stage in purple as they do at megara and all suchthings he will do not for honours sake but to show off his wealthand because he thinks he is admired for these things and where heought to spend much he spends little and where little much the niggardlyman on the other hand will fall short in everything and after spendingthe greatest sums will spoil the beauty of the result for a trifleand whatever he is doing he will hesitate and consider how he mayspend least and lament even that and think he is doing everythingon a bigger scale than he ought these states of character then are vices yet they do not bringdisgrace because they are neither harmful to ones neighbour nor veryunseemly  pride seems even from its name to be concerned with great thingswhat sort of great things is the first question we must try to answerit makes no difference whether we consider the state of characteror the man characterized by it now the man is thought to be proudwho thinks himself worthy of great things being worthy of them forhe who does so beyond his deserts is a fool but no virtuous man isfoolish or silly the proud man then is the man we have describedfor he who is worthy of little and thinks himself worthy of littleis temperate but not proud for pride implies greatness as beautyimplies a goodsized body and little people may be neat and wellproportionedbut cannot be beautiful on the other hand he who thinks himselfworthy of great things being unworthy of them is vain though notevery one who thinks himself worthy of more than he really is worthyof in vain the man who thinks himself worthy of worthy of less thanhe is really worthy of is unduly humble whether his deserts be greator moderate or his deserts be small but his claims yet smaller andthe man whose deserts are great would seem most unduly humble forwhat would he have done if they had been less the proud man thenis an extreme in respect of the greatness of his claims but a meanin respect of the rightness of them for he claims what is accordancewith his merits while the others go to excess or fall shortif then he deserves and claims great things and above all the greatthings he will be concerned with one thing in particular desertis relative to external goods and the greatest of these we shouldsay is that which we render to the gods and which people of positionmost aim at and which is the prize appointed for the noblest deedsand this is honour that is surely the greatest of external goodshonours and dishonours therefore are the objects with respect towhich the proud man is as he should be and even apart from argumentit is with honour that proud men appear to be concerned for it ishonour that they chiefly claim but in accordance with their desertsthe unduly humble man falls short both in comparison with his ownmerits and in comparison with the proud mans claims the vain mangoes to excess in comparison with his own merits but does not exceedthe proud mans claims now the proud man since he deserves most must be good in the highestdegree for the better man always deserves more and the best manmost therefore the truly proud man must be good and greatness inevery virtue would seem to be characteristic of a proud man and itwould be most unbecoming for a proud man to fly from danger swinginghis arms by his sides or to wrong another for to what end shouldhe do disgraceful acts he to whom nothing is great if we considerhim point by point we shall see the utter absurdity of a proud manwho is not good nor again would he be worthy of honour if he werebad for honour is the prize of virtue and it is to the good thatit is rendered pride then seems to be a sort of crown of the virtuesfor it makes them greater and it is not found without them thereforeit is hard to be truly proud for it is impossible without nobilityand goodness of character it is chiefly with honours and dishonoursthen that the proud man is concerned and at honours that are greatand conferred by good men he will be moderately pleased thinkingthat he is coming by his own or even less than his own for therecan be no honour that is worthy of perfect virtue yet he will atany rate accept it since they have nothing greater to bestow on himbut honour from casual people and on trifling grounds he will utterlydespise since it is not this that he deserves and dishonour toosince in his case it cannot be just in the first place then ashas been said the proud man is concerned with honours yet he willalso bear himself with moderation towards wealth and power and allgood or evil fortune whatever may befall him and will be neitheroverjoyed by good fortune nor overpained by evil for not even towardshonour does he bear himself as if it were a very great thing powerand wealth are desirable for the sake of honour at least those whohave them wish to get honour by means of them and for him to whomeven honour is a little thing the others must be so too hence proudmen are thought to be disdainful the goods of fortune also are thought to contribute towards pridefor men who are wellborn are thought worthy of honour and so arethose who enjoy power or wealth for they are in a superior positionand everything that has a superiority in something good is held ingreater honour hence even such things make men prouder for theyare honoured by some for having them but in truth the good man aloneis to be honoured he however who has both advantages is thoughtthe more worthy of honour but those who without virtue have suchgoods are neither justified in making great claims nor entitled tothe name of proud for these things imply perfect virtue disdainfuland insolent however even those who have such goods become forwithout virtue it is not easy to bear gracefully the goods of fortuneand being unable to bear them and thinking themselves superior toothers they despise others and themselves do what they please theyimitate the proud man without being like him and this they do wherethey can so they do not act virtuously but they do despise othersfor the proud man despises justly since he thinks truly but themany do so at random he does not run into trifling dangers nor is he fond of danger becausehe honours few things but he will face great dangers and when heis in danger he is unsparing of his life knowing that there are conditionson which life is not worth having and he is the sort of man to conferbenefits but he is ashamed of receiving them for the one is themark of a superior the other of an inferior and he is apt to confergreater benefits in return for thus the original benefactor besidesbeing paid will incur a debt to him and will be the gainer by thetransaction they seem also to remember any service they have donebut not those they have received for he who receives a service isinferior to him who has done it but the proud man wishes to be superiorand to hear of the former with pleasure of the latter with displeasurethis it seems is why thetis did not mention to zeus the servicesshe had done him and why the spartans did not recount their servicesto the athenians but those they had received it is a mark of theproud man also to ask for nothing or scarcely anything but to givehelp readily and to be dignified towards people who enjoy high positionand good fortune but unassuming towards those of the middle classfor it is a difficult and lofty thing to be superior to the formerbut easy to be so to the latter and a lofty bearing over the formeris no mark of illbreeding but among humble people it is as vulgaras a display of strength against the weak again it is characteristicof the proud man not to aim at the things commonly held in honouror the things in which others excel to be sluggish and to hold backexcept where great honour or a great work is at stake and to be aman of few deeds but of great and notable ones he must also be openin his hate and in his love for to conceal ones feelings ie tocare less for truth than for what people will think is a cowardspart and must speak and act openly for he is free of speech becausehe is contemptuous and he is given to telling the truth except whenhe speaks in irony to the vulgar he must be unable to make his liferevolve round another unless it be a friend for this is slavishand for this reason all flatterers are servile and people lackingin selfrespect are flatterers nor is he given to admiration fornothing to him is great nor is he mindful of wrongs for it is notthe part of a proud man to have a long memory especially for wrongsbut rather to overlook them nor is he a gossip for he will speakneither about himself nor about another since he cares not to bepraised nor for others to be blamed nor again is he given to praiseand for the same reason he is not an evilspeaker even about hisenemies except from haughtiness with regard to necessary or smallmatters he is least of all me given to lamentation or the asking offavours for it is the part of one who takes such matters seriouslyto behave so with respect to them he is one who will possess beautifuland profitless things rather than profitable and useful ones forthis is more proper to a character that suffices to itselffurther a slow step is thought proper to the proud man a deep voiceand a level utterance for the man who takes few things seriouslyis not likely to be hurried nor the man who thinks nothing greatto be excited while a shrill voice and a rapid gait are the resultsof hurry and excitement such then is the proud man the man who falls short of him is undulyhumble and the man who goes beyond him is vain now even these arenot thought to be bad for they are not malicious but only mistakenfor the unduly humble man being worthy of good things robs himselfof what he deserves and to have something bad about him from thefact that he does not think himself worthy of good things and seemsalso not to know himself else he would have desired the things hewas worthy of since these were good yet such people are not thoughtto be fools but rather unduly retiring such a reputation howeverseems actually to make them worse for each class of people aims atwhat corresponds to its worth and these people stand back even fromnoble actions and undertakings deeming themselves unworthy and fromexternal goods no less vain people on the other hand are foolsand ignorant of themselves and that manifestly for not being worthyof them they attempt honourable undertakings and then are foundout and tetadorn themselves with clothing and outward show and suchthings and wish their strokes of good fortune to be made publicand speak about them as if they would be honoured for them but unduehumility is more opposed to pride than vanity is for it is both commonerand worse pride then is concerned with honour on the grand scale as has beensaid  there seems to be in the sphere of honour also as was said in ourfirst remarks on the subject a virtue which would appear to be relatedto pride as liberality is to magnificence for neither of these hasanything to do with the grand scale but both dispose us as is rightwith regard to middling and unimportant objects as in getting andgiving of wealth there is a mean and an excess and defect so toohonour may be desired more than is right or less or from the rightsources and in the right way we blame both the ambitious man as amat honour more than is right and from wrong sources and the unambitiousman as not willing to be honoured even for noble reasons but sometimeswe praise the ambitious man as being manly and a lover of what isnoble and the unambitious man as being moderate and selfcontrolledas we said in our first treatment of the subject evidently sincefond of such and such an object has more than one meaning we donot assign the term ambition or love of honour always to the samething but when we praise the quality we think of the man who loveshonour more than most people and when we blame it we think of himwho loves it more than is right the mean being without a name theextremes seem to dispute for its place as though that were vacantby default but where there is excess and defect there is also anintermediate now men desire honour both more than they should andless therefore it is possible also to do so as one should at allevents this is the state of character that is praised being an unnamedmean in respect of honour relatively to ambition it seems to be unambitiousnessand relatively to unambitiousness it seems to be ambition while relativelyto both severally it seems in a sense to be both together this appearsto be true of the other virtues also but in this case the extremesseem to be contradictories because the mean has not received a name good temper is a mean with respect to anger the middle state beingunnamed and the extremes almost without a name as well we placegood temper in the middle position though it inclines towards thedeficiency which is without a name the excess might called a sortof irascibility for the passion is anger while its causes aremany and diverse the man who is angry at the right things and with the right peopleand further as he ought when he ought and as long as he oughtis praised this will be the goodtempered man then since good temperis praised for the goodtempered man tends to be unperturbed andnot to be led by passion but to be angry in the manner at the thingsand for the length of time that the rule dictates but he is thoughtto err rather in the direction of deficiency for the goodtemperedman is not revengeful but rather tends to make allowancesthe deficiency whether it is a sort of inirascibility or whateverit is is blamed for those who are not angry at the things they shouldbe angry at are thought to be fools and so are those who are notangry in the right way at the right time or with the right personsfor such a man is thought not to feel things nor to be pained by themand since he does not get angry he is thought unlikely to defendhimself and to endure being insulted and put up with insult to onesfriends is slavish the excess can be manifested in all the points that have been namedfor one can be angry with the wrong persons at the wrong thingsmore than is right too quickly or too long yet all are not foundin the same person indeed they could not for evil destroys evenitself and if it is complete becomes unbearable now hottemperedpeople get angry quickly and with the wrong persons and at the wrongthings and more than is right but their anger ceases quicklywhichis the best point about them this happens to them because they donot restrain their anger but retaliate openly owing to their quicknessof temper and then their anger ceases by reason of excess cholericpeople are quicktempered and ready to be angry with everything andon every occasion whence their name sulky people are hard to appeaseand retain their anger long for they repress their passion but itceases when they retaliate for revenge relieves them of their angerproducing in them pleasure instead of pain if this does not happenthey retain their burden for owing to its not being obvious no oneeven reasons with them and to digest ones anger in oneself takestime such people are most troublesome to themselves and to theirdearest friends we call hadtempered those who are angry at the wrongthings more than is right and longer and cannot be appeased untilthey inflict vengeance or punishment to good temper we oppose the excess rather than the defect for notonly is it commoner since revenge is the more human but badtemperedpeople are worse to live with what we have said in our earlier treatment of the subject is plainalso from what we are now saying viz that it is not easy to definehow with whom at what and how long one should be angry and atwhat point right action ceases and wrong begins for the man who straysa little from the path either towards the more or towards the lessis not blamed since sometimes we praise those who exhibit the deficiencyand call them goodtempered and sometimes we call angry people manlyas being capable of ruling how far therefore and how a man muststray before he becomes blameworthy it is not easy to state in wordsfor the decision depends on the particular facts and on perceptionbut so much at least is plain that the middle state is praiseworthythat in virtue of which we are angry with the right people at theright things in the right way and so on while the excesses anddefects are blameworthy slightly so if they are present in a lowdegree more if in a higher degree and very much if in a high degreeevidently then we must cling to the middle state enough of thestates relative to anger  in gatherings of men in social life and the interchange of wordsand deeds some men are thought to be obsequious viz those who togive pleasure praise everything and never oppose but think it theirduty to give no pain to the people they meet while those who onthe contrary oppose everything and care not a whit about giving painare called churlish and contentious that the states we have namedare culpable is plain enough and that the middle state is laudablethat in virtue of which a man will put up with and will resent theright things and in the right way but no name has been assigned toit though it most resembles friendship for the man who correspondsto this middle state is very much what with affection added we calla good friend but the state in question differs from friendship inthat it implies no passion or affection for ones associates sinceit is not by reason of loving or hating that such a man takes everythingin the right way but by being a man of a certain kind for he willbehave so alike towards those he knows and those he does not knowtowards intimates and those who are not so except that in each ofthese cases he will behave as is befitting for it is not proper tohave the same care for intimates and for strangers nor again is itthe same conditions that make it right to give pain to them now wehave said generally that he will associate with people in the rightway but it is by reference to what is honourable and expedient thathe will aim at not giving pain or at contributing pleasure for heseems to be concerned with the pleasures and pains of social lifeand wherever it is not honourable or is harmful for him to contributepleasure he will refuse and will choose rather to give pain alsoif his acquiescence in anothers action would bring disgrace andthat in a high degree or injury on that other while his oppositionbrings a little pain he will not acquiesce but will decline he willassociate differently with people in high station and with ordinarypeople with closer and more distant acquaintances and so too withregard to all other differences rendering to each class what is befittingand while for its own sake he chooses to contribute pleasure andavoids the giving of pain he will be guided by the consequencesif these are greater ie honour and expediency for the sake ofa great future pleasure too he will inflict small painsthe man who attains the mean then is such as we have describedbut has not received a name of those who contribute pleasure theman who aims at being pleasant with no ulterior object is obsequiousbut the man who does so in order that he may get some advantage inthe direction of money or the things that money buys is a flattererwhile the man who quarrels with everything is as has been said churlishand contentious and the extremes seem to be contradictory to eachother because the mean is without a name  the mean opposed to boastfulness is found in almost the same sphereand this also is without a name it will be no bad plan to describethese states as well for we shall both know the facts about characterbetter if we go through them in detail and we shall be convincedthat the virtues are means if we see this to be so in all cases inthe field of social life those who make the giving of pleasure orpain their object in associating with others have been describedlet us now describe those who pursue truth or falsehood alike in wordsand deeds and in the claims they put forward the boastful man thenis thought to be apt to claim the things that bring glory when hehas not got them or to claim more of them than he has and the mockmodestman on the other hand to disclaim what he has or belittle it whilethe man who observes the mean is one who calls a thing by its ownname being truthful both in life and in word owning to what he hasand neither more nor less now each of these courses may be adoptedeither with or without an object but each man speaks and acts andlives in accordance with his character if he is not acting for someulterior object and falsehood is in itself mean and culpable andtruth noble and worthy of praise thus the truthful man is anothercase of a man who being in the mean is worthy of praise and bothforms of untruthful man are culpable and particularly the boastfulman let us discuss them both but first of all the truthful man we arenot speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements ie inthe things that pertain to justice or injustice for this would belongto another virtue but the man who in the matters in which nothingof this sort is at stake is true both in word and in life becausehis character is such but such a man would seem to be as a matterof fact equitable for the man who loves truth and is truthful wherenothing is at stake will still more be truthful where something isat stake he will avoid falsehood as something base seeing that heavoided it even for its own sake and such a man is worthy of praisehe inclines rather to understate the truth for this seems in bettertaste because exaggerations are wearisome he who claims more than he has with no ulterior object is a contemptiblesort of fellow otherwise he would not have delighted in falsehoodbut seems futile rather than bad but if he does it for an objecthe who does it for the sake of reputation or honour is for a boasternot very much to be blamed but he who does it for money or the thingsthat lead to money is an uglier character it is not the capacitythat makes the boaster but the purpose for it is in virtue of hisstate of character and by being a man of a certain kind that he isboaster as one man is a liar because he enjoys the lie itself andanother because he desires reputation or gain now those who boastfor the sake of reputation claim such qualities as will praise orcongratulation but those whose object is gain claim qualities whichare of value to ones neighbours and ones lack of which is not easilydetected eg the powers of a seer a sage or a physician for thisreason it is such things as these that most people claim and boastabout for in them the abovementioned qualities are foundmockmodest people who understate things seem more attractive incharacter for they are thought to speak not for gain but to avoidparade and here too it is qualities which bring reputation that theydisclaim as socrates used to do those who disclaim trifling andobvious qualities are called humbugs and are more contemptible andsometimes this seems to be boastfulness like the spartan dress forboth excess and great deficiency are boastful but those who use understatementwith moderation and understate about matters that do not very muchforce themselves on our notice seem attractive and it is the boasterthat seems to be opposed to the truthful man for he is the worsecharacter  since life includes rest as well as activity and in this is includedleisure and amusement there seems here also to be a kind of intercoursewhich is tasteful there is such a thing as saying and again listeningto what one should and as one should the kind of people one is speakingor listening to will also make a difference evidently here also thereis both an excess and a deficiency as compared with the mean thosewho carry humour to excess are thought to be vulgar buffoons strivingafter humour at all costs and aiming rather at raising a laugh thanat saying what is becoming and at avoiding pain to the object of theirfun while those who can neither make a joke themselves nor put upwith those who do are thought to be boorish and unpolished but thosewho joke in a tasteful way are called readywitted which impliesa sort of readiness to turn this way and that for such sallies arethought to be movements of the character and as bodies are discriminatedby their movements so too are characters the ridiculous side ofthings is not far to seek however and most people delight more thanthey should in amusement and in jestinly and so even buffoons arecalled readywitted because they are found attractive but that theydiffer from the readywitted man and to no small extent is clearfrom what has been said to the middle state belongs also tact it is the mark of a tactfulman to say and listen to such things as befit a good and wellbredman for there are some things that it befits such a man to say andto hear by way of jest and the wellbred mans jesting differs fromthat of a vulgar man and the joking of an educated man from thatof an uneducated one may see this even from the old and the new comediesto the authors of the former indecency of language was amusing tothose of the latter innuendo is more so and these differ in no smalldegree in respect of propriety now should we define the man who jokeswell by his saying what is not unbecoming to a wellbred man or byhis not giving pain or even giving delight to the hearer or isthe latter definition at any rate itself indefinite since differentthings are hateful or pleasant to different people the kind of jokeshe will listen to will be the same for the kind he can put up withare also the kind he seems to make there are then jokes he willnot make for the jest is a sort of abuse and there are things thatlawgivers forbid us to abuse and they should perhaps have forbiddenus even to make a jest of such the refined and wellbred man thereforewill be as we have described being as it were a law to himselfsuch then is the man who observes the mean whether he be calledtactful or readywitted the buffoon on the other hand is the slaveof his sense of humour and spares neither himself nor others if hecan raise a laugh and says things none of which a man of refinementwould say and to some of which he would not even listen the booragain is useless for such social intercourse for he contributesnothing and finds fault with everything but relaxation and amusementare thought to be a necessary element in life the means in life that have been described then are three in numberand are all concerned with an interchange of words and deeds of somekind they differ however in that one is concerned with truth andthe other two with pleasantness of those concerned with pleasureone is displayed in jests the other in the general social intercourseof life  shame should not be described as a virtue for it is more like a feelingthan a state of character it is defined at any rate as a kind offear of dishonour and produces an effect similar to that producedby fear of danger for people who feel disgraced blush and thosewho fear death turn pale both therefore seem to be in a sense bodilyconditions which is thought to be characteristic of feeling ratherthan of a state of character the feeling is not becoming to every age but only to youth for wethink young people should be prone to the feeling of shame becausethey live by feeling and therefore commit many errors but are restrainedby shame and we praise young people who are prone to this feelingbut an older person no one would praise for being prone to the senseof disgrace since we think he should not do anything that need causethis sense for the sense of disgrace is not even characteristic ofa good man since it is consequent on bad actions for such actionsshould not be done and if some actions are disgraceful in very truthand others only according to common opinion this makes no differencefor neither class of actions should be done so that no disgrace shouldbe felt and it is a mark of a bad man even to be such as to do anydisgraceful action to be so constituted as to feel disgraced if onedoes such an action and for this reason to think oneself good isabsurd for it is for voluntary actions that shame is felt and thegood man will never voluntarily do bad actions but shame may be saidto be conditionally a good thing if a good man does such actionshe will feel disgraced but the virtues are not subject to such aqualification and if shamelessnessnot to be ashamed of doing baseactionsis bad that does not make it good to be ashamed of doingsuch actions continence too is not virtue but a mixed sort of statethis will be shown later now however let us discuss justicebook v with regards to justice and injustice we must  consider what kindof actions they are concerned with  what sort of mean justiceis and  between what extremes the just act is intermediate ourinvestigation shall follow the same course as the preceding discussionswe see that all men mean by justice that kind of state of characterwhich makes people disposed to do what is just and makes them actjustly and wish for what is just and similarly by injustice thatstate which makes them act unjustly and wish for what is unjust letus too then lay this down as a general basis for the same is nottrue of the sciences and the faculties as of states of charactera faculty or a science which is one and the same is held to relateto contrary objects but a state of character which is one of twocontraries does not produce the contrary results eg as a resultof health we do not do what is the opposite of healthy but only whatis healthy for we say a man walks healthily when he walks as a healthyman would now often one contrary state is recognized from its contrary andoften states are recognized from the subjects that exhibit them fora if good condition is known bad condition also becomes knownand b good condition is known from the things that are in good conditionand they from it if good condition is firmness of flesh it is necessaryboth that bad condition should be flabbiness of flesh and that thewholesome should be that which causes firmness in flesh and it followsfor the most part that if one contrary is ambiguous the other alsowill be ambiguous eg if just is so that unjust will be sotoo now justice and injustice seem to be ambiguous but because theirdifferent meanings approach near to one another the ambiguity escapesnotice and is not obvious as it is comparatively when the meaningsare far apart eg for here the difference in outward form is greatas the ambiguity in the use of kleis for the collarbone of an animaland for that with which we lock a door let us take as a startingpointthen the various meanings of an unjust man both the lawless manand the grasping and unfair man are thought to be unjust so thatevidently both the lawabiding and the fair man will be just thejust then is the lawful and the fair the unjust the unlawful andthe unfair since the unjust man is grasping he must be concerned with goodsnotall goods but those with which prosperity and adversity have to dowhich taken absolutely are always good but for a particular personare not always good now men pray for and pursue these things butthey should not but should pray that the things that are good absolutelymay also be good for them and should choose the things that are goodfor them the unjust man does not always choose the greater but alsothe lessin the case of things bad absolutely but because the lesserevil is itself thought to be in a sense good and graspingness isdirected at the good therefore he is thought to be grasping andhe is unfair for this contains and is common to both since the lawless man was seen to be unjust and the lawabiding manjust evidently all lawful acts are in a sense just acts for theacts laid down by the legislative art are lawful and each of thesewe say is just now the laws in their enactments on all subjectsaim at the common advantage either of all or of the best or of thosewho hold power or something of the sort so that in one sense wecall those acts just that tend to produce and preserve happiness andits components for the political society and the law bids us do boththe acts of a brave man eg not to desert our post nor take to flightnor throw away our arms and those of a temperate man eg not tocommit adultery nor to gratify ones lust and those of a goodtemperedman eg not to strike another nor to speak evil and similarlywith regard to the other virtues and forms of wickedness commandingsome acts and forbidding others and the rightlyframed law does thisrightly and the hastily conceived one less well this form of justicethen is complete virtue but not absolutely but in relation to ourneighbour and therefore justice is often thought to be the greatestof virtues and neither evening nor morning star is so wonderfuland proverbially in justice is every virtue comprehended and itis complete virtue in its fullest sense because it is the actualexercise of complete virtue it is complete because he who possessesit can exercise his virtue not only in himself but towards his neighbouralso for many men can exercise virtue in their own affairs but notin their relations to their neighbour this is why the saying of biasis thought to be true that rule will show the man for a ruleris necessarily in relation to other men and a member of a societyfor this same reason justice alone of the virtues is thought tobe anothers good because it is related to our neighbour for itdoes what is advantageous to another either a ruler or a copartnernow the worst man is he who exercises his wickedness both towardshimself and towards his friends and the best man is not he who exerciseshis virtue towards himself but he who exercises it towards anotherfor this is a difficult task justice in this sense then is notpart of virtue but virtue entire nor is the contrary injustice apart of vice but vice entire what the difference is between virtueand justice in this sense is plain from what we have said they arethe same but their essence is not the same what as a relation toones neighbour is justice is as a certain kind of state withoutqualification virtue  but at all events what we are investigating is the justice which isa part of virtue for there is a justice of this kind as we maintainsimilarly it is with injustice in the particular sense that we areconcerned that there is such a thing is indicated by the fact that while theman who exhibits in action the other forms of wickedness acts wronglyindeed but not graspingly eg the man who throws away his shieldthrough cowardice or speaks harshly through bad temper or fails tohelp a friend with money through meanness when a man acts graspinglyhe often exhibits none of these vicesno nor all together but certainlywickedness of some kind for we blame him and injustice there isthen another kind of injustice which is a part of injustice in thewide sense and a use of the word unjust which answers to a partof what is unjust in the wide sense of contrary to the law againif one man commits adultery for the sake of gain and makes money byit while another does so at the bidding of appetite though he losesmoney and is penalized for it the latter would be held to be selfindulgentrather than grasping but the former is unjust but not selfindulgentevidently therefore he is unjust by reason of his making gain byhis act again all other unjust acts are ascribed invariably to someparticular kind of wickedness eg adultery to selfindulgence thedesertion of a comrade in battle to cowardice physical violence toanger but if a man makes gain his action is ascribed to no formof wickedness but injustice evidently therefore there is apartfrom injustice in the wide sense another particular injusticewhich shares the name and nature of the first because its definitionfalls within the same genus for the significance of both consistsin a relation to ones neighbour but the one is concerned with honouror money or safetyor that which includes all these if we had a singlename for itand its motive is the pleasure that arises from gainwhile the other is concerned with all the objects with which the goodman is concerned it is clear then that there is more than one kind of justice andthat there is one which is distinct from virtue entire we must tryto grasp its genus and differentia the unjust has been divided into the unlawful and the unfair andthe just into the lawful and the fair to the unlawful answers theaforementioned sense of injustice but since unfair and the unlawfulare not the same but are different as a part is from its whole forall that is unfair is unlawful but not all that is unlawful is unfairthe unjust and injustice in the sense of the unfair are not the sameas but different from the former kind as part from whole for injusticein this sense is a part of injustice in the wide sense and similarlyjustice in the one sense of justice in the other therefore we mustspeak also about particular justice and particular and similarly aboutthe just and the unjust the justice then which answers to the wholeof virtue and the corresponding injustice one being the exerciseof virtue as a whole and the other that of vice as a whole towardsones neighbour we may leave on one side and how the meanings ofjust and unjust which answer to these are to be distinguishedis evident for practically the majority of the acts commanded bythe law are those which are prescribed from the point of view of virtuetaken as a whole for the law bids us practise every virtue and forbidsus to practise any vice and the things that tend to produce virtuetaken as a whole are those of the acts prescribed by the law whichhave been prescribed with a view to education for the common goodbut with regard to the education of the individual as such whichmakes him without qualification a good man we must determine laterwhether this is the function of the political art or of another forperhaps it is not the same to be a good man and a good citizen ofany state taken at random of particular justice and that which is just in the correspondingsense a one kind is that which is manifested in distributions ofhonour or money or the other things that fall to be divided amongthose who have a share in the constitution for in these it is possiblefor one man to have a share either unequal or equal to that of anotherand b one is that which plays a rectifying part in transactionsbetween man and man of this there are two divisions of transactions some are voluntary and  others involuntary voluntary suchtransactions as sale purchase loan for consumption pledging loanfor use depositing letting they are called voluntary because theorigin of these transactions is voluntary while of the involuntarya some are clandestine such as theft adultery poisoning procuringenticement of slaves assassination false witness and b othersare violent such as assault imprisonment murder robbery with violencemutilation abuse insult  a we have shown that both the unjust man and the unjust act areunfair or unequal now it is clear that there is also an intermediatebetween the two unequals involved in either case and this is theequal for in any kind of action in which theres a more and a lessthere is also what is equal if then the unjust is unequal justis equal as all men suppose it to be even apart from argument andsince the equal is intermediate the just will be an intermediatenow equality implies at least two things the just then must beboth intermediate and equal and relative ie for certain personsand since the equall intermediate it must be between certain thingswhich are respectively greater and less equal it involves twothings qua just it is for certain people the just therefore involvesat least four terms for the persons for whom it is in fact just aretwo and the things in which it is manifested the objects distributedare two and the same equality will exist between the persons andbetween the things concerned for as the latter the things concernedarerelated so are the former if they are not equal they will not havewhat is equal but this is the origin of quarrels and complaintswheneither equals have and are awarded unequal shares or unequals equalshares further this is plain from the fact that awards should beaccording to merit for all men agree that what is just in distributionmust be according to merit in some sense though they do not all specifythe same sort of merit but democrats identify it with the statusof freeman supporters of oligarchy with wealth or with noble birthand supporters of aristocracy with excellence the just then is a species of the proportionate proportion beingnot a property only of the kind of number which consists of abstractunits but of number in general for proportion is equality of ratiosand involves four terms at least that discrete proportion involvesfour terms is plain but so does continuous proportion for it usesone term as two and mentions it twice eg as the line a is to theline b so is the line b to the line c the line b then has beenmentioned twice so that if the line b be assumed twice the proportionalterms will be four and the just too involves at least four termsand the ratio between one pair is the same as that between the otherpair for there is a similar distinction between the persons and betweenthe things as the term a then is to b so will c be to d and thereforealternando as a is to c b will be to d therefore also the wholeis in the same ratio to the whole and this coupling the distributioneffects and if the terms are so combined effects justly the conjunctionthen of the term a with c and of b with d is what is just in distributionand this species of the just is intermediate and the unjust is whatviolates the proportion for the proportional is intermediate andthe just is proportional mathematicians call this kind of proportiongeometrical for it is in geometrical proportion that it follows thatthe whole is to the whole as either part is to the corresponding partthis proportion is not continuous for we cannot get a single termstanding for a person and a thing this then is what the just isthe proportional the unjust is whatviolates the proportion hence one term becomes too great the othertoo small as indeed happens in practice for the man who acts unjustlyhas too much and the man who is unjustly treated too little of whatis good in the case of evil the reverse is true for the lesser evilis reckoned a good in comparison with the greater evil since thelesser evil is rather to be chosen than the greater and what is worthyof choice is good and what is worthier of choice a greater goodthis then is one species of the just  b the remaining one is the rectificatory which arises in connexionwith transactions both voluntary and involuntary this form of thejust has a different specific character from the former for the justicewhich distributes common possessions is always in accordance withthe kind of proportion mentioned above for in the case also in whichthe distribution is made from the common funds of a partnership itwill be according to the same ratio which the funds put into the businessby the partners bear to one another and the injustice opposed tothis kind of justice is that which violates the proportion but thejustice in transactions between man and man is a sort of equalityindeed and the injustice a sort of inequality not according to thatkind of proportion however but according to arithmetical proportionfor it makes no difference whether a good man has defrauded a badman or a bad man a good one nor whether it is a good or a bad manthat has committed adultery the law looks only to the distinctivecharacter of the injury and treats the parties as equal if one isin the wrong and the other is being wronged and if one inflictedinjury and the other has received it therefore this kind of injusticebeing an inequality the judge tries to equalize it for in the casealso in which one has received and the other has inflicted a woundor one has slain and the other been slain the suffering and the actionhave been unequally distributed but the judge tries to equalize bymeans of the penalty taking away from the gain of the assailantfor the term gain is applied generally to such cases even if itbe not a term appropriate to certain cases eg to the person whoinflicts a woundand loss to the sufferer at all events when thesuffering has been estimated the one is called loss and the othergain therefore the equal is intermediate between the greater andthe less but the gain and the loss are respectively greater and lessin contrary ways more of the good and less of the evil are gainand the contrary is loss intermediate between them is as we sawequal which we say is just therefore corrective justice will bethe intermediate between loss and gain this is why when people disputethey take refuge in the judge and to go to the judge is to go tojustice for the nature of the judge is to be a sort of animate justiceand they seek the judge as an intermediate and in some states theycall judges mediators on the assumption that if they get what isintermediate they will get what is just the just then is an intermediatesince the judge is so now the judge restores equality it is as thoughthere were a line divided into unequal parts and he took away thatby which the greater segment exceeds the half and added it to thesmaller segment and when the whole has been equally divided thenthey say they have their ownie when they have got what is equalthe equal is intermediate between the greater and the lesser lineaccording to arithmetical proportion it is for this reason also thatit is called just sikaion because it is a division into two equalparts sicha just as if one were to call it sichaion and the judgesikastes is one who bisects sichastes for when something is subtractedfrom one of two equals and added to the other the other is in excessby these two since if what was taken from the one had not been addedto the other the latter would have been in excess by one only ittherefore exceeds the intermediate by one and the intermediate exceedsby one that from which something was taken by this then we shallrecognize both what we must subtract from that which has more andwhat we must add to that which has less we must add to the latterthat by which the intermediate exceeds it and subtract from the greatestthat by which it exceeds the intermediate let the lines aa bbcc be equal to one another from the line aa let the segment aehave been subtracted and to the line cc let the segment cd havebeen added so that the whole line dcc exceeds the line ea by thesegment cd and the segment cf therefore it exceeds the line bb bythe segment cd see diagram these names both loss and gain have come from voluntary exchangefor to have more than ones own is called gaining and to have lessthan ones original share is called losing eg in buying and sellingand in all other matters in which the law has left people free tomake their own terms but when they get neither more nor less butjust what belongs to themselves they say that they have their ownand that they neither lose nor gain therefore the just is intermediate between a sort of gain and a sortof loss viz those which are involuntary it consists in having anequal amount before and after the transaction  some think that reciprocity is without qualification just as thepythagoreans said for they defined justice without qualificationas reciprocity now reciprocity fits neither distributive nor rectificatoryjusticeyet people want even the justice of rhadamanthus to mean thisshould a man suffer what he did right justice would be done forin many cases reciprocity and rectificatory justice are not in accordeg  if an official has inflicted a wound he should not be woundedin return and if some one has wounded an official he ought not tobe wounded only but punished in addition further  there is a greatdifference between a voluntary and an involuntary act but in associationsfor exchange this sort of justice does hold men togetherreciprocityin accordance with a proportion and not on the basis of preciselyequal return for it is by proportionate requital that the city holdstogether men seek to return either evil for eviland if they cananot do so think their position mere slaveryor good for goodandif they cannot do so there is no exchange but it is by exchange thatthey hold together this is why they give a prominent place to thetemple of the gracesto promote the requital of services for thisis characteristic of gracewe should serve in return one who has showngrace to us and should another time take the initiative in showingit now proportionate return is secured by crossconjunction let a bea builder b a shoemaker c a house d a shoe the builder thenmust get from the shoemaker the latters work and must himself givehim in return his own if then first there is proportionate equalityof goods and then reciprocal action takes place the result we mentionwill be effected if not the bargain is not equal and does not holdfor there is nothing to prevent the work of the one being better thanthat of the other they must therefore be equated and this is trueof the other arts also for they would have been destroyed if whatthe patient suffered had not been just what the agent did and ofthe same amount and kind for it is not two doctors that associatefor exchange but a doctor and a farmer or in general people whoare different and unequal but these must be equated this is whyall things that are exchanged must be somehow comparable it is forthis end that money has been introduced and it becomes in a sensean intermediate for it measures all things and therefore the excessand the defecthow many shoes are equal to a house or to a given amountof food the number of shoes exchanged for a house or for a givenamount of food must therefore correspond to the ratio of builderto shoemaker for if this be not so there will be no exchange andno intercourse and this proportion will not be effected unless thegoods are somehow equal all goods must therefore be measured by someone thing as we said before now this unit is in truth demand whichholds all things together for if men did not need one anothers goodsat all or did not need them equally there would be either no exchangeor not the same exchange but money has become by convention a sortof representative of demand and this is why it has the name moneynomismabecause it exists not by nature but by law nomos and itis in our power to change it and make it useless there will thenbe reciprocity when the terms have been equated so that as farmeris to shoemaker the amount of the shoemakers work is to that ofthe farmers work for which it exchanges but we must not bring theminto a figure of proportion when they have already exchanged otherwiseone extreme will have both excesses but when they still have theirown goods thus they are equals and associates just because this equalitycan be effected in their case let a be a farmer c food b a shoemakerd his product equated to c if it had not been possible for reciprocityto be thus effected there would have been no association of the partiesthat demand holds things together as a single unit is shown by thefact that when men do not need one another ie when neither needsthe other or one does not need the other they do not exchange aswe do when some one wants what one has oneself eg when people permitthe exportation of corn in exchange for wine this equation thereforemust be established and for the future exchangethat if we do notneed a thing now we shall have it if ever we do need itmoney is asit were our surety for it must be possible for us to get what wewant by bringing the money now the same thing happens to money itselfas to goodsit is not always worth the same yet it tends to be steadierthis is why all goods must have a price set on them for then therewill always be exchange and if so association of man with man moneythen acting as a measure makes goods commensurate and equates themfor neither would there have been association if there were not exchangenor exchange if there were not equality nor equality if there werenot commensurability now in truth it is impossible that things differingso much should become commensurate but with reference to demand theymay become so sufficiently there must then be a unit and thatfixed by agreement for which reason it is called money for it isthis that makes all things commensurate since all things are measuredby money let a be a house b ten minae c a bed a is half of bif the house is worth five minae or equal to them the bed c isa tenth of b it is plain then how many beds are equal to a houseviz five that exchange took place thus before there was money isplain for it makes no difference whether it is five beds that exchangefor a house or the money value of five beds we have now defined the unjust and the just these having been markedoff from each other it is plain that just action is intermediatebetween acting unjustly and being unjustly treated for the one isto have too much and the other to have too little justice is a kindof mean but not in the same way as the other virtues but becauseit relates to an intermediate amount while injustice relates to theextremes and justice is that in virtue of which the just man is saidto be a doer by choice of that which is just and one who will distributeeither between himself and another or between two others not so asto give more of what is desirable to himself and less to his neighbourand conversely with what is harmful but so as to give what is equalin accordance with proportion and similarly in distributing betweentwo other persons injustice on the other hand is similarly relatedto the unjust which is excess and defect contrary to proportionof the useful or hurtful for which reason injustice is excess anddefect viz because it is productive of excess and defectin onesown case excess of what is in its own nature useful and defect ofwhat is hurtful while in the case of others it is as a whole likewhat it is in ones own case but proportion may be violated in eitherdirection in the unjust act to have too little is to be unjustlytreated to have too much is to act unjustly let this be taken as our account of the nature of justice and injusticeand similarly of the just and the unjust in general  since acting unjustly does not necessarily imply being unjust wemust ask what sort of unjust acts imply that the doer is unjust withrespect to each type of injustice eg a thief an adulterer ora brigand surely the answer does not turn on the difference betweenthese types for a man might even lie with a woman knowing who shewas but the origin of his might be not deliberate choice but passionhe acts unjustly then but is not unjust eg a man is not a thiefyet he stole nor an adulterer yet he committed adultery and similarlyin all other cases now we have previously stated how the reciprocal is related to thejust but we must not forget that what we are looking for is not onlywhat is just without qualification but also political justice thisis found among men who share their life with a view to selfsufficiencymen who are free and either proportionately or arithmetically equalso that between those who do not fulfil this condition there is nopolitical justice but justice in a special sense and by analogy forjustice exists only between men whose mutual relations are governedby law and law exists for men between whom there is injustice forlegal justice is the discrimination of the just and the unjust andbetween men between whom there is injustice there is also unjust actionthough there is not injustice between all between whom there is unjustaction and this is assigning too much to oneself of things goodin themselves and too little of things evil in themselves this iswhy we do not allow a man to rule but rational principle becausea man behaves thus in his own interests and becomes a tyrant themagistrate on the other hand is the guardian of justice and if ofjustice then of equality also and since he is assumed to have nomore than his share if he is just for he does not assign to himselfmore of what is good in itself unless such a share is proportionalto his meritsso that it is for others that he labours and it isfor this reason that men as we stated previously say that justiceis anothers good therefore a reward must be given him and thisis honour and privilege but those for whom such things are not enoughbecome tyrants the justice of a master and that of a father are not the same as thejustice of citizens though they are like it for there can be noinjustice in the unqualified sense towards thing that are ones ownbut a mans chattel and his child until it reaches a certain ageand sets up for itself are as it were part of himself and no onechooses to hurt himself for which reason there can be no injusticetowards oneself therefore the justice or injustice of citizens isnot manifested in these relations for it was as we saw accordingto law and between people naturally subject to law and these aswe saw are people who have an equal share in ruling and being ruledhence justice can more truly be manifested towards a wife than towardschildren and chattels for the former is household justice but eventhis is different from political justice  of political justice part is natural part legal natural that whicheverywhere has the same force and does not exist by peoples thinkingthis or that legal that which is originally indifferent but whenit has been laid down is not indifferent eg that a prisoners ransomshall be a mina or that a goat and not two sheep shall be sacrificedand again all the laws that are passed for particular cases egthat sacrifice shall be made in honour of brasidas and the provisionsof decrees now some think that all justice is of this sort becausethat which is by nature is unchangeable and has everywhere the sameforce as fire burns both here and in persia while they see changein the things recognized as just this however is not true in thisunqualified way but is true in a sense or rather with the godsit is perhaps not true at all while with us there is something thatis just even by nature yet all of it is changeable but still someis by nature some not by nature it is evident which sort of thingamong things capable of being otherwise is by nature and which isnot but is legal and conventional assuming that both are equallychangeable and in all other things the same distinction will applyby nature the right hand is stronger yet it is possible that allmen should come to be ambidextrous the things which are just by virtueof convention and expediency are like measures for wine and cornmeasures are not everywhere equal but larger in wholesale and smallerin retail markets similarly the things which are just not by naturebut by human enactment are not everywhere the same since constitutionsalso are not the same though there is but one which is everywhereby nature the best of things just and lawful each is related as theuniversal to its particulars for the things that are done are manybut of them each is one since it is universal there is a difference between the act of injustice and what is unjustand between the act of justice and what is just for a thing is unjustby nature or by enactment and this very thing when it has been doneis an act of injustice but before it is done is not yet that butis unjust so too with an act of justice though the general termis rather just action and act of justice is applied to the correctionof the act of injustice each of these must later be examined separately with regard to thenature and number of its species and the nature of the things withwhich it is concerned  acts just and unjust being as we have described them a man acts unjustlyor justly whenever he does such acts voluntarily when involuntarilyhe acts neither unjustly nor justly except in an incidental way forhe does things which happen to be just or unjust whether an act isor is not one of injustice or of justice is determined by its voluntarinessor involuntariness for when it is voluntary it is blamed and atthe same time is then an act of injustice so that there will be thingsthat are unjust but not yet acts of injustice if voluntariness benot present as well by the voluntary i mean as has been said beforeany of the things in a mans own power which he does with knowledgeie not in ignorance either of the person acted on or of the instrumentused or of the end that will be attained eg whom he is strikingwith what and to what end each such act being done not incidentallynor under compulsion eg if a takes bs hand and therewith strikesc b does not act voluntarily for the act was not in his own powerthe person struck may be the strikers father and the striker mayknow that it is a man or one of the persons present but not knowthat it is his father a similar distinction may be made in the caseof the end and with regard to the whole action therefore that whichis done in ignorance or though not done in ignorance is not in theagents power or is done under compulsion is involuntary for manynatural processes even we knowingly both perform and experiencenone of which is either voluntary or involuntary eg growing oldor dying but in the case of unjust and just acts alike the injusticeor justice may be only incidental for a man might return a depositunwillingly and from fear and then he must not be said either todo what is just or to act justly except in an incidental way similarlythe man who under compulsion and unwillingly fails to return the depositmust be said to act unjustly and to do what is unjust only incidentallyof voluntary acts we do some by choice others not by choice by choicethose which we do after deliberation not by choice those which wedo without previous deliberation thus there are three kinds of injuryin transactions between man and man those done in ignorance are mistakeswhen the person acted on the act the instrument or the end thatwill be attained is other than the agent supposed the agent thoughteither that he was not hiting any one or that he was not hitting withthis missile or not hitting this person or to this end but a resultfollowed other than that which he thought likely eg he threw notwith intent to wound but only to prick or the person hit or themissile was other than he supposed now when  the injury takesplace contrary to reasonable expectation it is a misadventure when it is not contrary to reasonable expectation but does not implyvice it is a mistake for a man makes a mistake when the fault originatesin him but is the victim of accident when the origin lies outsidehim when  he acts with knowledge but not after deliberationit is an act of injusticeeg the acts due to anger or to other passionsnecessary or natural to man for when men do such harmful and mistakenacts they act unjustly and the acts are acts of injustice but thisdoes not imply that the doers are unjust or wicked for the injuryis not due to vice but when  a man acts from choice he is anunjust man and a vicious man hence acts proceeding from anger are rightly judged not to be doneof malice aforethought for it is not the man who acts in anger buthe who enraged him that starts the mischief again the matter indispute is not whether the thing happened or not but its justicefor it is apparent injustice that occasions rage for they do notdispute about the occurrence of the actas in commercial transactionswhere one of the two parties must be viciousunless they do so owingto forgetfulness but agreeing about the fact they dispute on whichside justice lies whereas a man who has deliberately injured anothercannot help knowing that he has done so so that the one thinks heis being treated unjustly and the other disagrees but if a man harms another by choice he acts unjustly and theseare the acts of injustice which imply that the doer is an unjust manprovided that the act violates proportion or equality similarlya man is just when he acts justly by choice but he acts justly ifhe merely acts voluntarily of involuntary acts some are excusable others not for the mistakeswhich men make not only in ignorance but also from ignorance are excusablewhile those which men do not from ignorance but though they do themin ignorance owing to a passion which is neither natural nor suchas man is liable to are not excusable  assuming that we have sufficiently defined the suffering and doingof injustice it may be asked  whether the truth in expressed ineuripides paradoxical words i slew my mother thats my tale in brief were you both willing or unwilling both is it truly possible to be willingly treated unjustly or is all sufferingof injustice the contrary involuntary as all unjust action is voluntaryand is all suffering of injustice of the latter kind or else all ofthe former or is it sometimes voluntary sometimes involuntary sotoo with the case of being justly treated all just action is voluntaryso that it is reasonable that there should be a similar oppositionin either casethat both being unjustly and being justly treated shouldbe either alike voluntary or alike involuntary but it would be thoughtparadoxical even in the case of being justly treated if it were alwaysvoluntary for some are unwillingly treated justly  one mightraise this question also whether every one who has suffered whatis unjust is being unjustly treated or on the other hand it is withsuffering as with acting in action and in passivity alike it is possibleto partake of justice incidentally and similarly it is plain ofinjustice for to do what is unjust is not the same as to act unjustlynor to suffer what is unjust as to be treated unjustly and similarlyin the case of acting justly and being justly treated for it is impossibleto be unjustly treated if the other does not act unjustly or justlytreated unless he acts justly now if to act unjustly is simply toharm some one voluntarily and voluntarily means knowing the personacted on the instrument and the manner of ones acting and theincontinent man voluntarily harms himself not only will he voluntarilybe unjustly treated but it will be possible to treat oneself unjustlythis also is one of the questions in doubt whether a man can treathimself unjustly again a man may voluntarily owing to incontinencebe harmed by another who acts voluntarily so that it would be possibleto be voluntarily treated unjustly or is our definition incorrectmust we to harming another with knowledge both of the person actedon of the instrument and of the manner add contrary to the wishof the person acted on then a man may be voluntarily harmed andvoluntarily suffer what is unjust but no one is voluntarily treatedunjustly for no one wishes to be unjustly treated not even the incontinentman he acts contrary to his wish for no one wishes for what he doesnot think to be good but the incontinent man does do things thathe does not think he ought to do again one who gives what is hisown as homer says glaucus gave diomede armour of gold for brazen the price of a hundred beeves for nineis not unjustly treated for though to give is in his power to beunjustly treated is not but there must be some one to treat him unjustlyit is plain then that being unjustly treated is not voluntaryof the questions we intended to discuss two still remain for discussion whether it is the man who has assigned to another more than hisshare that acts unjustly or he who has the excessive share and whether it is possible to treat oneself unjustly the questions areconnected for if the former alternative is possible and the distributoracts unjustly and not the man who has the excessive share then ifa man assigns more to another than to himself knowingly and voluntarilyhe treats himself unjustly which is what modest people seem to dosince the virtuous man tends to take less than his share or doesthis statement too need qualification for a he perhaps gets morethan his share of some other good eg of honour or of intrinsicnobility b the question is solved by applying the distinction weapplied to unjust action for he suffers nothing contrary to his ownwish so that he is not unjustly treated as far as this goes butat most only suffers harm it is plain too that the distributor acts unjustly but not alwaysthe man who has the excessive share for it is not he to whom whatis unjust appertains that acts unjustly but he to whom it appertainsto do the unjust act voluntarily ie the person in whom lies theorigin of the action and this lies in the distributor not in thereceiver again since the word do is ambiguous and there is asense in which lifeless things or a hand or a servant who obeysan order may be said to slay he who gets an excessive share doesnot act unjustly though he does what is unjust again if the distributor gave his judgement in ignorance he doesnot act unjustly in respect of legal justice and his judgement isnot unjust in this sense but in a sense it is unjust for legal justiceand primordial justice are different but if with knowledge he judgedunjustly he is himself aiming at an excessive share either of gratitudeor of revenge as much then as if he were to share in the plunderthe man who has judged unjustly for these reasons has got too muchthe fact that what he gets is different from what he distributes makesno difference for even if he awards land with a view to sharing inthe plunder he gets not land but money men think that acting unjustly is in their power and therefore thatbeing just is easy but it is not to lie with ones neighbours wifeto wound another to deliver a bribe is easy and in our power butto do these things as a result of a certain state of character isneither easy nor in our power similarly to know what is just andwhat is unjust requires men think no great wisdom because it isnot hard to understand the matters dealt with by the laws thoughthese are not the things that are just except incidentally buthow actions must be done and distributions effected in order to bejust to know this is a greater achievement than knowing what is goodfor the health though even there while it is easy to know that honeywine hellebore cautery and the use of the knife are so to knowhow to whom and when these should be applied with a view to producinghealth is no less an achievement than that of being a physicianagain for this very reason men think that acting unjustly is characteristicof the just man no less than of the unjust because he would be notless but even more capable of doing each of these unjust acts forhe could lie with a woman or wound a neighbour and the brave mancould throw away his shield and turn to flight in this direction orin that but to play the coward or to act unjustly consists not indoing these things except incidentally but in doing them as theresult of a certain state of character just as to practise medicineand healing consists not in applying or not applying the knife inusing or not using medicines but in doing so in a certain wayjust acts occur between people who participate in things good in themselvesand can have too much or too little of them for some beings egpresumably the gods cannot have too much of them and to othersthose who are incurably bad not even the smallest share in them isbeneficial but all such goods are harmful while to others they arebeneficial up to a point therefore justice is essentially somethinghuman  our next subject is equity and the equitable to epiekes and theirrespective relations to justice and the just for on examination theyappear to be neither absolutely the same nor generically differentand while we sometime praise what is equitable and the equitable manso that we apply the name by way of praise even to instances of theother virtues instead of good meaning by epieikestebon that a thingis better at other times when we reason it out it seems strangeif the equitable being something different from the just is yetpraiseworthy for either the just or the equitable is not good ifthey are different or if both are good they are the samethese then are pretty much the considerations that give rise tothe problem about the equitable they are all in a sense correct andnot opposed to one another for the equitable though it is betterthan one kind of justice yet is just and it is not as being a differentclass of thing that it is better than the just the same thing thenis just and equitable and while both are good the equitable is superiorwhat creates the problem is that the equitable is just but not thelegally just but a correction of legal justice the reason is thatall law is universal but about some things it is not possible to makea universal statement which shall be correct in those cases thenin which it is necessary to speak universally but not possible todo so correctly the law takes the usual case though it is not ignorantof the possibility of error and it is none the less correct forthe error is in the law nor in the legislator but in the nature ofthe thing since the matter of practical affairs is of this kind fromthe start when the law speaks universally then and a case ariseson it which is not covered by the universal statement then it isright where the legislator fails us and has erred by oversimplicityto correct the omissionto say what the legislator himself would havesaid had he been present and would have put into his law if he hadknown hence the equitable is just and better than one kind of justicenotbetter than absolute justice but better than the error that arisesfrom the absoluteness of the statement and this is the nature ofthe equitable a correction of law where it is defective owing toits universality in fact this is the reason why all things are notdetermined by law that about some things it is impossible to laydown a law so that a decree is needed for when the thing is indefinitethe rule also is indefinite like the leaden rule used in making thelesbian moulding the rule adapts itself to the shape of the stoneand is not rigid and so too the decree is adapted to the factsit is plain then what the equitable is and that it is just andis better than one kind of justice it is evident also from this whothe equitable man is the man who chooses and does such acts andis no stickler for his rights in a bad sense but tends to take lessthan his share though he has the law oft his side is equitable andthis state of character is equity which is a sort of justice andnot a different state of character  whether a man can treat himself unjustly or not is evident from whathas been said for a one class of just acts are those acts in accordancewith any virtue which are prescribed by the law eg the law doesnot expressly permit suicide and what it does not expressly permitit forbids again when a man in violation of the law harms anotherotherwise than in retaliation voluntarily he acts unjustly anda voluntary agent is one who knows both the person he is affectingby his action and the instrument he is using and he who through angervoluntarily stabs himself does this contrary to the right rule oflife and this the law does not allow therefore he is acting unjustlybut towards whom surely towards the state not towards himself forhe suffers voluntarily but no one is voluntarily treated unjustlythis is also the reason why the state punishes a certain loss ofcivil rights attaches to the man who destroys himself on the groundthat he is treating the state unjustly further b in that sense of acting unjustly in which the man whoacts unjustly is unjust only and not bad all round it is not possibleto treat oneself unjustly this is different from the former sensethe unjust man in one sense of the term is wicked in a particularizedway just as the coward is not in the sense of being wicked all roundso that his unjust act does not manifest wickedness in generalfor i that would imply the possibility of the same things havingbeen subtracted from and added to the same thing at the same timebut this is impossiblethe just and the unjust always involve morethan one person further ii unjust action is voluntary and doneby choice and takes the initiative for the man who because he hassuffered does the same in return is not thought to act unjustlybut if a man harms himself he suffers and does the same things atthe same time further iii if a man could treat himself unjustlyhe could be voluntarily treated unjustly besides iv no one actsunjustly without committing particular acts of injustice but no onecan commit adultery with his own wife or housebreaking on his ownhouse or theft on his own property in general the question can a man treat himself unjustly is solvedalso by the distinction we applied to the question can a man be voluntarilytreated unjustly it is evident too that both are bad being unjustly treated and actingunjustly for the one means having less and the other having morethan the intermediate amount which plays the part here that the healthydoes in the medical art and that good condition does in the art ofbodily training but still acting unjustly is the worse for it involvesvice and is blameworthyinvolves vice which is either of the completeand unqualified kind or almost so we must admit the latter alternativebecause not all voluntary unjust action implies injustice as a stateof character while being unjustly treated does not involve viceand injustice in oneself in itself then being unjustly treatedis less bad but there is nothing to prevent its being incidentallya greater evil but theory cares nothing for this it calls pleurisya more serious mischief than a stumble yet the latter may becomeincidentally the more serious if the fall due to it leads to yourbeing taken prisoner or put to death the enemy metaphorically and in virtue of a certain resemblance there is a justicenot indeed between a man and himself but between certain parts ofhim yet not every kind of justice but that of master and servantor that of husband and wife for these are the ratios in which thepart of the soul that has a rational principle stands to the irrationalpart and it is with a view to these parts that people also thinka man can be unjust to himself viz because these parts are liableto suffer something contrary to their respective desires there istherefore thought to be a mutual justice between them as between rulerand ruled let this be taken as our account of justice and the other ie theother moral virtues book vi since we have previously said that one ought to choose that whichis intermediate not the excess nor the defect and that the intermediateis determined by the dictates of the right rule let us discuss thenature of these dictates in all the states of character we have mentionedas in all other matters there is a mark to which the man who hasthe rule looks and heightens or relaxes his activity accordinglyand there is a standard which determines the mean states which wesay are intermediate between excess and defect being in accordancewith the right rule but such a statement though true is by no meansclear for not only here but in all other pursuits which are objectsof knowledge it is indeed true to say that we must not exert ourselvesnor relax our efforts too much nor too little but to an intermediateextent and as the right rule dictates but if a man had only thisknowledge he would be none the wiser eg we should not know whatsort of medicines to apply to our body if some one were to say allthose which the medical art prescribes and which agree with the practiceof one who possesses the art hence it is necessary with regard tothe states of the soul also not only that this true statement shouldbe made but also that it should be determined what is the right ruleand what is the standard that fixes it we divided the virtues of the soul and a said that some are virtuesof character and others of intellect now we have discussed in detailthe moral virtues with regard to the others let us express our viewas follows beginning with some remarks about the soul we said beforethat there are two parts of the soulthat which grasps a rule or rationalprinciple and the irrational let us now draw a similar distinctionwithin the part which grasps a rational principle and let it be assumedthat there are two parts which grasp a rational principleone by whichwe contemplate the kind of things whose originative causes are invariableand one by which we contemplate variable things for where objectsdiffer in kind the part of the soul answering to each of the two isdifferent in kind since it is in virtue of a certain likeness andkinship with their objects that they have the knowledge they havelet one of these parts be called the scientific and the other thecalculative for to deliberate and to calculate are the same thingbut no one deliberates about the invariable therefore the calculativeis one part of the faculty which grasps a rational principle we mustthen learn what is the best state of each of these two parts forthis is the virtue of each  the virtue of a thing is relative to its proper work now there arethree things in the soul which control action and truthsensationreason desire of these sensation originates no action this is plain from the factthat the lower animals have sensation but no share in actionwhat affirmation and negation are in thinking pursuit and avoidanceare in desire so that since moral virtue is a state of characterconcerned with choice and choice is deliberate desire thereforeboth the reasoning must be true and the desire right if the choiceis to be good and the latter must pursue just what the former assertsnow this kind of intellect and of truth is practical of the intellectwhich is contemplative not practical nor productive the good andthe bad state are truth and falsity respectively for this is thework of everything intellectual while of the part which is practicaland intellectual the good state is truth in agreement with right desirethe origin of actionits efficient not its final causeis choiceand that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an endthis is why choice cannot exist either without reason and intellector without a moral state for good action and its opposite cannotexist without a combination of intellect and character intellectitself however moves nothing but only the intellect which aimsat an end and is practical for this rules the productive intellectas well since every one who makes makes for an end and that whichis made is not an end in the unqualified sense but only an end ina particular relation and the end of a particular operationonlythat which is done is that for good action is an end and desireaims at this hence choice is either desiderative reason or ratiocinativedesire and such an origin of action is a man it is to be notedthat nothing that is past is an object of choice eg no one choosesto have sacked troy for no one deliberates about the past but aboutwhat is future and capable of being otherwise while what is pastis not capable of not having taken place hence agathon is right insaying for this alone is lacking even to god to make undone things thathave once been done the work of both the intellectual parts then is truth thereforethe states that are most strictly those in respect of which each ofthese parts will reach truth are the virtues of the two parts let us begin then from the beginning and discuss these states oncemore let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which the soulpossesses truth by way of affirmation or denial are five in numberie art scientific knowledge practical wisdom philosophic wisdomintuitive reason we do not include judgement and opinion becausein these we may be mistaken now what scientific knowledge is if we are to speak exactly and notfollow mere similarities is plain from what follows we all supposethat what we know is not even capable of being otherwise of thingscapable of being otherwise we do not know when they have passed outsideour observation whether they exist or not therefore the object ofscientific knowledge is of necessity therefore it is eternal forthings that are of necessity in the unqualified sense are all eternaland things that are eternal are ungenerated and imperishable againevery science is thought to be capable of being taught and its objectof being learned and all teaching starts from what is already knownas we maintain in the analytics also for it proceeds sometimes throughinduction and sometimes by syllogism now induction is the startingpointwhich knowledge even of the universal presupposes while syllogismproceeds from universals there are therefore startingpoints fromwhich syllogism proceeds which are not reached by syllogism it istherefore by induction that they are acquired scientific knowledgeis then a state of capacity to demonstrate and has the other limitingcharacteristics which we specify in the analytics for it is whena man believes in a certain way and the startingpoints are knownto him that he has scientific knowledge since if they are not betterknown to him than the conclusion he will have his knowledge onlyincidentally let this then be taken as our account of scientific knowledge in the variable are included both things made and things done makingand acting are different for their nature we treat even the discussionsoutside our school as reliable so that the reasoned state of capacityto act is different from the reasoned state of capacity to make hencetoo they are not included one in the other for neither is actingmaking nor is making acting now since architecture is an art andis essentially a reasoned state of capacity to make and there isneither any art that is not such a state nor any such state that isnot an art art is identical with a state of capacity to make involvinga true course of reasoning all art is concerned with coming intobeing ie with contriving and considering how something may comeinto being which is capable of either being or not being and whoseorigin is in the maker and not in the thing made for art is concernedneither with things that are or come into being by necessity norwith things that do so in accordance with nature since these havetheir origin in themselves making and acting being different artmust be a matter of making not of acting and in a sense chance andart are concerned with the same objects as agathon says art loveschance and chance loves art art then as has been is a state concernedwith making involving a true course of reasoning and lack of arton the contrary is a state concerned with making involving a falsecourse of reasoning both are concerned with the variable regarding practical wisdom we shall get at the truth by consideringwho are the persons we credit with it now it is thought to be themark of a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well aboutwhat is good and expedient for himself not in some particular respecteg about what sorts of thing conduce to health or to strength butabout what sorts of thing conduce to the good life in general thisis shown by the fact that we credit men with practical wisdom in someparticular respect when they have calculated well with a view to somegood end which is one of those that are not the object of any artit follows that in the general sense also the man who is capable ofdeliberating has practical wisdom now no one deliberates about thingsthat are invariable nor about things that it is impossible for himto do therefore since scientific knowledge involves demonstrationbut there is no demonstration of things whose first principles arevariable for all such things might actually be otherwise and sinceit is impossible to deliberate about things that are of necessitypractical wisdom cannot be scientific knowledge nor art not sciencebecause that which can be done is capable of being otherwise notart because action and making are different kinds of thing the remainingalternative then is that it is a true and reasoned state of capacityto act with regard to the things that are good or bad for man forwhile making has an end other than itself action cannot for goodaction itself is its end it is for this reason that we think periclesand men like him have practical wisdom viz because they can seewhat is good for themselves and what is good for men in general weconsider that those can do this who are good at managing householdsor states this is why we call temperance sophrosune by this namewe imply that it preserves ones practical wisdom sozousa tan phronsinnow what it preserves is a judgement of the kind we have describedfor it is not any and every judgement that pleasant and painful objectsdestroy and pervert eg the judgement that the triangle has or hasnot its angles equal to two right angles but only judgements aboutwhat is to be done for the originating causes of the things thatare done consist in the end at which they are aimed but the man whohas been ruined by pleasure or pain forthwith fails to see any suchoriginating causeto see that for the sake of this or because of thishe ought to choose and do whatever he chooses and does for vice isdestructive of the originating cause of action practical wisdomthen must be a reasoned and true state of capacity to act with regardto human goods but further while there is such a thing as excellencein art there is no such thing as excellence in practical wisdomand in art he who errs willingly is preferable but in practical wisdomas in the virtues he is the reverse plainly then practical wisdomis a virtue and not an art there being two parts of the soul thatcan follow a course of reasoning it must be the virtue of one ofthe two ie of that part which forms opinions for opinion is aboutthe variable and so is practical wisdom but yet it is not only areasoned state this is shown by the fact that a state of that sortmay forgotten but practical wisdom cannot  scientific knowledge is judgement about things that are universaland necessary and the conclusions of demonstration and all scientificknowledge follow from first principles for scientific knowledgeinvolves apprehension of a rational ground this being so the firstprinciple from which what is scientifically known follows cannot bean object of scientific knowledge of art or of practical wisdomfor that which can be scientifically known can be demonstrated andart and practical wisdom deal with things that are variable nor arethese first principles the objects of philosophic wisdom for it isa mark of the philosopher to have demonstration about some thingsif then the states of mind by which we have truth and are neverdeceived about things invariable or even variable are scientific knowlededgepractical wisdom philosophic wisdom and intuitive reason and itcannot be any of the three ie practical wisdom scientific knowledgeor philosophic wisdom the remaining alternative is that it is intuitivereason that grasps the first principles  wisdom  in the arts we ascribe to their most finished exponentseg to phidias as a sculptor and to polyclitus as a maker of portraitstatuesand here we mean nothing by wisdom except excellence in art but we think that some people are wise in general not in some particularfield or in any other limited respect as homer says in the margiteshim did the gods make neither a digger nor yet a ploughmannor wise in anything else therefore wisdom must plainly be the mostfinished of the forms of knowledge it follows that the wise man mustnot only know what follows from the first principles but must alsopossess truth about the first principles therefore wisdom must beintuitive reason combined with scientific knowledgescientific knowledgeof the highest objects which has received as it were its proper completionof the highest objects we say for it would be strange to think thatthe art of politics or practical wisdom is the best knowledge sinceman is not the best thing in the world now if what is healthy orgood is different for men and for fishes but what is white or straightis always the same any one would say that what is wise is the samebut what is practically wise is different for it is to that whichobserves well the various matters concerning itself that one ascribespractical wisdom and it is to this that one will entrust such mattersthis is why we say that some even of the lower animals have practicalwisdom viz those which are found to have a power of foresight withregard to their own life it is evident also that philosophic wisdomand the art of politics cannot be the same for if the state of mindconcerned with a mans own interests is to be called philosophic wisdomthere will be many philosophic wisdoms there will not be one concernedwith the good of all animals any more than there is one art of medicinefor all existing things but a different philosophic wisdom aboutthe good of each species but if the argument be that man is the best of the animals this makesno difference for there are other things much more divine in theirnature even than man eg most conspicuously the bodies of whichthe heavens are framed from what has been said it is plain thenthat philosophic wisdom is scientific knowledge combined with intuitivereason of the things that are highest by nature this is why we sayanaxagoras thales and men like them have philosophic but not practicalwisdom when we see them ignorant of what is to their own advantageand why we say that they know things that are remarkable admirabledifficult and divine but useless viz because it is not human goodsthat they seek practical wisdom on the other hand is concerned with things humanand things about which it is possible to deliberate for we say thisis above all the work of the man of practical wisdom to deliberatewell but no one deliberates about things invariable nor about thingswhich have not an end and that a good that can be brought about byaction the man who is without qualification good at deliberatingis the man who is capable of aiming in accordance with calculationat the best for man of things attainable by action nor is practicalwisdom concerned with universals onlyit must also recognize the particularsfor it is practical and practice is concerned with particulars thisis why some who do not know and especially those who have experienceare more practical than others who know for if a man knew that lightmeats are digestible and wholesome but did not know which sorts ofmeat are light he would not produce health but the man who knowsthat chicken is wholesome is more likely to produce healthnow practical wisdom is concerned with action therefore one shouldhave both forms of it or the latter in preference to the formerbut of practical as of philosophic wisdom there must be a controllingkind  political wisdom and practical wisdom are the same state of mindbut their essence is not the same of the wisdom concerned with thecity the practical wisdom which plays a controlling part is legislativewisdom while that which is related to this as particulars to theiruniversal is known by the general name political wisdom this hasto do with action and deliberation for a decree is a thing to becarried out in the form of an individual act this is why the exponentsof this art are alone said to take part in politics for these alonedo things as manual labourers do things practical wisdom also is identified especially with that form of itwhich is concerned with a man himselfwith the individual and thisis known by the general name practical wisdom of the other kindsone is called household management another legislation the thirdpolitics and of the latter one part is called deliberative and theother judicial now knowing what is good for oneself will be one kindof knowledge but it is very different from the other kinds and theman who knows and concerns himself with his own interests is thoughtto have practical wisdom while politicians are thought to be busybodieshence the word of euripides but how could i be wise who might at ease numbered among the armys multitude have had an equal share for those who aim too high and do too much those who think thus seektheir own good and consider that one ought to do so from this opinionthen has come the view that such men have practical wisdom yet perhapsones own good cannot exist without household management nor withouta form of government further how one should order ones own affairsis not clear and needs inquiry what has been said is confirmed by the fact that while young men becomegeometricians and mathematicians and wise in matters like these itis thought that a young man of practical wisdom cannot be found thecause is that such wisdom is concerned not only with universals butwith particulars which become familiar from experience but a youngman has no experience for it is length of time that gives experienceindeed one might ask this question too why a boy may become a mathematicianbut not a philosopher or a physicist it is because the objects ofmathematics exist by abstraction while the first principles of theseother subjects come from experience and because young men have noconviction about the latter but merely use the proper language whilethe essence of mathematical objects is plain enough to themfurther error in deliberation may be either about the universal orabout the particular we may fall to know either that all water thatweighs heavy is bad or that this particular water weighs heavythat practical wisdom is not scientific knowledge is evident forit is as has been said concerned with the ultimate particular factsince the thing to be done is of this nature it is opposed thento intuitive reason for intuitive reason is of the limiting premissesfor which no reason can be given while practical wisdom is concernedwith the ultimate particular which is the object not of scientificknowledge but of perceptionnot the perception of qualities peculiarto one sense but a perception akin to that by which we perceive thatthe particular figure before us is a triangle for in that directionas well as in that of the major premiss there will be a limit butthis is rather perception than practical wisdom though it is anotherkind of perception than that of the qualities peculiar to each sense there is a difference between inquiry and deliberation for deliberationis inquiry into a particular kind of thing we must grasp the natureof excellence in deliberation as well whether it is a form of scientificknowledge or opinion or skill in conjecture or some other kindof thing scientific knowledge it is not for men do not inquire aboutthe things they know about but good deliberation is a kind of deliberationand he who deliberates inquires and calculates nor is it skill inconjecture for this both involves no reasoning and is something thatis quick in its operation while men deliberate a long time and theysay that one should carry out quickly the conclusions of ones deliberationbut should deliberate slowly again readiness of mind is differentfrom excellence in deliberation it is a sort of skill in conjecturenor again is excellence in deliberation opinion of any sort but sincethe man who deliberates badly makes a mistake while he who deliberateswell does so correctly excellence in deliberation is clearly a kindof correctness but neither of knowledge nor of opinion for thereis no such thing as correctness of knowledge since there is no suchthing as error of knowledge and correctness of opinion is truthand at the same time everything that is an object of opinion is alreadydetermined but again excellence in deliberation involves reasoningthe remaining alternative then is that it is correctness of thinkingfor this is not yet assertion since while even opinion is not inquirybut has reached the stage of assertion the man who is deliberatingwhether he does so well or ill is searching for something and calculatingbut excellence in deliberation is a certain correctness of deliberationhence we must first inquire what deliberation is and what it is aboutand there being more than one kind of correctness plainly excellencein deliberation is not any and every kind for  the incontinentman and the bad man if he is clever will reach as a result of hiscalculation what he sets before himself so that he will have deliberatedcorrectly but he will have got for himself a great evil now to havedeliberated well is thought to be a good thing for it is this kindof correctness of deliberation that is excellence in deliberationviz that which tends to attain what is good but  it is possibleto attain even good by a false syllogism and to attain what one oughtto do but not by the right means the middle term being false sothat this too is not yet excellence in deliberation this state invirtue of which one attains what one ought but not by the right meansagain  it is possible to attain it by long deliberation while anotherman attains it quickly therefore in the former case we have not yetgot excellence in deliberation which is rightness with regard tothe expedientrightness in respect both of the end the manner andthe time  further it is possible to have deliberated well eitherin the unqualified sense or with reference to a particular end excellencein deliberation in the unqualified sense then is that which succeedswith reference to what is the end in the unqualified sense and excellencein deliberation in a particular sense is that which succeeds relativelyto a particular end if then it is characteristic of men of practicalwisdom to have deliberated well excellence in deliberation will becorrectness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practicalwisdom is the true apprehension  understanding also and goodness of understanding in virtue of whichmen are said to be men of understanding or of good understandingare neither entirely the same as opinion or scientific knowledge forat that rate all men would have been men of understanding nor arethey one of the particular sciences such as medicine the scienceof things connected with health or geometry the science of spatialmagnitudes for understanding is neither about things that are alwaysand are unchangeable nor about any and every one of the things thatcome into being but about things which may become subjects of questioningand deliberation hence it is about the same objects as practicalwisdom but understanding and practical wisdom are not the same forpractical wisdom issues commands since its end is what ought to bedone or not to be done but understanding only judges understandingis identical with goodness of understanding men of understandingwith men of good understanding now understanding is neither thehaving nor the acquiring of practical wisdom but as learning is calledunderstanding when it means the exercise of the faculty of knowledgeso understanding is applicable to the exercise of the faculty ofopinion for the purpose of judging of what some one else says aboutmatters with which practical wisdom is concernedand of judging soundlyfor well and soundly are the same thing and from this has comethe use of the name understanding in virtue of which men are saidto be of good understanding viz from the application of the wordto the grasping of scientific truth for we often call such graspingunderstanding  what is called judgement in virtue of which men are said to be sympatheticjudges and to have judgement is the right discrimination of theequitable this is shown by the fact that we say the equitable manis above all others a man of sympathetic judgement and identify equitywith sympathetic judgement about certain facts and sympathetic judgementis judgement which discriminates what is equitable and does so correctlyand correct judgement is that which judges what is truenow all the states we have considered converge as might be expectedto the same point for when we speak of judgement and understandingand practical wisdom and intuitive reason we credit the same peoplewith possessing judgement and having reached years of reason and withhaving practical wisdom and understanding for all these facultiesdeal with ultimates ie with particulars and being a man of understandingand of good or sympathetic judgement consists in being able judgeabout the things with which practical wisdom is concerned for theequities are common to all good men in relation to other men nowall things which have to be done are included among particulars orultimates for not only must the man of practical wisdom know particularfacts but understanding and judgement are also concerned with thingsto be done and these are ultimates and intuitive reason is concernedwith the ultimates in both directions for both the first terms andthe last are objects of intuitive reason and not of argument andthe intuitive reason which is presupposed by demonstrations graspsthe unchangeable and first terms while the intuitive reason involvedin practical reasonings grasps the last and variable fact ie theminor premiss for these variable facts are the startingpoints forthe apprehension of the end since the universals are reached fromthe particulars of these therefore we must have perception and thisperception is intuitive reason this is why these states are thought to be natural endowmentswhywhile no one is thought to be a philosopher by nature people arethought to have by nature judgement understanding and intuitivereason this is shown by the fact that we think our powers correspondto our time of life and that a particular age brings with it intuitivereason and judgement this implies that nature is the cause henceintuitive reason is both beginning and end for demonstrations arefrom these and about these therefore we ought to attend to the undemonstratedsayings and opinions of experienced and older people or of peopleof practical wisdom not less than to demonstrations for because experiencehas given them an eye they see aright we have stated then what practical and philosophic wisdom are andwith what each of them is concerned and we have said that each isthe virtue of a different part of the soul  difficulties might be raised as to the utility of these qualitiesof mind for  philosophic wisdom will contemplate none of the thingsthat will make a man happy for it is not concerned with any cominginto being and though practical wisdom has this merit for whatpurpose do we need it practical wisdom is the quality of mind concernedwith things just and noble and good for man but these are the thingswhich it is the mark of a good man to do and we are none the moreable to act for knowing them if the virtues are states of characterjust as we are none the better able to act for knowing the thingsthat are healthy and sound in the sense not of producing but of issuingfrom the state of health for we are none the more able to act forhaving the art of medicine or of gymnastics but  if we are tosay that a man should have practical wisdom not for the sake of knowingmoral truths but for the sake of becoming good practical wisdom willbe of no use to those who are good again it is of no use to thosewho have not virtue for it will make no difference whether they havepractical wisdom themselves or obey others who have it and it wouldbe enough for us to do what we do in the case of health though wewish to become healthy yet we do not learn the art of medicine besides this it would be thought strange if practical wisdom beinginferior to philosophic wisdom is to be put in authority over itas seems to be implied by the fact that the art which produces anythingrules and issues commands about that thing these then are the questions we must discuss so far we have onlystated the difficulties  now first let us say that in themselves these states must be worthyof choice because they are the virtues of the two parts of the soulrespectively even if neither of them produce anything  secondly they do produce something not as the art of medicineproduces health however but as health produces health so does philosophicwisdom produce happiness for being a part of virtue entire by beingpossessed and by actualizing itself it makes a man happy again the work of man is achieved only in accordance with practicalwisdom as well as with moral virtue for virtue makes us aim at theright mark and practical wisdom makes us take the right means ofthe fourth part of the soulthe nutritivethere is no such virtuefor there is nothing which it is in its power to do or not to do  with regard to our being none the more able to do because of ourpractical wisdom what is noble and just let us begin a little furtherback starting with the following principle as we say that some peoplewho do just acts are not necessarily just ie those who do the actsordained by the laws either unwillingly or owing to ignorance or forsome other reason and not for the sake of the acts themselves thoughto be sure they do what they should and all the things that the goodman ought so is it it seems that in order to be good one mustbe in a certain state when one does the several acts ie one mustdo them as a result of choice and for the sake of the acts themselvesnow virtue makes the choice right but the question of the thingswhich should naturally be done to carry out our choice belongs notto virtue but to another faculty we must devote our attention tothese matters and give a clearer statement about them there is afaculty which is called cleverness and this is such as to be ableto do the things that tend towards the mark we have set before ourselvesand to hit it now if the mark be noble the cleverness is laudablebut if the mark be bad the cleverness is mere smartness hence wecall even men of practical wisdom clever or smart practical wisdomis not the faculty but it does not exist without this faculty andthis eye of the soul acquires its formed state not without the aidof virtue as has been said and is plain for the syllogisms whichdeal with acts to be done are things which involve a startingpointviz since the end ie what is best is of such and such a naturewhatever it may be let it for the sake of argument be what we pleaseand this is not evident except to the good man for wickedness pervertsus and causes us to be deceived about the startingpoints of actiontherefore it is evident that it is impossible to be practically wisewithout being good  we must therefore consider virtue also once more for virtue too issimilarly related as practical wisdom is to clevernessnot the samebut like itso is natural virtue to virtue in the strict sense forall men think that each type of character belongs to its possessorsin some sense by nature for from the very moment of birth we arejust or fitted for selfcontrol or brave or have the other moral qualitiesbut yet we seek something else as that which is good in the strictsensewe seek for the presence of such qualities in another way forboth children and brutes have the natural dispositions to these qualitiesbut without reason these are evidently hurtful only we seem to seethis much that while one may be led astray by them as a strongbody which moves without sight may stumble badly because of its lackof sight still if a man once acquires reason that makes a differencein action and his state while still like what it was will thenbe virtue in the strict sense therefore as in the part of us whichforms opinions there are two types cleverness and practical wisdomso too in the moral part there are two types natural virtue and virtuein the strict sense and of these the latter involves practical wisdomthis is why some say that all the virtues are forms of practical wisdomand why socrates in one respect was on the right track while in anotherhe went astray in thinking that all the virtues were forms of practicalwisdom he was wrong but in saying they implied practical wisdom hewas right this is confirmed by the fact that even now all men whenthey define virtue after naming the state of character and its objectsadd that state which is in accordance with the right rule nowthe right rule is that which is in accordance with practical wisdomall men then seem somehow to divine that this kind of state is virtueviz that which is in accordance with practical wisdom but we mustgo a little further for it is not merely the state in accordancewith the right rule but the state that implies the presence of theright rule that is virtue and practical wisdom is a right rule aboutsuch matters socrates then thought the virtues were rules or rationalprinciples for he thought they were all of them forms of scientificknowledge while we think they involve a rational principleit is clear then from what has been said that it is not possibleto be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom nor practicallywise without moral virtue but in this way we may also refute thedialectical argument whereby it might be contended that the virtuesexist in separation from each other the same man it might be saidis not best equipped by nature for all the virtues so that he willhave already acquired one when he has not yet acquired another thisis possible in respect of the natural virtues but not in respectof those in respect of which a man is called without qualificationgood for with the presence of the one quality practical wisdomwill be given all the virtues and it is plain that even if it wereof no practical value we should have needed it because it is thevirtue of the part of us in question plain too that the choice willnot be right without practical wisdom any more than without virtuefor the one deter mines the end and the other makes us do the thingsthat lead to the end but again it is not supreme over philosophic wisdom ie over thesuperior part of us any more than the art of medicine is over healthfor it does not use it but provides for its coming into being itissues orders then for its sake but not to it further to maintainits supremacy would be like saying that the art of politics rulesthe gods because it issues orders about all the affairs of the statebook vii let us now make a fresh beginning and point out that of moral statesto be avoided there are three kindsvice incontinence brutishnessthe contraries of two of these are evidentone we call virtue theother continence to brutishness it would be most fitting to opposesuperhuman virtue a heroic and divine kind of virtue as homer hasrepresented priam saying of hector that he was very goodfor he seemed not he the child of a mortal man but as one that of gods seed cametherefore if as they say men become gods by excess of virtue ofthis kind must evidently be the state opposed to the brutish statefor as a brute has no vice or virtue so neither has a god his stateis higher than virtue and that of a brute is a different kind ofstate from vice now since it is rarely that a godlike man is foundto use the epithetof the spartans who when they admire any one highly call him a godlikemanso too the brutish type is rarely found among men it is foundchiefly among barbarians but some brutish qualities are also producedby disease or deformity and we also call by this evil name thosemen who go beyond all ordinary standards by reason of vice of thiskind of disposition however we must later make some mention whilewe have discussed vice before we must now discuss incontinence andsoftness or effeminacy and continence and endurance for we musttreat each of the two neither as identical with virtue or wickednessnor as a different genus we must as in all other cases set theobserved facts before us and after first discussing the difficultiesgo on to prove if possible the truth of all the common opinionsabout these affections of the mind or failing this of the greaternumber and the most authoritative for if we both refute the objectionsand leave the common opinions undisturbed we shall have proved thecase sufficiently now  both continence and endurance are thought to be included amongthings good and praiseworthy and both incontinence and soft nessamong things bad and blameworthy and the same man is thought to becontinent and ready to abide by the result of his calculations orincontinent and ready to abandon them and  the incontinent manknowing that what he does is bad does it as a result of passionwhile the continent man knowing that his appetites are bad refuseson account of his rational principle to follow them  the temperateman all men call continent and disposed to endurance while the continentman some maintain to be always temperate but others do not and somecall the selfindulgent man incontinent and the incontinent man selfindulgentindiscriminately while others distinguish them  the man of practicalwisdom they sometimes say cannot be incontinent while sometimesthey say that some who are practically wise and clever are incontinentagain  men are said to be incontinent even with respect to angerhonour and gainthese then are the things that are said now we may ask  how a man who judges rightly can behave incontinentlythat he should behave so when he has knowledge some say is impossiblefor it would be strangeso socrates thoughtif when knowledge wasin a man something else could master it and drag it about like a slavefor socrates was entirely opposed to the view in question holdingthat there is no such thing as incontinence no one he said whenhe judges acts against what he judges bestpeople act so only by reasonof ignorance now this view plainly contradicts the observed factsand we must inquire about what happens to such a man if he acts byreason of ignorance what is the manner of his ignorance for thatthe man who behaves incontinently does not before he gets into thisstate think he ought to act so is evident but there are some whoconcede certain of socrates contentions but not others that nothingis stronger than knowledge they admit but not that on one acts contraryto what has seemed to him the better course and therefore they saythat the incontinent man has not knowledge when he is mastered byhis pleasures but opinion but if it is opinion and not knowledgeif it is not a strong conviction that resists but a weak one as inmen who hesitate we sympathize with their failure to stand by suchconvictions against strong appetites but we do not sympathize withwickedness nor with any of the other blameworthy states is it thenpractical wisdom whose resistance is mastered that is the strongestof all states but this is absurd the same man will be at once practicallywise and incontinent but no one would say that it is the part ofa practically wise man to do willingly the basest acts besides ithas been shown before that the man of practical wisdom is one whowill act for he is a man concerned with the individual facts andwho has the other virtues  further if continence involves having strong and bad appetitesthe temperate man will not be continent nor the continent man temperatefor a temperate man will have neither excessive nor bad appetitesbut the continent man must for if the appetites are good the stateof character that restrains us from following them is bad so thatnot all continence will be good while if they are weak and not badthere is nothing admirable in resisting them and if they are weakand bad there is nothing great in resisting these either further if continence makes a man ready to stand by any and everyopinion it is bad ie if it makes him stand even by a false opinionand if incontinence makes a man apt to abandon any and every opinionthere will be a good incontinence of which sophocles neoptolemusin the philoctetes will be an instance for he is to be praised fornot standing by what odysseus persuaded him to do because he is painedat telling a lie  further the sophistic argument presents a difficulty the syllogismarising from mens wish to expose paradoxical results arising froman opponents view in order that they may be admired when they succeedis one that puts us in a difficulty for thought is bound fast whenit will not rest because the conclusion does not satisfy it and cannotadvance because it cannot refute the argument there is an argumentfrom which it follows that folly coupled with incontinence is virtuefor a man does the opposite of what he judges owing to incontinencebut judges what is good to be evil and something that he should notdo and consequence he will do what is good and not what is evil further he who on conviction does and pursues and chooses whatis pleasant would be thought to be better than one who does so asa result not of calculation but of incontinence for he is easierto cure since he may be persuaded to change his mind but to the incontinentman may be applied the proverb when water chokes what is one towash it down with if he had been persuaded of the rightness of whathe does he would have desisted when he was persuaded to change hismind but now he acts in spite of his being persuaded of somethingquite different  further if incontinence and continence are concerned with anyand every kind of object who is it that is incontinent in the unqualifiedsense no one has all the forms of incontinence but we say some peopleare incontinent without qualification  of some such kind are the difficulties that arise some of these pointsmust be refuted and the others left in possession of the field forthe solution of the difficulty is the discovery of the truth we must consider first then whether incontinent people act knowinglyor not and in what sense knowingly then  with what sorts of objectthe incontinent and the continent man may be said to be concernedie whether with any and every pleasure and pain or with certaindeterminate kinds and whether the continent man and the man of enduranceare the same or different and similarly with regard to the othermatters germane to this inquiry the startingpoint of our investigationis a the question whether the continent man and the incontinentare differentiated by their objects or by their attitude ie whetherthe incontinent man is incontinent simply by being concerned withsuch and such objects or instead by his attitude or instead ofthat by both these things b the second question is whether incontinenceand continence are concerned with any and every object or not theman who is incontinent in the unqualified sense is neither concernedwith any and every object but with precisely those with which theselfindulgent man is concerned nor is he characterized by beingsimply related to these for then his state would be the same as selfindulgencebut by being related to them in a certain way for the one is ledon in accordance with his own choice thinking that he ought alwaysto pursue the present pleasure while the other does not think sobut yet pursues it  as for the suggestion that it is true opinion and not knowledgeagainst which we act incontinently that makes no difference to theargument for some people when in a state of opinion do not hesitatebut think they know exactly if then the notion is that owing totheir weak conviction those who have opinion are more likely to actagainst their judgement than those who know we answer that thereneed be no difference between knowledge and opinion in this respectfor some men are no less convinced of what they think than othersof what they know as is shown by the of heraclitus but a sincewe use the word know in two senses for both the man who has knowledgebut is not using it and he who is using it are said to know it willmake a difference whether when a man does what he should not hehas the knowledge but is not exercising it or is exercising it forthe latter seems strange but not the former b further since there are two kinds of premisses there is nothingto prevent a mans having both premisses and acting against his knowledgeprovided that he is using only the universal premiss and not the particularfor it is particular acts that have to be done and there are alsotwo kinds of universal term one is predicable of the agent the otherof the object eg dry food is good for every man and i am aman or such and such food is dry but whether this food is suchand such of this the incontinent man either has not or is not exercisingthe knowledge there will then be firstly an enormous differencebetween these manners of knowing so that to know in one way whenwe act incontinently would not seem anything strange while to knowin the other way would be extraordinary and further c the possession of knowledge in another sense thanthose just named is something that happens to men for within thecase of having knowledge but not using it we see a difference of stateadmitting of the possibility of having knowledge in a sense and yetnot having it as in the instance of a man asleep mad or drunkbut now this is just the condition of men under the influence of passionsfor outbursts of anger and sexual appetites and some other such passionsit is evident actually alter our bodily condition and in some meneven produce fits of madness it is plain then that incontinentpeople must be said to be in a similar condition to men asleep mador drunk the fact that men use the language that flows from knowledgeproves nothing for even men under the influence of these passionsutter scientific proofs and verses of empedocles and those who havejust begun to learn a science can string together its phrases butdo not yet know it for it has to become part of themselves and thattakes time so that we must suppose that the use of language by menin an incontinent state means no more than its utterance by actorson the stage d again we may also view the cause as follows withreference to the facts of human nature the one opinion is universalthe other is concerned with the particular facts and here we cometo something within the sphere of perception when a single opinionresults from the two the soul must in one type of case affirm theconclusion while in the case of opinions concerned with productionit must immediately act eg if everything sweet ought to be tastedand this is sweet in the sense of being one of the particular sweetthings the man who can act and is not prevented must at the sametime actually act accordingly when then the universal opinionis present in us forbidding us to taste and there is also the opinionthat everything sweet is pleasant and that this is sweet nowthis is the opinion that is active and when appetite happens tobe present in us the one opinion bids us avoid the object but appetiteleads us towards it for it can move each of our bodily parts sothat it turns out that a man behaves incontinently under the influencein a sense of a rule and an opinion and of one not contrary initself but only incidentallyfor the appetite is contrary not theopinionto the right rule it also follows that this is the reasonwhy the lower animals are not incontinent viz because they haveno universal judgement but only imagination and memory of particularsthe explanation of how the ignorance is dissolved and the incontinentman regains his knowledge is the same as in the case of the man drunkor asleep and is not peculiar to this condition we must go to thestudents of natural science for it now the last premiss both beingan opinion about a perceptible object and being what determines ouractions this a man either has not when he is in the state of passionor has it in the sense in which having knowledge did not mean knowingbut only talking as a drunken man may utter the verses of empedoclesand because the last term is not universal nor equally an object ofscientific knowledge with the universal term the position that socratessought to establish actually seems to result for it is not in thepresence of what is thought to be knowledge proper that the affectionof incontinence arises nor is it this that is dragged about asa result of the state of passion but in that of perceptual knowledgethis must suffice as our answer to the question of action with andwithout knowledge and how it is possible to behave incontinentlywith knowledge   we must next discuss whether there is any one who is incontinentwithout qualification or all men who are incontinent are so in aparticular sense and if there is with what sort of objects he isconcerned that both continent persons and persons of endurance andincontinent and soft persons are concerned with pleasures and painsis evident now of the things that produce pleasure some are necessary whileothers are worthy of choice in themselves but admit of excess thebodily causes of pleasure being necessary by such i mean both thoseconcerned with food and those concerned with sexual intercourse iethe bodily matters with which we defined selfindulgence and temperanceas being concerned while the others are not necessary but worthyof choice in themselves eg victory honour wealth and good andpleasant things of this sort this being so a those who go toexcess with reference to the latter contrary to the right rule whichis in themselves are not called incontinent simply but incontinentwith the qualification in respect of money gain honour or angernotsimply incontinent on the ground that they are different from incontinentpeople and are called incontinent by reason of a resemblance comparethe case of anthropos man who won a contest at the olympic gamesin his case the general definition of man differed little from thedefinition peculiar to him but yet it was different this is shownby the fact that incontinence either without qualification or in respectof some particular bodily pleasure is blamed not only as a fault butas a kind of vice while none of the people who are incontinent inthese other respects is so blamed but b of the people who are incontinent with respect to bodily enjoymentswith which we say the temperate and the selfindulgent man are concernedhe who pursues the excesses of things pleasantand shuns those ofthings painful of hunger and thirst and heat and cold and all theobjects of touch and tastenot by choice but contrary to his choiceand his judgement is called incontinent not with the qualificationin respect of this or that eg of anger but just simply thisis confirmed by the fact that men are called soft with regard tothese pleasures but not with regard to any of the others and forthis reason we group together the incontinent and the selfindulgentthe continent and the temperate manbut not any of these other typesbecausethey are concerned somehow with the same pleasures and pains butthough these are concerned with the same objects they are not similarlyrelated to them but some of them make a deliberate choice while theothers do not this is why we should describe as selfindulgent rather the man whowithout appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excessesof pleasure and avoids moderate pains than the man who does so becauseof his strong appetites for what would the former do if he had inaddition a vigorous appetite and a violent pain at the lack of thenecessary objects now of appetites and pleasures some belong to the class of thingsgenerically noble and goodfor some pleasant things are by natureworthy of choice while others are contrary to these and others areintermediate to adopt our previous distinctioneg wealth gainvictory honour and with reference to all objects whether of thisor of the intermediate kind men are not blamed for being affectedby them for desiring and loving them but for doing so in a certainway ie for going to excess this is why all those who contraryto the rule either are mastered by or pursue one of the objects whichare naturally noble and good eg those who busy themselves morethan they ought about honour or about children and parents are notwicked for these too are good and those who busy themselves aboutthem are praised but yet there is an excess even in themif likeniobe one were to fight even against the gods or were to be as muchdevoted to ones father as satyrus nicknamed the filial who wasthought to be very silly on this point there is no wickedness thenwith regard to these objects for the reason named viz because eachof them is by nature a thing worthy of choice for its own sake yetexcesses in respect of them are bad and to be avoided similarly thereis no incontinence with regard to them for incontinence is not onlyto be avoided but is also a thing worthy of blame but owing to asimilarity in the state of feeling people apply the name incontinenceadding in each case what it is in respect of as we may describe asa bad doctor or a bad actor one whom we should not call bad simplyas then in this case we do not apply the term without qualificationbecause each of these conditions is no shadness but only analogousto it so it is clear that in the other case also that alone mustbe taken to be incontinence and continence which is concerned withthe same objects as temperance and selfindulgence but we apply theterm to anger by virtue of a resemblance and this is why we say witha qualification incontinent in respect of anger as we say incontinentin respect of honour or of gain   some things are pleasant by nature and of these a some areso without qualification and b others are so with reference toparticular classes either of animals or of men while  others arenot pleasant by nature but a some of them become so by reason ofinjuries to the system and b others by reason of acquired habitsand c others by reason of originally bad natures this being soit is possible with regard to each of the latter kinds to discoversimilar states of character to those recognized with regard to theformer i mean a the brutish states as in the case of the femalewho they say rips open pregnant women and devours the infants orof the things in which some of the tribes about the black sea thathave gone savage are said to delightin raw meat or in human fleshor in lending their children to one another to feast uponor of thestory told of phalaris these states are brutish but b others arise as a result of diseaseor in some cases of madness as with the man who sacrificed andate his mother or with the slave who ate the liver of his fellowand others are morbid states c resulting from custom eg the habitof plucking out the hair or of gnawing the nails or even coals orearth and in addition to these paederasty for these arise in someby nature and in others as in those who have been the victims oflust from childhood from habit now those in whom nature is the cause of such a state no one wouldcall incontinent any more than one would apply the epithet to womenbecause of the passive part they play in copulation nor would oneapply it to those who are in a morbid condition as a result of habitto have these various types of habit is beyond the limits of viceas brutishness is too for a man who has them to master or be masteredby them is not simple continence or incontinence but that whichis so by analogy as the man who is in this condition in respect offits of anger is to be called incontinent in respect of that feelingbut not incontinent simply for every excessive state whether of follyof cowardice of selfindulgence or of bad temper is either brutishor morbid the man who is by nature apt to fear everything even thesqueak of a mouse is cowardly with a brutish cowardice while theman who feared a weasel did so in consequence of disease and of foolishpeople those who by nature are thoughtless and live by their sensesalone are brutish like some races of the distant barbarians whilethose who are so as a result of disease eg of epilepsy or of madnessare morbid of these characteristics it is possible to have some onlyat times and not to be mastered by them eg phalaris may have restraineda desire to eat the flesh of a child or an appetite for unnaturalsexual pleasure but it is also possible to be mastered not merelyto have the feelings thus as the wickedness which is on the humanlevel is called wickedness simply while that which is not is calledwickedness not simply but with the qualification brutish or morbidin the same way it is plain that some incontinence is brutish andsome morbid while only that which corresponds to human selfindulgenceis incontinence simply that incontinence and continence then are concerned only with thesame objects as selfindulgence and temperance and that what is concernedwith other objects is a type distinct from incontinence and calledincontinence by a metaphor and not simply is plain  that incontinence in respect of anger is less disgraceful than thatin respect of the appetites is what we will now proceed to see anger seems to listen to argument to some extent but to mishear itas do hasty servants who run out before they have heard the wholeof what one says and then muddle the order or as dogs bark if thereis but a knock at the door before looking to see if it is a friendso anger by reason of the warmth and hastiness of its nature thoughit hears does not hear an order and springs to take revenge forargument or imagination informs us that we have been insulted or slightedand anger reasoning as it were that anything like this must be foughtagainst boils up straightway while appetite if argument or perceptionmerely says that an object is pleasant springs to the enjoyment ofit therefore anger obeys the argument in a sense but appetite doesnot it is therefore more disgraceful for the man who is incontinentin respect of anger is in a sense conquered by argument while theother is conquered by appetite and not by argument  further we pardon people more easily for following natural desiressince we pardon them more easily for following such appetites as arecommon to all men and in so far as they are common now anger andbad temper are more natural than the appetites for excess ie forunnecessary objects take for instance the man who defended himselfon the charge of striking his father by saying yes but he struckhis father and he struck his and pointing to his child thisboy will strike me when he is a man it runs in the family or theman who when he was being dragged along by his son bade him stop atthe doorway since he himself had dragged his father only as far asthat  further those who are more given to plotting against others aremore criminal now a passionate man is not given to plotting noris anger itselfit is open but the nature of appetite is illustratedby what the poets call aphrodite guileweaving daughter of cyprusand by homers words about her embroidered girdle and the whisper of wooing is there whose subtlety stealeth the wits of the wise how prudent soeertherefore if this form of incontinence is more criminal and disgracefulthan that in respect of anger it is both incontinence without qualificationand in a sense vice  further no one commits wanton outrage with a feeling of painbut every one who acts in anger acts with pain while the man whocommits outrage acts with pleasure if then those acts at whichit is most just to be angry are more criminal than others the incontinencewhich is due to appetite is the more criminal for there is no wantonoutrage involved in anger plainly then the incontinence concerned with appetite is more disgracefulthan that concerned with anger and continence and incontinence areconcerned with bodily appetites and pleasures but we must grasp thedifferences among the latter themselves for as has been said atthe beginning some are human and natural both in kind and in magnitudeothers are brutish and others are due to organic injuries and diseasesonly with the first of these are temperance and selfindulgence concernedthis is why we call the lower animals neither temperate nor selfindulgentexcept by a metaphor and only if some one race of animals exceedsanother as a whole in wantonness destructiveness and omnivorousgreed these have no power of choice or calculation but they aredepartures from the natural norm as among men madmen are now brutishnessis a less evil than vice though more alarming for it is not thatthe better part has been perverted as in manthey have no betterpart thus it is like comparing a lifeless thing with a living inrespect of badness for the badness of that which has no originativesource of movement is always less hurtful and reason is an originativesource thus it is like comparing injustice in the abstract with anunjust man each is in some sense worse for a bad man will do tenthousand times as much evil as a brute  with regard to the pleasures and pains and appetites and aversionsarising through touch and taste to which both selfindulgence andtemperance were formerly narrowed down it possible to be in sucha state as to be defeated even by those of them which most peoplemaster or to master even those by which most people are defeatedamong these possibilities those relating to pleasures are incontinenceand continence those relating to pains softness and endurance thestate of most people is intermediate even if they lean more towardsthe worse states now since some pleasures are necessary while others are not andare necessary up to a point while the excesses of them are not northe deficiencies and this is equally true of appetites and painsthe man who pursues the excesses of things pleasant or pursues toexcess necessary objects and does so by choice for their own sakeand not at all for the sake of any result distinct from them is selfindulgentfor such a man is of necessity unlikely to repent and therefore incurablesince a man who cannot repent cannot be cured the man who is deficientin his pursuit of them is the opposite of selfindulgent the manwho is intermediate is temperate similarly there is the man whoavoids bodily pains not because he is defeated by them but by choiceof those who do not choose such acts one kind of man is led to themas a result of the pleasure involved another because he avoids thepain arising from the appetite so that these types differ from oneanother now any one would think worse of a man with no appetite orwith weak appetite were he to do something disgraceful than if hedid it under the influence of powerful appetite and worse of himif he struck a blow not in anger than if he did it in anger for whatwould he have done if he had been strongly affected this is why theselfindulgent man is worse than the incontinent of the states namedthen the latter is rather a kind of softness the former is selfindulgencewhile to the incontinent man is opposed the continent to the softis opposed the man of endurance for endurance consists in resistingwhile continence consists in conquering and resisting and conqueringare different as not being beaten is different from winning thisis why continence is also more worthy of choice than endurance nowthe man who is defective in respect of resistance to the things whichmost men both resist and resist successfully is soft and effeminatefor effeminacy too is a kind of softness such a man trails his cloakto avoid the pain of lifting it and plays the invalid without thinkinghimself wretched though the man he imitates is a wretched manthe case is similar with regard to continence and incontinence forif a man is defeated by violent and excessive pleasures or painsthere is nothing wonderful in that indeed we are ready to pardonhim if he has resisted as theodectes philoctetes does when bittenby the snake or carcinus cercyon in the alope and as people whotry to restrain their laughter burst out into a guffaw as happenedto xenophantus but it is surprising if a man is defeated by and cannotresist pleasures or pains which most men can hold out against whenthis is not due to heredity or disease like the softness that ishereditary with the kings of the scythians or that which distinguishesthe female sex from the male the lover of amusement too is thought to be selfindulgent butis really soft for amusement is a relaxation since it is a restfrom work and the lover of amusement is one of the people who goto excess in this of incontinence one kind is impetuosity another weakness for somemen after deliberating fail owing to their emotion to stand by theconclusions of their deliberation others because they have not deliberatedare led by their emotion since some men just as people who firsttickle others are not tickled themselves if they have first perceivedand seen what is coming and have first roused themselves and theircalculative faculty are not defeated by their emotion whether itbe pleasant or painful it is keen and excitable people that sufferespecially from the impetuous form of incontinence for the formerby reason of their quickness and the latter by reason of the violenceof their passions do not await the argument because they are aptto follow their imagination  the selfindulgent man as was said is not apt to repent for hestands by his choice but incontinent man is likely to repent thisis why the position is not as it was expressed in the formulationof the problem but the selfindulgent man is incurable and the incontinentman curable for wickedness is like a disease such as dropsy or consumptionwhile incontinence is like epilepsy the former is a permanent thelatter an intermittent badness and generally incontinence and viceare different in kind vice is unconscious of itself incontinenceis not of incontinent men themselves those who become temporarilybeside themselves are better than those who have the rational principlebut do not abide by it since the latter are defeated by a weakerpassion and do not act without previous deliberation like the othersfor the incontinent man is like the people who get drunk quickly andon little wine ie on less than most people evidently then incontinence is not vice though perhaps it is soin a qualified sense for incontinence is contrary to choice whilevice is in accordance with choice not but what they are similar inrespect of the actions they lead to as in the saying of demodocusabout the milesians the milesians are not without sense but theydo the things that senseless people do so too incontinent peopleare not criminal but they will do criminal acts now since the incontinent man is apt to pursue not on convictionbodily pleasures that are excessive and contrary to the right rulewhile the selfindulgent man is convinced because he is the sort ofman to pursue them it is on the contrary the former that is easilypersuaded to change his mind while the latter is not for virtueand vice respectively preserve and destroy the first principle andin actions the final cause is the first principle as the hypothesesare in mathematics neither in that case is it argument that teachesthe first principles nor is it so herevirtue either natural or producedby habituation is what teaches right opinion about the first principlesuch a man as this then is temperate his contrary is the selfindulgentbut there is a sort of man who is carried away as a result of passionand contrary to the right rulea man whom passion masters so thathe does not act according to the right rule but does not master tothe extent of making him ready to believe that he ought to pursuesuch pleasures without reserve this is the incontinent man who isbetter than the selfindulgent man and not bad without qualificationfor the best thing in him the first principle is preserved andcontrary to him is another kind of man he who abides by his convictionsand is not carried away at least as a result of passion it is evidentfrom these considerations that the latter is a good state and theformer a bad one  is the man continent who abides by any and every rule and any andevery choice or the man who abides by the right choice and is heincontinent who abandons any and every choice and any and every ruleor he who abandons the rule that is not false and the choice thatis right this is how we put it before in our statement of the problemor is it incidentally any and every choice but per se the true ruleand the right choice by which the one abides and the other does notif any one chooses or pursues this for the sake of that per se hepursues and chooses the latter but incidentally the former but whenwe speak without qualification we mean what is per se therefore ina sense the one abides by and the other abandons any and every opinionbut without qualification the true opinion there are some who are apt to abide by their opinion who are calledstrongheaded viz those who are hard to persuade in the first instanceand are not easily persuaded to change these have in them somethinglike the continent man as the prodigal is in a way like the liberalman and the rash man like the confident man but they are differentin many respects for it is to passion and appetite that the one willnot yield since on occasion the continent man will be easy to persuadebut it is to argument that the others refuse to yield for they doform appetites and many of them are led by their pleasures now thepeople who are strongheaded are the opinionated the ignorant andthe boorishthe opinionated being influenced by pleasure and painfor they delight in the victory they gain if they are not persuadedto change and are pained if their decisions become null and voidas decrees sometimes do so that they are liker the incontinent thanthe continent man but there are some who fail to abide by their resolutions not asa result of incontinence eg neoptolemus in sophocles philoctetesyet it was for the sake of pleasure that he did not stand fastbuta noble pleasure for telling the truth was noble to him but he hadbeen persuaded by odysseus to tell the lie for not every one whodoes anything for the sake of pleasure is either selfindulgent orbad or incontinent but he who does it for a disgraceful pleasuresince there is also a sort of man who takes less delight than he shouldin bodily things and does not abide by the rule he who is intermediatebetween him and the incontinent man is the continent man for theincontinent man fails to abide by the rule because he delights toomuch in them and this man because he delights in them too littlewhile the continent man abides by the rule and does not change oneither account now if continence is good both the contrary statesmust be bad as they actually appear to be but because the otherextreme is seen in few people and seldom as temperance is thoughtto be contrary only to selfindulgence so is continence to incontinencesince many names are applied analogically it is by analogy that wehave come to speak of the continence the temperate man for boththe continent man and the temperate man are such as to do nothingcontrary to the rule for the sake of the bodily pleasures but theformer has and the latter has not bad appetites and the latter issuch as not to feel pleasure contrary to the rule while the formeris such as to feel pleasure but not to be led by it and the incontinentand the selfindulgent man are also like another they are differentbut both pursue bodily pleasures the latter however also thinkingthat he ought to do so while the former does not think this nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent forit has been shown that a man is at the same time practically wiseand good in respect of character further a man has practical wisdomnot by knowing only but by being able to act but the incontinentman is unable to actthere is however nothing to prevent a cleverman from being incontinent this is why it is sometimes actually thoughtthat some people have practical wisdom but are incontinent viz becausecleverness and practical wisdom differ in the way we have describedin our first discussions and are near together in respect of theirreasoning but differ in respect of their purposenor yet is the incontinentman like the man who knows and is contemplating a truth but likethe man who is asleep or drunk and he acts willingly for he actsin a sense with knowledge both of what he does and of the end to whichhe does it but is not wicked since his purpose is good so thathe is halfwicked and he is not a criminal for he does not act ofmalice aforethought of the two types of incontinent man the one doesnot abide by the conclusions of his deliberation while the excitableman does not deliberate at all and thus the incontinent man likea city which passes all the right decrees and has good laws but makesno use of them as in anaxandrides jesting remark the city willed it that cares nought for laws but the wicked manis like a city that uses its laws but has wicked laws to usenow incontinence and continence are concerned with that which is inexcess of the state characteristic of most men for the continentman abides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less thanmost men can of the forms of incontinence that of excitable people is more curablethan that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their decisionsand those who are incontinent through habituation are more curablethan those in whom incontinence is innate for it is easier to changea habit than to change ones nature even habit is hard to changejust because it is like nature as evenus says i say that habits but a long practice friend and this becomes mens nature in the end we have now stated what continence incontinence endurance and softnessare and how these states are related to each other  the study of pleasure and pain belongs to the province of the politicalphilosopher for he is the architect of the end with a view to whichwe call one thing bad and another good without qualification furtherit is one of our necessary tasks to consider them for not only didwe lay it down that moral virtue and vice are concerned with painsand pleasures but most people say that happiness involves pleasurethis is why the blessed man is called by a name derived from a wordmeaning enjoyment now  some people think that no pleasure is a good either in itselfor incidentally since the good and pleasure are not the same others think that some pleasures are good but that most are bad again there is a third view that even if all pleasures are goodyet the best thing in the world cannot be pleasure  the reasonsgiven for the view that pleasure is not a good at all are a thatevery pleasure is a perceptible process to a natural state and thatno process is of the same kind as its end eg no process of buildingof the same kind as a house b a temperate man avoids pleasuresc a man of practical wisdom pursues what is free from pain notwhat is pleasant d the pleasures are a hindrance to thought andthe more so the more one delights in them eg in sexual pleasurefor no one could think of anything while absorbed in this e thereis no art of pleasure but every good is the product of some artf children and the brutes pursue pleasures  the reasons forthe view that not all pleasures are good are that a there are pleasuresthat are actually base and objects of reproach and b there areharmful pleasures for some pleasant things are unhealthy  thereason for the view that the best thing in the world is not pleasureis that pleasure is not an end but a process  these are pretty much the things that are said that it does not followfrom these grounds that pleasure is not a good or even the chiefgood is plain from the following considerations a a first sincethat which is good may be so in either of two senses one thing goodsimply and another good for a particular person natural constitutionsand states of being and therefore also the corresponding movementsand processes will be correspondingly divisible of those which arethought to be bad some will be bad if taken without qualificationbut not bad for a particular person but worthy of his choice andsome will not be worthy of choice even for a particular person butonly at a particular time and for a short period though not withoutqualification while others are not even pleasures but seem to beso viz all those which involve pain and whose end is curative egthe processes that go on in sick persons b further one kind of good being activity and another being statethe processes that restore us to our natural state are only incidentallypleasant for that matter the activity at work in the appetites forthem is the activity of so much of our state and nature as has remainedunimpaired for there are actually pleasures that involve no painor appetite eg those of contemplation the nature in such a casenot being defective at all that the others are incidental is indicatedby the fact that men do not enjoy the same pleasant objects when theirnature is in its settled state as they do when it is being replenishedbut in the former case they enjoy the things that are pleasant withoutqualification in the latter the contraries of these as well forthen they enjoy even sharp and bitter things none of which is pleasanteither by nature or without qualification the states they producetherefore are not pleasures naturally or without qualification foras pleasant things differ so do the pleasures arising from themc again it is not necessary that there should be something elsebetter than pleasure as some say the end is better than the processfor leasures are not processes nor do they all involve processtheyare activities and ends nor do they arise when we are becoming somethingbut when we are exercising some faculty and not all pleasures havean end different from themselves but only the pleasures of personswho are being led to the perfecting of their nature this is why itis not right to say that pleasure is perceptible process but it shouldrather be called activity of the natural state and instead of perceptibleunimpeded it is thought by some people to be process just becausethey think it is in the strict sense good for they think that activityis process which it is not b the view that pleasures are bad because some pleasant things areunhealthy is like saying that healthy things are bad because somehealthy things are bad for moneymaking both are bad in the respectmentioned but they are not bad for that reasonindeed thinking itselfis sometimes injurious to health neither practical wisdom nor any state of being is impeded by thepleasure arising from it it is foreign pleasures that impede forthe pleasures arising from thinking and learning will make us thinkand learn all the more c the fact that no pleasure is the product of any art arises naturallyenough there is no art of any other activity either but only ofthe corresponding faculty though for that matter the arts of theperfumer and the cook are thought to be arts of pleasured the arguments based on the grounds that the temperate man avoidspleasure and that the man of practical wisdom pursues the painlesslife and that children and the brutes pursue pleasure are all refutedby the same consideration we have pointed out in what sense pleasuresare good without qualification and in what sense some are not goodnow both the brutes and children pursue pleasures of the latter kindand the man of practical wisdom pursues tranquil freedom from thatkind viz those which imply appetite and pain ie the bodily pleasuresfor it is these that are of this nature and the excesses of themin respect of which the selfindulgent man is selfindulent thisis why the temperate man avoids these pleasures for even he has pleasuresof his own  but further e it is agreed that pain is bad and to be avoided forsome pain is without qualification bad and other pain is bad becauseit is in some respect an impediment to us now the contrary of thatwhich is to be avoided qua something to be avoided and bad is goodpleasure then is necessarily a good for the answer of speusippusthat pleasure is contrary both to pain and to good as the greateris contrary both to the less and to the equal is not successfulsince he would not say that pleasure is essentially just a speciesof evil and f if certain pleasures are bad that does not prevent the chiefgood from being some pleasure just as the chief good may be someform of knowledge though certain kinds of knowledge are bad perhapsit is even necessary if each disposition has unimpeded activitiesthat whether the activity if unimpeded of all our dispositionsor that of some one of them is happiness this should be the thingmost worthy of our choice and this activity is pleasure thus thechief good would be some pleasure though most pleasures might perhapsbe bad without qualification and for this reason all men think thatthe happy life is pleasant and weave pleasure into their ideal ofhappinessand reasonably too for no activity is perfect when it isimpeded and happiness is a perfect thing this is why the happy manneeds the goods of the body and external goods ie those of fortuneviz in order that he may not be impeded in these ways those whosay that the victim on the rack or the man who falls into great misfortunesis happy if he is good are whether they mean to or not talkingnonsense now because we need fortune as well as other things somepeople think good fortune the same thing as happiness but it is notthat for even good fortune itself when in excess is an impedimentand perhaps should then be no longer called good fortune for itslimit is fixed by reference to happiness and indeed the fact that all things both brutes and men pursue pleasureis an indication of its being somehow the chief good no voice is wholly lost that many peoples but since no one natureor state either is or is thought the best for all neither do allpursue the same pleasure yet all pursue pleasure and perhaps theyactually pursue not the pleasure they think they pursue nor that whichthey would say they pursue but the same pleasure for all thingshave by nature something divine in them but the bodily pleasureshave appropriated the name both because we oftenest steer our coursefor them and because all men share in them thus because they aloneare familiar men think there are no others it is evident also that if pleasure ie the activity of our facultiesis not a good it will not be the case that the happy man lives apleasant life for to what end should he need pleasure if it is nota good but the happy man may even live a painful life for pain isneither an evil nor a good if pleasure is not why then should heavoid it therefore too the life of the good man will not be pleasanterthan that of any one else if his activities are not more pleasant g with regard to the bodily pleasures those who say that some pleasuresare very much to be chosen viz the noble pleasures but not thebodily pleasures ie those with which the selfindulgent man isconcerned must consider why then the contrary pains are bad forthe contrary of bad is good are the necessary pleasures good in thesense in which even that which is not bad is good or are they goodup to a point is it that where you have states and processes of whichthere cannot be too much there cannot be too much of the correspondingpleasure and that where there can be too much of the one there canbe too much of the other also now there can be too much of bodilygoods and the bad man is bad by virtue of pursuing the excess notby virtue of pursuing the necessary pleasures for all men enjoy insome way or other both dainty foods and wines and sexual intercoursebut not all men do so as they ought the contrary is the case withpain for he does not avoid the excess of it he avoids it altogetherand this is peculiar to him for the alternative to excess of pleasureis not pain except to the man who pursues this excess since we should state not only the truth but also the cause of errorforthis contributes towards producing conviction since when a reasonableexplanation is given of why the false view appears true this tendsto produce belief in the true viewtherefore we must state why thebodily pleasures appear the more worthy of choice a firstly thenit is because they expel pain owing to the excesses of pain thatmen experience they pursue excessive and in general bodily pleasureas being a cure for the pain now curative agencies produce intensefeelingwhich is the reason why they are pursuedbecause they showup against the contrary pain indeed pleasure is thought not to begood for these two reasons as has been said viz that a some ofthem are activities belonging to a bad natureeither congenital asin the case of a brute or due to habit ie those of bad men whileb others are meant to cure a defective nature and it is betterto be in a healthy state than to be getting into it but these ariseduring the process of being made perfect and are therefore only incidentallygood b further they are pursued because of their violence bythose who cannot enjoy other pleasures at all events they go outof their way to manufacture thirsts somehow for themselves when theseare harmless the practice is irreproachable when they are hurtfulit is bad for they have nothing else to enjoy and besides a neutralstate is painful to many people because of their nature for the animalnature is always in travail as the students of natural science alsotestify saying that sight and hearing are painful but we have becomeused to this as they maintain similarly while in youth peopleare owing to the growth that is going on in a situation like thatof drunken men and youth is pleasant on the other hand people ofexcitable nature always need relief for even their body is ever intorment owing to its special composition and they are always underthe influence of violent desire but pain is driven out both by thecontrary pleasure and by any chance pleasure if it be strong andfor these reasons they become selfindulgent and bad but the pleasuresthat do not involve pains do not admit of excess and these are amongthe things pleasant by nature and not incidentally by things pleasantincidentally i mean those that act as cures for because as a resultpeople are cured through some action of the part that remains healthyfor this reason the process is thought pleasant by things naturallypleasant i mean those that stimulate the action of the healthy naturethere is no one thing that is always pleasant because our natureis not simple but there is another element in us as well inasmuchas we are perishable creatures so that if the one element does somethingthis is unnatural to the other nature and when the two elements areevenly balanced what is done seems neither painful nor pleasantfor if the nature of anything were simple the same action would alwaysbe most pleasant to it this is why god always enjoys a single andsimple pleasure for there is not only an activity of movement butan activity of immobility and pleasure is found more in rest thanin movement but change in all things is sweet as the poet saysbecause of some vice for as it is the vicious man that is changeableso the nature that needs change is vicious for it is not simple norgood we have now discussed continence and incontinence and pleasure andpain both what each is and in what sense some of them are good andothers bad it remains to speak of friendship book viii after what we have said a discussion of friendship would naturallyfollow since it is a virtue or implies virtue and is besides mostnecessary with a view to living for without friends no one wouldchoose to live though he had all other goods even rich men and thosein possession of office and of dominating power are thought to needfriends most of all for what is the use of such prosperity withoutthe opportunity of beneficence which is exercised chiefly and inits most laudable form towards friends or how can prosperity be guardedand preserved without friends the greater it is the more exposedis it to risk and in poverty and in other misfortunes men think friendsare the only refuge it helps the young too to keep from errorit aids older people by ministering to their needs and supplementingthe activities that are failing from weakness those in the primeof life it stimulates to noble actionstwo going togetherfor withfriends men are more able both to think and to act again parentseems by nature to feel it for offspring and offspring for parentnot only among men but among birds and among most animals it is feltmutually by members of the same race and especially by men whencewe praise lovers of their fellowmen we may even in our travels hownear and dear every man is to every other friendship seems too tohold states together and lawgivers to care more for it than for justicefor unanimity seems to be something like friendship and this theyaim at most of all and expel faction as their worst enemy and whenmen are friends they have no need of justice while when they arejust they need friendship as well and the truest form of justiceis thought to be a friendly quality but it is not only necessary but also noble for we praise those wholove their friends and it is thought to be a fine thing to have manyfriends and again we think it is the same people that are good menand are friends not a few things about friendship are matters of debate some defineit as a kind of likeness and say like people are friends whence comethe sayings like to like birds of a feather flock together andso on others on the contrary say two of a trade never agree onthis very question they inquire for deeper and more physical causeseuripides saying that parched earth loves the rain and stately heavenwhen filled with rain loves to fall to earth and heraclitus thatit is what opposes that helps and from different tones comes thefairest tune and all things are produced through strife whileempedocles as well as others expresses the opposite view that likeaims at like the physical problems we may leave alone for they donot belong to the present inquiry let us examine those which arehuman and involve character and feeling eg whether friendship canarise between any two people or people cannot be friends if they arewicked and whether there is one species of friendship or more thanone those who think there is only one because it admits of degreeshave relied on an inadequate indication for even things differentin species admit of degree we have discussed this matter previously the kinds of friendship may perhaps be cleared up if we first cometo know the object of love for not everything seems to be loved butonly the lovable and this is good pleasant or useful but it wouldseem to be that by which some good or pleasure is produced that isuseful so that it is the good and the useful that are lovable asends do men love then the good or what is good for them thesesometimes clash so too with regard to the pleasant now it is thoughtthat each loves what is good for himself and that the good is withoutqualification lovable and what is good for each man is lovable forhim but each man loves not what is good for him but what seems goodthis however will make no difference we shall just have to say thatthis is that which seems lovable now there are three grounds onwhich people love of the love of lifeless objects we do not use theword friendship for it is not mutual love nor is there a wishingof good to the other for it would surely be ridiculous to wish winewell if one wishes anything for it it is that it may keep so thatone may have it oneself but to a friend we say we ought to wishwhat is good for his sake but to those who thus wish good we ascribeonly goodwill if the wish is not reciprocated goodwill when it isreciprocal being friendship or must we add when it is recognizedfor many people have goodwill to those whom they have not seen butjudge to be good or useful and one of these might return this feelingthese people seem to bear goodwill to each other but how could onecall them friends when they do not know their mutual feelings tobe friends then the must be mutually recognized as bearing goodwilland wishing well to each other for one of the aforesaid reasons now these reasons differ from each other in kind so therefore dothe corresponding forms of love and friendship there are thereforethree kinds of friendship equal in number to the things that arelovable for with respect to each there is a mutual and recognizedlove and those who love each other wish well to each other in thatrespect in which they love one another now those who love each otherfor their utility do not love each other for themselves but in virtueof some good which they get from each other so too with those wholove for the sake of pleasure it is not for their character thatmen love readywitted people but because they find them pleasanttherefore those who love for the sake of utility love for the sakeof what is good for themselves and those who love for the sake ofpleasure do so for the sake of what is pleasant to themselves andnot in so far as the other is the person loved but in so far as heis useful or pleasant and thus these friendships are only incidentalfor it is not as being the man he is that the loved person is lovedbut as providing some good or pleasure such friendships then areeasily dissolved if the parties do not remain like themselves forif the one party is no longer pleasant or useful the other ceasesto love him now the useful is not permanent but is always changing thus whenthe motive of the friendship is done away the friendship is dissolvedinasmuch as it existed only for the ends in question this kind offriendship seems to exist chiefly between old people for at thatage people pursue not the pleasant but the useful and of those whoare in their prime or young between those who pursue utility andsuch people do not live much with each other either for sometimesthey do not even find each other pleasant therefore they do not needsuch companionship unless they are useful to each other for theyare pleasant to each other only in so far as they rouse in each otherhopes of something good to come among such friendships people alsoclass the friendship of a host and guest on the other hand the friendshipof young people seems to aim at pleasure for they live under theguidance of emotion and pursue above all what is pleasant to themselvesand what is immediately before them but with increasing age theirpleasures become different this is why they quickly become friendsand quickly cease to be so their friendship changes with the objectthat is found pleasant and such pleasure alters quickly young peopleare amorous too for the greater part of the friendship of love dependson emotion and aims at pleasure this is why they fall in love andquickly fall out of love changing often within a single day butthese people do wish to spend their days and lives together for itis thus that they attain the purpose of their friendshipperfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good and alikein virtue for these wish well alike to each other qua good and theyare good themselves now those who wish well to their friends fortheir sake are most truly friends for they do this by reason of ownnature and not incidentally therefore their friendship lasts as longas they are goodand goodness is an enduring thing and each is goodwithout qualification and to his friend for the good are both goodwithout qualification and useful to each other so too they are pleasantfor the good are pleasant both without qualification and to each othersince to each his own activities and others like them are pleasurableand the actions of the good are the same or like and such a friendshipis as might be expected permanent since there meet in it all thequalities that friends should have for all friendship is for thesake of good or of pleasuregood or pleasure either in the abstractor such as will be enjoyed by him who has the friendly feelingandis based on a certain resemblance and to a friendship of good menall the qualities we have named belong in virtue of the nature ofthe friends themselves for in the case of this kind of friendshipthe other qualities also are alike in both friends and that whichis good without qualification is also without qualification pleasantand these are the most lovable qualities love and friendship thereforeare found most and in their best form between such men but it is natural that such friendships should be infrequent forsuch men are rare further such friendship requires time and familiarityas the proverb says men cannot know each other till they have eatensalt together nor can they admit each other to friendship or befriends till each has been found lovable and been trusted by eachthose who quickly show the marks of friendship to each other wishto be friends but are not friends unless they both are lovable andknow the fact for a wish for friendship may arise quickly but friendshipdoes not  this kind of friendship then is perfect both in respect of durationand in all other respects and in it each gets from each in all respectsthe same as or something like what he gives which is what oughtto happen between friends friendship for the sake of pleasure bearsa resemblance to this kind for good people too are pleasant to eachother so too does friendship for the sake of utility for the goodare also useful to each other among men of these inferior sorts toofriendships are most permanent when the friends get the same thingfrom each other eg pleasure and not only that but also from thesame source as happens between readywitted people not as happensbetween lover and beloved for these do not take pleasure in the samethings but the one in seeing the beloved and the other in receivingattentions from his lover and when the bloom of youth is passingthe friendship sometimes passes too for the one finds no pleasurein the sight of the other and the other gets no attentions from thefirst but many lovers on the other hand are constant if familiarityhas led them to love each others characters these being alike butthose who exchange not pleasure but utility in their amour are bothless truly friends and less constant those who are friends for thesake of utility part when the advantage is at an end for they werelovers not of each other but of profit for the sake of pleasure or utility then even bad men may be friendsof each other or good men of bad or one who is neither good norbad may be a friend to any sort of person but for their own sakeclearly only good men can be friends for bad men do not delight ineach other unless some advantage come of the relation the friendship of the good too and this alone is proof against slanderfor it is not easy to trust any one talk about a man who has longbeen tested by oneself and it is among good men that trust and thefeeling that he would never wrong me and all the other things thatare demanded in true friendship are found in the other kinds of friendshiphowever there is nothing to prevent these evils arising for menapply the name of friends even to those whose motive is utility inwhich sense states are said to be friendly for the alliances of statesseem to aim at advantage and to those who love each other for thesake of pleasure in which sense children are called friends thereforewe too ought perhaps to call such people friends and say that thereare several kinds of friendshipfirstly and in the proper sense thatof good men qua good and by analogy the other kinds for it is invirtue of something good and something akin to what is found in truefriendship that they are friends since even the pleasant is goodfor the lovers of pleasure but these two kinds of friendship arenot often united nor do the same people become friends for the sakeof utility and of pleasure for things that are only incidentallyconnected are not often coupled together friendship being divided into these kinds bad men will be friendsfor the sake of pleasure or of utility being in this respect likeeach other but good men will be friends for their own sake iein virtue of their goodness these then are friends without qualificationthe others are friends incidentally and through a resemblance to these as in regard to the virtues some men are called good in respect ofa state of character others in respect of an activity so too inthe case of friendship for those who live together delight in eachother and confer benefits on each other but those who are asleepor locally separated are not performing but are disposed to performthe activities of friendship distance does not break off the friendshipabsolutely but only the activity of it but if the absence is lastingit seems actually to make men forget their friendship hence the sayingout of sight out of mind neither old people nor sour people seemto make friends easily for there is little that is pleasant in themand no one can spend his days with one whose company is painful ornot pleasant since nature seems above all to avoid the painful andto aim at the pleasant those however who approve of each otherbut do not live together seem to be welldisposed rather than actualfriends for there is nothing so characteristic of friends as livingtogether since while it people who are in need that desire benefitseven those who are supremely happy desire to spend their days togetherfor solitude suits such people least of all but people cannot livetogether if they are not pleasant and do not enjoy the same thingsas friends who are companions seem to do the truest friendship then is that of the good as we have frequentlysaid for that which is without qualification good or pleasant seemsto be lovable and desirable and for each person that which is goodor pleasant to him and the good man is lovable and desirable to thegood man for both these reasons now it looks as if love were a feelingfriendship a state of character for love may be felt just as muchtowards lifeless things but mutual love involves choice and choicesprings from a state of character and men wish well to those whomthey love for their sake not as a result of feeling but as a resultof a state of character and in loving a friend men love what is goodfor themselves for the good man in becoming a friend becomes a goodto his friend each then both loves what is good for himself andmakes an equal return in goodwill and in pleasantness for friendshipis said to be equality and both of these are found most in the friendshipof the good  between sour and elderly people friendship arises less readily inasmuchas they are less goodtempered and enjoy companionship less for theseare thou to be the greatest marks of friendship productive of itthis is why while men become friends quickly old men do not itis because men do not become friends with those in whom they do notdelight and similarly sour people do not quickly make friends eitherbut such men may bear goodwill to each other for they wish one anotherwell and aid one another in need but they are hardly friends becausethey do not spend their days together nor delight in each other andthese are thought the greatest marks of friendship one cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendshipof the perfect type with them just as one cannot be in love withmany people at once for love is a sort of excess of feeling andit is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person andit is not easy for many people at the same time to please the sameperson very greatly or perhaps even to be good in his eyes one musttoo acquire some experience of the other person and become familiarwith him and that is very hard but with a view to utility or pleasureit is possible that many people should please one for many peopleare useful or pleasant and these services take little timeof these two kinds that which is for the sake of pleasure is the morelike friendship when both parties get the same things from each otherand delight in each other or in the things as in the friendshipsof the young for generosity is more found in such friendships friendshipbased on utility is for the commercially minded people who are supremelyhappy too have no need of useful friends but do need pleasant friendsfor they wish to live with some one and though they can endure fora short time what is painful no one could put up with it continuouslynor even with the good itself if it were painful to him this is whythey look out for friends who are pleasant perhaps they should lookout for friends who being pleasant are also good and good for themtoo for so they will have all the characteristics that friends shouldhave people in positions of authority seem to have friends who fall intodistinct classes some people are useful to them and others are pleasantbut the same people are rarely both for they seek neither those whosepleasantness is accompanied by virtue nor those whose utility is witha view to noble objects but in their desire for pleasure they seekfor readywitted people and their other friends they choose as beingclever at doing what they are told and these characteristics arerarely combined now we have said that the good man is at the sametime pleasant and useful but such a man does not become the friendof one who surpasses him in station unless he is surpassed also invirtue if this is not so he does not establish equality by beingproportionally exceeded in both respects but people who surpass himin both respects are not so easy to find however that may be the aforesaid friendships involve equality forthe friends get the same things from one another and wish the samethings for one another or exchange one thing for another eg pleasurefor utility we have said however that they are both less trulyfriendships and less permanent but it is from their likeness and their unlikeness to the same thingthat they are thought both to be and not to be friendships it isby their likeness to the friendship of virtue that they seem to befriendships for one of them involves pleasure and the other utilityand these characteristics belong to the friendship of virtue as wellwhile it is because the friendship of virtue is proof against slanderand permanent while these quickly change besides differing fromthe former in many other respects that they appear not to be friendshipsie it is because of their unlikeness to the friendship of virtue but there is another kind of friendship viz that which involvesan inequality between the parties eg that of father to son andin general of elder to younger that of man to wife and in generalthat of ruler to subject and these friendships differ also from eachother for it is not the same that exists between parents and childrenand between rulers and subjects nor is even that of father to sonthe same as that of son to father nor that of husband to wife thesame as that of wife to husband for the virtue and the function ofeach of these is different and so are the reasons for which theylove the love and the friendship are therefore different also eachparty then neither gets the same from the other nor ought to seekit but when children render to parents what they ought to renderto those who brought them into the world and parents render whatthey should to their children the friendship of such persons willbe abiding and excellent in all friendships implying inequality thelove also should be proportional ie the better should be more lovedthan he loves and so should the more useful and similarly in eachof the other cases for when the love is in proportion to the meritof the parties then in a sense arises equality which is certainlyheld to be characteristic of friendship but equality does not seem to take the same form in acts of justiceand in friendship for in acts of justice what is equal in the primarysense is that which is in proportion to merit while quantitativeequality is secondary but in friendship quantitative equality isprimary and proportion to merit secondary this becomes clear if thereis a great interval in respect of virtue or vice or wealth or anythingelse between the parties for then they are no longer friends anddo not even expect to be so and this is most manifest in the caseof the gods for they surpass us most decisively in all good thingsbut it is clear also in the case of kings for with them too menwho are much their inferiors do not expect to be friends nor do menof no account expect to be friends with the best or wisest men insuch cases it is not possible to define exactly up to what point friendscan remain friends for much can be taken away and friendship remainbut when one party is removed to a great distance as god is thepossibility of friendship ceases this is in fact the origin of thequestion whether friends really wish for their friends the greatestgoods eg that of being gods since in that case their friends willno longer be friends to them and therefore will not be good thingsfor them for friends are good things the answer is that if we wereright in saying that friend wishes good to friend for his sake hisfriend must remain the sort of being he is whatever that may betherefore it is for him oily so long as he remains a man that he willwish the greatest goods but perhaps not all the greatest goods forit is for himself most of all that each man wishes what is good most people seem owing to ambition to wish to be loved rather thanto love which is why most men love flattery for the flatterer isa friend in an inferior position or pretends to be such and to lovemore than he is loved and being loved seems to be akin to being honouredand this is what most people aim at but it seems to be not for itsown sake that people choose honour but incidentally for most peopleenjoy being honoured by those in positions of authority because oftheir hopes for they think that if they want anything they will getit from them and therefore they delight in honour as a token of favourto come while those who desire honour from good men and men whoknow are aiming at confirming their own opinion of themselves theydelight in honour therefore because they believe in their own goodnesson the strength of the judgement of those who speak about them inbeing loved on the other hand people delight for its own sake whenceit would seem to be better than being honoured and friendship tobe desirable in itself but it seems to lie in loving rather thanin being loved as is indicated by the delight mothers take in lovingfor some mothers hand over their children to be brought up and solong as they know their fate they love them and do not seek to beloved in return if they cannot have both but seem to be satisfiedif they see them prospering and they themselves love their childreneven if these owing to their ignorance give them nothing of a mothersdue now since friendship depends more on loving and it is thosewho love their friends that are praised loving seems to be the characteristicvirtue of friends so that it is only those in whom this is foundin due measure that are lasting friends and only their friendshipthat endures it is in this way more than any other that even unequals can be friendsthey can be equalized now equality and likeness are friendship andespecially the likeness of those who are like in virtue for beingsteadfast in themselves they hold fast to each other and neitherask nor give base services but one may say even prevent them forit is characteristic of good men neither to go wrong themselves norto let their friends do so but wicked men have no steadfastness forthey do not remain even like to themselves but become friends fora short time because they delight in each others wickedness friendswho are useful or pleasant last longer ie as long as they provideeach other with enjoyments or advantages friendship for utilityssake seems to be that which most easily exists between contrarieseg between poor and rich between ignorant and learned for whata man actually lacks he aims at and one gives something else in returnbut under this head too might bring lover and beloved beautifuland ugly this is why lovers sometimes seem ridiculous when theydemand to be loved as they love if they are equally lovable theirclaim can perhaps be justified but when they have nothing lovableabout them it is ridiculous perhaps however contrary does not evenaim at contrary by its own nature but only incidentally the desirebeing for what is intermediate for that is what is good eg itis good for the dry not to become wet but to come to the intermediatestate and similarly with the hot and in all other cases these subjectswe may dismiss for they are indeed somewhat foreign to our inquiry friendship and justice seem as we have said at the outset of ourdiscussion to be concerned with the same objects and exhibited betweenthe same persons for in every community there is thought to be someform of justice and friendship too at least men address as friendstheir fellowvoyagers and fellowsoldiers and so too those associatedwith them in any other kind of community and the extent of theirassociation is the extent of their friendship as it is the extentto which justice exists between them and the proverb what friendshave is common property expresses the truth for friendship dependson community now brothers and comrades have all things in commonbut the others to whom we have referred have definite things in commonsomemore things others fewer for of friendships too some are moreand others less truly friendships and the claims of justice differtoo the duties of parents to children and those of brothers to eachother are not the same nor those of comrades and those of fellowcitizensand so too with the other kinds of friendship there is a differencetherefore also between the acts that are unjust towards each of theseclasses of associates and the injustice increases by being exhibitedtowards those who are friends in a fuller sense eg it is a moreterrible thing to defraud a comrade than a fellowcitizen more terriblenot to help a brother than a stranger and more terrible to wounda father than any one else and the demands of justice also seem toincrease with the intensity of the friendship which implies thatfriendship and justice exist between the same persons and have anequal extension now all forms of community are like parts of the political communityfor men journey together with a view to some particular advantageand to provide something that they need for the purposes of lifeand it is for the sake of advantage that the political community tooseems both to have come together originally and to endure for thisis what legislators aim at and they call just that which is to thecommon advantage now the other communities aim at advantage bit bybit eg sailors at what is advantageous on a voyage with a viewto making money or something of the kind fellowsoldiers at whatis advantageous in war whether it is wealth or victory or the takingof a city that they seek and members of tribes and demes act similarlysome communities seem to arise for the sake or pleasure viz religiousguilds and social clubs for these exist respectively for the sakeof offering sacrifice and of companionship but all these seem tofall under the political community for it aims not at present advantagebut at what is advantageous for life as a whole offering sacrificesand arranging gatherings for the purpose and assigning honours tothe gods and providing pleasant relaxations for themselves for theancient sacrifices and gatherings seem to take place after the harvestas a sort of firstfruits because it was at these seasons that peoplehad most leisure all the communities then seem to be parts of thepolitical community and the particular kinds friendship will correspondto the particular kinds of community  there are three kinds of constitution and an equal number of deviationformsperversionsas it were of them the constitutions are monarchy aristocracyand thirdly that which is based on a property qualification whichit seems appropriate to call timocratic though most people are wontto call it polity the best of these is monarchy the worst timocracythe deviation from monarchy is tyrany for both are forms of onemanrule but there is the greatest difference between them the tyrantlooks to his own advantage the king to that of his subjects fora man is not a king unless he is sufficient to himself and excelshis subjects in all good things and such a man needs nothing furthertherefore he will not look to his own interests but to those of hissubjects for a king who is not like that would be a mere titularking now tyranny is the very contrary of this the tyrant pursueshis own good and it is clearer in the case of tyranny that it isthe worst deviationform but it is the contrary of the best thatis worst monarchy passes over into tyranny for tyranny is the evilform of oneman rule and the bad king becomes a tyrant aristocracypasses over into oligarchy by the badness of the rulers who distributecontrary to equity what belongs to the cityall or most of the goodthings to themselves and office always to the same people payingmost regard to wealth thus the rulers are few and are bad men insteadof the most worthy timocracy passes over into democracy for theseare coterminous since it is the ideal even of timocracy to be therule of the majority and all who have the property qualificationcount as equal democracy is the least bad of the deviations forin its case the form of constitution is but a slight deviation thesethen are the changes to which constitutions are most subject forthese are the smallest and easiest transitions one may find resemblances to the constitutions and as it were patternsof them even in households for the association of a father with hissons bears the form of monarchy since the father cares for his childrenand this is why homer calls zeus father it is the ideal of monarchyto be paternal rule but among the persians the rule of the fatheris tyrannical they use their sons as slaves tyrannical too is therule of a master over slaves for it is the advantage of the masterthat is brought about in it now this seems to be a correct form ofgovernment but the persian type is perverted for the modes of ruleappropriate to different relations are diverse the association ofman and wife seems to be aristocratic for the man rules in accordancewith his worth and in those matters in which a man should rule butthe matters that befit a woman he hands over to her if the man rulesin everything the relation passes over into oligarchy for in doingso he is not acting in accordance with their respective worth andnot ruling in virtue of his superiority sometimes however womenrule because they are heiresses so their rule is not in virtue ofexcellence but due to wealth and power as in oligarchies the associationof brothers is like timocracy for they are equal except in so faras they differ in age hence if they differ much in age the friendshipis no longer of the fraternal type democracy is found chiefly inmasterless dwellings for here every one is on an equality and inthose in which the ruler is weak and every one has licence to do ashe pleases  each of the constitutions may be seen to involve friendship just inso far as it involves justice the friendship between a king and hissubjects depends on an excess of benefits conferred for he confersbenefits on his subjects if being a good man he cares for them witha view to their wellbeing as a shepherd does for his sheep whencehomer called agamemnon shepherd of the peoples such too is thefriendship of a father though this exceeds the other in the greatnessof the benefits conferred for he is responsible for the existenceof his children which is thought the greatest good and for theirnurture and upbringing these things are ascribed to ancestors as well further by naturea father tends to rule over his sons ancestors over descendantsa king over his subjects these friendships imply superiority of oneparty over the other which is why ancestors are honoured the justicetherefore that exists between persons so related is not the same onboth sides but is in every case proportioned to merit for that istrue of the friendship as well the friendship of man and wife againis the same that is found in an aristocracy for it is in accordancewith virtue the better gets more of what is good and each gets whatbefits him and so too with the justice in these relations thefriendship of brothers is like that of comrades for they are equaland of like age and such persons are for the most part like in theirfeelings and their character like this too is the friendship appropriateto timocratic government for in such a constitution the ideal isfor the citizens to be equal and fair therefore rule is taken inturn and on equal terms and the friendship appropriate here willcorrespond but in the deviationforms as justice hardly exists so too doesfriendship it exists least in the worst form in tyranny there islittle or no friendship for where there is nothing common to rulerand ruled there is not friendship either since there is not justiceeg between craftsman and tool soul and body master and slavethe latter in each case is benefited by that which uses it but thereis no friendship nor justice towards lifeless things but neitheris there friendship towards a horse or an ox nor to a slave qua slavefor there is nothing common to the two parties the slave is a livingtool and the tool a lifeless slave qua slave then one cannot befriends with him but qua man one can for there seems to be somejustice between any man and any other who can share in a system oflaw or be a party to an agreement therefore there can also be friendshipwith him in so far as he is a man therefore while in tyrannies friendshipand justice hardly exist in democracies they exist more fully forwhere the citizens are equal they have much in common  every form of friendship then involves association as has beensaid one might however mark off from the rest both the friendshipof kindred and that of comrades those of fellowcitizens fellowtribesmenfellowvoyagers and the like are more like mere friendships of associationfor they seem to rest on a sort of compact with them we might classthe friendship of host and guest the friendship of kinsmen itselfwhile it seems to be of many kinds appears to depend in every caseon parental friendship for parents love their children as being apart of themselves and children their parents as being somethingoriginating from them now  arents know their offspring betterthan there children know that they are their children and  theoriginator feels his offspring to be his own more than the offspringdo their begetter for the product belongs to the producer eg atooth or hair or anything else to him whose it is but the producerdoes not belong to the product or belongs in a less degree and the length of time produces the same result parents love their childrenas soon as these are born but children love their parents only aftertime has elapsed and they have acquired understanding or the powerof discrimination by the senses from these considerations it is alsoplain why mothers love more than fathers do parents then love theirchildren as themselves for their issue are by virtue of their separateexistence a sort of other selves while children love their parentsas being born of them and brothers love each other as being bornof the same parents for their identity with them makes them identicalwith each other which is the reason why people talk of the sameblood the same stock and so on they are therefore in a sensethe same thing though in separate individuals two things that contributegreatly to friendship are a common upbringing and similarity of agefor two of an age take to each other and people brought up togethertend to be comrades whence the friendship of brothers is akin tothat of comrades and cousins and other kinsmen are bound up togetherby derivation from brothers viz by being derived from the same parentsthey come to be closer together or farther apart by virtue of thenearness or distance of the original ancestor the friendship of children to parents and of men to gods is a relationto them as to something good and superior for they have conferredthe greatest benefits since they are the causes of their being andof their nourishment and of their education from their birth andthis kind of friendship possesses pleasantness and utility also morethan that of strangers inasmuch as their life is lived more in commonthe friendship of brothers has the characteristics found in that ofcomrades and especially when these are good and in general betweenpeople who are like each other inasmuch as they belong more to eachother and start with a love for each other from their very birthand inasmuch as those born of the same parents and brought up togetherand similarly educated are more akin in character and the test oftime has been applied most fully and convincingly in their casebetween other kinsmen friendly relations are found in due proportionbetween man and wife friendship seems to exist by nature for manis naturally inclined to form coupleseven more than to form citiesinasmuch as the household is earlier and more necessary than the cityand reproduction is more common to man with the animals with theother animals the union extends only to this point but human beingslive together not only for the sake of reproduction but also for thevarious purposes of life for from the start the functions are dividedand those of man and woman are different so they help each otherby throwing their peculiar gifts into the common stock it is forthese reasons that both utility and pleasure seem to be found in thiskind of friendship but this friendship may be based also on virtueif the parties are good for each has its own virtue and they willdelight in the fact and children seem to be a bond of union whichis the reason why childless people part more easily for childrenare a good common to both and what is common holds them togetherhow man and wife and in general friend and friend ought mutually tobehave seems to be the same question as how it is just for them tobehave for a man does not seem to have the same duties to a frienda stranger a comrade and a schoolfellow  there are three kinds of friendship as we said at the outset of ourinquiry and in respect of each some are friends on an equality andothers by virtue of a superiority for not only can equally good menbecome friends but a better man can make friends with a worse andsimilarly in friendships of pleasure or utility the friends may beequal or unequal in the benefits they confer this being so equalsmust effect the required equalization on a basis of equality in loveand in all other respects while unequals must render what is in proportionto their superiority or inferiority complaints and reproaches ariseeither only or chiefly in the friendship of utility and this is onlyto be expected for those who are friends on the ground of virtueare anxious to do well by each other since that is a mark of virtueand of friendship and between men who are emulating each other inthis there cannot be complaints or quarrels no one is offended bya man who loves him and does well by himif he is a person of nicefeeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the other and the manwho excels the other in the services he renders will not complainof his friend since he gets what he aims at for each man desireswhat is good nor do complaints arise much even in friendships ofpleasure for both get at the same time what they desire if theyenjoy spending their time together and even a man who complainedof another for not affording him pleasure would seem ridiculous sinceit is in his power not to spend his days with him but the friendship of utility is full of complaints for as they useeach other for their own interests they always want to get the betterof the bargain and think they have got less than they should andblame their partners because they do not get all they want and deserveand those who do well by others cannot help them as much as thosewhom they benefit want now it seems that as justice is of two kinds one unwritten and theother legal one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the otherlegal and so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolvethe relation in the spirit of the same type of friendship in whichthey contracted it the legal type is that which is on fixed termsits purely commercial variety is on the basis of immediate paymentwhile the more liberal variety allows time but stipulates for a definitequid pro quo in this variety the debt is clear and not ambiguousbut in the postponement it contains an element of friendliness andso some states do not allow suits arising out of such agreementsbut think men who have bargained on a basis of credit ought to acceptthe consequences the moral type is not on fixed terms it makes agift or does whatever it does as to a friend but one expects toreceive as much or more as having not given but lent and if a manis worse off when the relation is dissolved than he was when it wascontracted he will complain this happens because all or most menwhile they wish for what is noble choose what is advantageous nowit is noble to do well by another without a view to repayment butit is the receiving of benefits that is advantageous therefore ifwe can we should return the equivalent of what we have received forwe must not make a man our friend against his will we must recognizethat we were mistaken at the first and took a benefit from a personwe should not have taken it fromsince it was not from a friend norfrom one who did it just for the sake of acting soand we must settleup just as if we had been benefited on fixed terms indeed one wouldagree to repay if one could if one could not even the giver wouldnot have expected one to do so therefore if it is possible we mustrepay but at the outset we must consider the man by whom we are beingbenefited and on what terms he is acting in order that we may acceptthe benefit on these terms or else decline it it is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its utilityto the receiver and make the return with a view to that or by thebenevolence of the giver for those who have received say they havereceived from their benefactors what meant little to the latter andwhat they might have got from othersminimizing the service whilethe givers on the contrary say it was the biggest thing they hadand what could not have been got from others and that it was givenin times of danger or similar need now if the friendship is one thataims at utility surely the advantage to the receiver is the measurefor it is he that asks for the service and the other man helps himon the assumption that he will receive the equivalent so the assistancehas been precisely as great as the advantage to the receiver andtherefore he must return as much as he has received or even morefor that would be nobler in friendships based on virtue on theother hand complaints do not arise but the purpose of the doer isa sort of measure for in purpose lies the essential element of virtueand character  differences arise also in friendships based on superiority for eachexpects to get more out of them but when this happens the friendshipis dissolved not only does the better man think he ought to get moresince more should be assigned to a good man but the more useful similarlyexpects this they say a useless man should not get as much as theyshould since it becomes an act of public service and not a friendshipif the proceeds of the friendship do not answer to the worth of thebenefits conferred for they think that as in a commercial partnershipthose who put more in get more out so it should be in friendshipbut the man who is in a state of need and inferiority makes the oppositeclaim they think it is the part of a good friend to help those whoare in need what they say is the use of being the friend of a goodman or a powerful man if one is to get nothing out of itat all events it seems that each party is justified in his claimand that each should get more out of the friendship than the othernotmore of the same thing however but the superior more honour andthe inferior more gain for honour is the prize of virtue and of beneficencewhile gain is the assistance required by inferiority it seems to be so in constitutional arrangements also the man whocontributes nothing good to the common stock is not honoured forwhat belongs to the public is given to the man who benefits the publicand honour does belong to the public it is not possible to get wealthfrom the common stock and at the same time honour for no one putsup with the smaller share in all things therefore to the man wholoses in wealth they assign honour and to the man who is willing tobe paid wealth since the proportion to merit equalizes the partiesand preserves the friendship as we have said this then is also theway in which we should associate with unequals the man who is benefitedin respect of wealth or virtue must give honour in return repayingwhat he can for friendship asks a man to do what he can not whatis proportional to the merits of the case since that cannot alwaysbe done eg in honours paid to the gods or to parents for no onecould ever return to them the equivalent of what he gets but theman who serves them to the utmost of his power is thought to be agood man this is why it would not seem open to a man to disown hisfather though a father may disown his son being in debt he shouldrepay but there is nothing by doing which a son will have done theequivalent of what he has received so that he is always in debtbut creditors can remit a debt and a father can therefore do so tooat the same time it is thought that presumably no one would repudiatea son who was not far gone in wickedness for apart from the naturalfriendship of father and son it is human nature not to reject a sonsassistance but the son if he is wicked will naturally avoid aidinghis father or not be zealous about it for most people wish to getbenefits but avoid doing them as a thing unprofitableso much forthese questions book ix in all friendships between dissimilars it is as we have said proportionthat equalizes the parties and preserves the friendship eg in thepolitical form of friendship the shoemaker gets a return for his shoesin proportion to his worth and the weaver and all other craftsmendo the same now here a common measure has been provided in the formof money and therefore everything is referred to this and measuredby this but in the friendship of lovers sometimes the lover complainsthat his excess of love is not met by love in return though perhapsthere is nothing lovable about him while often the beloved complainsthat the lover who formerly promised everything now performs nothingsuch incidents happen when the lover loves the beloved for the sakeof pleasure while the beloved loves the lover for the sake of utilityand they do not both possess the qualities expected of them if thesebe the objects of the friendship it is dissolved when they do notget the things that formed the motives of their love for each didnot love the other person himself but the qualities he had and thesewere not enduring that is why the friendships also are transientbut the love of characters as has been said endures because it isselfdependent differences arise when what they get is somethingdifferent and not what they desire for it is like getting nothingat all when we do not get what we aim at compare the story of theperson who made promises to a lyreplayer promising him the morethe better he sang but in the morning when the other demanded thefulfilment of his promises said that he had given pleasure for pleasurenow if this had been what each wanted all would have been well butif the one wanted enjoyment but the other gain and the one has whathe wants while the other has not the terms of the association willnot have been properly fulfilled for what each in fact wants is whathe attends to and it is for the sake of that that that he will givewhat he has but who is to fix the worth of the service he who makes the sacrificeor he who has got the advantage at any rate the other seems to leaveit to him this is what they say protagoras used to do whenever hetaught anything whatsoever he bade the learner assess the value ofthe knowledge and accepted the amount so fixed but in such matterssome men approve of the saying let a man have his fixed rewardthose who get the money first and then do none of the things theysaid they would owing to the extravagance of their promises naturallyfind themselves the objects of complaint for they do not fulfil whatthey agreed to the sophists are perhaps compelled to do this becauseno one would give money for the things they do know these peoplethen if they do not do what they have been paid for are naturallymade the objects of complaint but where there is no contract of service those who give up somethingfor the sake of the other party cannot as we have said be complainedof for that is the nature of the friendship of virtue and the returnto them must be made on the basis of their purpose for it is purposethat is the characteristic thing in a friend and in virtue and sotoo it seems should one make a return to those with whom one hasstudied philosophy for their worth cannot be measured against moneyand they can get no honour which will balance their services butstill it is perhaps enough as it is with the gods and with onesparents to give them what one can if the gift was not of this sort but was made with a view to a returnit is no doubt preferable that the return made should be one thatseems fair to both parties but if this cannot be achieved it wouldseem not only necessary that the person who gets the first serviceshould fix the reward but also just for if the other gets in returnthe equivalent of the advantage the beneficiary has received or theprice lie would have paid for the pleasure he will have got whatis fair as from the other we see this happening too with things put up for sale and in someplaces there are laws providing that no actions shall arise out ofvoluntary contracts on the assumption that one should settle witha person to whom one has given credit in the spirit in which onebargained with him the law holds that it is more just that the personto whom credit was given should fix the terms than that the personwho gave credit should do so for most things are not assessed atthe same value by those who have them and those who want them eachclass values highly what is its own and what it is offering yet thereturn is made on the terms fixed by the receiver but no doubt thereceiver should assess a thing not at what it seems worth when hehas it but at what he assessed it at before he had it  a further problem is set by such questions as whether one shouldin all things give the preference to ones father and obey him orwhether when one is ill one should trust a doctor and when one hasto elect a general should elect a man of military skill and similarlywhether one should render a service by preference to a friend or toa good man and should show gratitude to a benefactor or oblige afriend if one cannot do both all such questions are hard are they not to decide with precisionfor they admit of many variations of all sorts in respect both ofthe magnitude of the service and of its nobility necessity but thatwe should not give the preference in all things to the same personis plain enough and we must for the most part return benefits ratherthan oblige friends as we must pay back a loan to a creditor ratherthan make one to a friend but perhaps even this is not always trueeg should a man who has been ransomed out of the hands of brigandsransom his ransomer in return whoever he may be or pay him if hehas not been captured but demands payment or should he ransom hisfather it would seem that he should ransom his father in preferenceeven to himself as we have said then generally the debt shouldbe paid but if the gift is exceedingly noble or exceedingly necessaryone should defer to these considerations for sometimes it is noteven fair to return the equivalent of what one has received whenthe one man has done a service to one whom he knows to be good whilethe other makes a return to one whom he believes to be bad for thatmatter one should sometimes not lend in return to one who has lentto oneself for the one person lent to a good man expecting to recoverhis loan while the other has no hope of recovering from one who isbelieved to be bad therefore if the facts really are so the demandis not fair and if they are not but people think they are theywould be held to be doing nothing strange in refusing as we haveoften pointed out then discussions about feelings and actions havejust as much definiteness as their subjectmatter that we should not make the same return to every one nor give a fatherthe preference in everything as one does not sacrifice everythingto zeus is plain enough but since we ought to render different thingsto parents brothers comrades and benefactors we ought to renderto each class what is appropriate and becoming and this is what peopleseem in fact to do to marriages they invite their kinsfolk for thesehave a part in the family and therefore in the doings that affectthe family and at funerals also they think that kinsfolk beforeall others should meet for the same reason and it would be thoughtthat in the matter of food we should help our parents before all otherssince we owe our own nourishment to them and it is more honourableto help in this respect the authors of our being even before ourselvesand honour too one should give to ones parents as one does to thegods but not any and every honour for that matter one should notgive the same honour to ones father and ones mother nor again shouldone give them the honour due to a philosopher or to a general butthe honour due to a father or again to a mother to all older personstoo one should give honour appropriate to their age by rising toreceive them and finding seats for them and so on while to comradesand brothers one should allow freedom of speech and common use ofall things to kinsmen too and fellowtribesmen and fellowcitizensand to every other class one should always try to assign what is appropriateand to compare the claims of each class with respect to nearness ofrelation and to virtue or usefulness the comparison is easier whenthe persons belong to the same class and more laborious when theyare different yet we must not on that account shrink from the taskbut decide the question as best we can  another question that arises is whether friendships should or shouldnot be broken off when the other party does not remain the same perhapswe may say that there is nothing strange in breaking off a friendshipbased on utility or pleasure when our friends no longer have theseattributes for it was of these attributes that we were the friendsand when these have failed it is reasonable to love no longer butone might complain of another if when he loved us for our usefulnessor pleasantness he pretended to love us for our character for aswe said at the outset most differences arise between friends whenthey are not friends in the spirit in which they think they are sowhen a man has deceived himself and has thought he was being lovedfor his character when the other person was doing nothing of thekind he must blame himself when he has been deceived by the pretencesof the other person it is just that he should complain against hisdeceiver he will complain with more justice than one does againstpeople who counterfeit the currency inasmuch as the wrongdoing isconcerned with something more valuable but if one accepts another man as good and he turns out badly andis seen to do so must one still love him surely it is impossiblesince not everything can be loved but only what is good what isevil neither can nor should be loved for it is not ones duty tobe a lover of evil nor to become like what is bad and we have saidthat like is dear like must the friendship then be forthwith brokenoff or is this not so in all cases but only when ones friends areincurable in their wickedness if they are capable of being reformedone should rather come to the assistance of their character or theirproperty inasmuch as this is better and more characteristic of friendshipbut a man who breaks off such a friendship would seem to be doingnothing strange for it was not to a man of this sort that he wasa friend when his friend has changed therefore and he is unableto save him he gives him up but if one friend remained the same while the other became betterand far outstripped him in virtue should the latter treat the formeras a friend surely he cannot when the interval is great this becomesmost plain eg in the case of childish friendships if one friendremained a child in intellect while the other became a fully developedman how could they be friends when they neither approved of the samethings nor delighted in and were pained by the same things for noteven with regard to each other will their tastes agree and withoutthis as we saw they cannot be friends for they cannot live togetherbut we have discussed these matters should he then behave no otherwise towards him than he would ifhe had never been his friend surely he should keep a remembranceof their former intimacy and as we think we ought to oblige friendsrather than strangers so to those who have been our friends we oughtto make some allowance for our former friendship when the breachhas not been due to excess of wickedness  friendly relations with ones neighbours and the marks by which friendshipsare defined seem to have proceeded from a mans relations to himselffor  we define a friend as one who wishes and does what is goodor seems so for the sake of his friend or  as one who wisheshis friend to exist and live for his sake which mothers do to theirchildren and friends do who have come into conflict and  othersdefine him as one who lives with and  has the same tastes as anotheror  one who grieves and rejoices with his friend and this toois found in mothers most of all it is by some one of these charactersticsthat friendship too is defined now each of these is true of the good mans relation to himself andof all other men in so far as they think themselves good virtue andthe good man seem as has been said to be the measure of every classof things for his opinions are harmonious and he desires the samethings with all his soul and therefore he wishes for himself whatis good and what seems so and does it for it is characteristic ofthe good man to work out the good and does so for his own sake forhe does it for the sake of the intellectual element in him whichis thought to be the man himself and he wishes himself to live andbe preserved and especially the element by virtue of which he thinksfor existence is good to the virtuous man and each man wishes himselfwhat is good while no one chooses to possess the whole world if hehas first to become some one else for that matter even now god possessesthe good he wishes for this only on condition of being whateverhe is and the element that thinks would seem to be the individualman or to be so more than any other element in him and such a manwishes to live with himself for he does so with pleasure since thememories of his past acts are delightful and his hopes for the futureare good and therefore pleasant his mind is well stored too withsubjects of contemplation and he grieves and rejoices more thanany other with himself for the same thing is always painful andthe same thing always pleasant and not one thing at one time andanother at another he has so to speak nothing to repent oftherefore since each of these characteristics belongs to the goodman in relation to himself and he is related to his friend as tohimself for his friend is another self friendship too is thoughtto be one of these attributes and those who have these attributesto be friends whether there is or is not friendship between a manand himself is a question we may dismiss for the present there wouldseem to be friendship in so far as he is two or more to judge fromthe aforementioned attributes of friendship and from the fact thatthe extreme of friendship is likened to ones love for oneselfbut the attributes named seem to belong even to the majority of menpoor creatures though they may be are we to say then that in so faras they are satisfied with themselves and think they are good theyshare in these attributes certainly no one who is thoroughly badand impious has these attributes or even seems to do so they hardlybelong even to inferior people for they are at variance with themselvesand have appetites for some things and rational desires for othersthis is true for instance of incontinent people for they chooseinstead of the things they themselves think good things that arepleasant but hurtful while others again through cowardice and lazinessshrink from doing what they think best for themselves and those whohave done many terrible deeds and are hated for their wickedness evenshrink from life and destroy themselves and wicked men seek for peoplewith whom to spend their days and shun themselves for they remembermany a grevious deed and anticipate others like them when they areby themselves but when they are with others they forget and havingnothing lovable in them they have no feeling of love to themselvestherefore also such men do not rejoice or grieve with themselvesfor their soul is rent by faction and one element in it by reasonof its wickedness grieves when it abstains from certain acts whilethe other part is pleased and one draws them this way and the otherthat as if they were pulling them in pieces if a man cannot at thesame time be pained and pleased at all events after a short timehe is pained because he was pleased and he could have wished thatthese things had not been pleasant to him for bad men are laden withrepentance therefore the bad man does not seem to be amicably disposed even tohimself because there is nothing in him to love so that if to bethus is the height of wretchedness we should strain every nerve toavoid wickedness and should endeavour to be good for so and onlyso can one be either friendly to oneself or a friend to another goodwill is a friendly sort of relation but is not identical withfriendship for one may have goodwill both towards people whom onedoes not know and without their knowing it but not friendship thishas indeed been said already but goodwill is not even friendly feelingfor it does not involve intensity or desire whereas these accompanyfriendly feeling and friendly feeling implies intimacy while goodwillmay arise of a sudden as it does towards competitors in a contestwe come to feel goodwill for them and to share in their wishes butwe would not do anything with them for as we said we feel goodwillsuddenly and love them only superficially goodwill seems then to be a beginning of friendship as the pleasureof the eye is the beginning of love for no one loves if he has notfirst been delighted by the form of the beloved but he who delightsin the form of another does not for all that love him but onlydoes so when he also longs for him when absent and craves for hispresence so too it is not possible for people to be friends if theyhave not come to feel goodwill for each other but those who feelgoodwill are not for all that friends for they only wish well tothose for whom they feel goodwill and would not do anything withthem nor take trouble for them and so one might by an extension ofthe term friendship say that goodwill is inactive friendship thoughwhen it is prolonged and reaches the point of intimacy it becomesfriendshipnot the friendship based on utility nor that based on pleasurefor goodwill too does not arise on those terms the man who has receiveda benefit bestows goodwill in return for what has been done to himbut in doing so is only doing what is just while he who wishes someone to prosper because he hopes for enrichment through him seems tohave goodwill not to him but rather to himself just as a man is nota friend to another if he cherishes him for the sake of some use tobe made of him in general goodwill arises on account of some excellenceand worth when one man seems to another beautiful or brave or somethingof the sort as we pointed out in the case of competitors in a contest unanimity also seems to be a friendly relation for this reason itis not identity of opinion for that might occur even with peoplewho do not know each other nor do we say that people who have thesame views on any and every subject are unanimous eg those whoagree about the heavenly bodies for unanimity about these is nota friendly relation but we do say that a city is unanimous whenmen have the same opinion about what is to their interest and choosethe same actions and do what they have resolved in common it isabout things to be done therefore that people are said to be unanimousand among these about matters of consequence and in which it ispossible for both or all parties to get what they want eg a cityis unanimous when all its citizens think that the offices in it shouldbe elective or that they should form an alliance with sparta orthat pittacus should be their rulerat a time when he himself wasalso willing to rule but when each of two people wishes himself tohave the thing in question like the captains in the phoenissae theyare in a state of faction for it is not unanimity when each of twoparties thinks of the same thing whatever that may be but only whenthey think of the same thing in the same hands eg when both thecommon people and those of the better class wish the best men to rulefor thus and thus alone do all get what they aim at unanimity seemsthen to be political friendship as indeed it is commonly said tobe for it is concerned with things that are to our interest and havean influence on our life now such unanimity is found among good men for they are unanimousboth in themselves and with one another being so to say of onemind for the wishes of such men are constant and not at the mercyof opposing currents like a strait of the sea and they wish forwhat is just and what is advantageous and these are the objects oftheir common endeavour as well but bad men cannot be unanimous exceptto a small extent any more than they can be friends since they aimat getting more than their share of advantages while in labour andpublic service they fall short of their share and each man wishingfor advantage to himself criticizes his neighbour and stands in hisway for if people do not watch it carefully the common weal is soondestroyed the result is that they are in a state of faction puttingcompulsion on each other but unwilling themselves to do what is just benefactors are thought to love those they have benefited more thanthose who have been well treated love those that have treated themwell and this is discussed as though it were paradoxical most peoplethink it is because the latter are in the position of debtors andthe former of creditors and therefore as in the case of loans debtorswish their creditors did not exist while creditors actually takecare of the safety of their debtors so it is thought that benefactorswish the objects of their action to exist since they will then gettheir gratitude while the beneficiaries take no interest in makingthis return epicharmus would perhaps declare that they say this becausethey look at things on their bad side but it is quite like humannature for most people are forgetful and are more anxious to bewell treated than to treat others well but the cause would seem tobe more deeply rooted in the nature of things the case of those whohave lent money is not even analogous for they have no friendly feelingto their debtors but only a wish that they may kept safe with a viewto what is to be got from them while those who have done a serviceto others feel friendship and love for those they have served evenif these are not of any use to them and never will be this is whathappens with craftsmen too every man loves his own handiwork betterthan he would be loved by it if it came alive and this happens perhapsmost of all with poets for they have an excessive love for theirown poems doting on them as if they were their children this iswhat the position of benefactors is like for that which they havetreated well is their handiwork and therefore they love this morethan the handiwork does its maker the cause of this is that existenceis to all men a thing to be chosen and loved and that we exist byvirtue of activity ie by living and acting and that the handiworkis in a sense the producer in activity he loves his handiwork thereforebecause he loves existence and this is rooted in the nature of thingsfor what he is in potentiality his handiwork manifests in activityat the same time to the benefactor that is noble which depends onhis action so that he delights in the object of his action whereasto the patient there is nothing noble in the agent but at most somethingadvantageous and this is less pleasant and lovable what is pleasantis the activity of the present the hope of the future the memoryof the past but most pleasant is that which depends on activityand similarly this is most lovable now for a man who has made somethinghis work remains for the noble is lasting but for the person actedon the utility passes away and the memory of noble things is pleasantbut that of useful things is not likely to be pleasant or is lessso though the reverse seems true of expectation further love is like activity being loved like passivity and lovingand its concomitants are attributes of those who are the more activeagain all men love more what they have won by labour eg thosewho have made their money love it more than those who have inheritedit and to be well treated seems to involve no labour while to treatothers well is a laborious task these are the reasons too why mothersare fonder of their children than fathers bringing them into theworld costs them more pains and they know better that the childrenare their own this last point too would seem to apply to benefactors the question is also debated whether a man should love himself mostor some one else people criticize those who love themselves mostand call them selflovers using this as an epithet of disgrace anda bad man seems to do everything for his own sake and the more sothe more wicked he isand so men reproach him for instance withdoing nothing of his own accordwhile the good man acts for honourssake and the more so the better he is and acts for his friendssake and sacrifices his own interest but the facts clash with these arguments and this is not surprisingfor men say that one ought to love best ones best friend and mansbest friend is one who wishes well to the object of his wish for hissake even if no one is to know of it and these attributes are foundmost of all in a mans attitude towards himself and so are all theother attributes by which a friend is defined for as we have saidit is from this relation that all the characteristics of friendshiphave extended to our neighbours all the proverbs too agree withthis eg a single soul and what friends have is common propertyand friendship is equality and charity begins at home for allthese marks will be found most in a mans relation to himself heis his own best friend and therefore ought to love himself best itis therefore a reasonable question which of the two views we shouldfollow for both are plausible perhaps we ought to mark off such arguments from each other and determinehow far and in what respects each view is right now if we grasp thesense in which each school uses the phrase lover of self the truthmay become evident those who use the term as one of reproach ascribeselflove to people who assign to themselves the greater share ofwealth honours and bodily pleasures for these are what most peopledesire and busy themselves about as though they were the best ofall things which is the reason too why they become objects of competitionso those who are grasping with regard to these things gratify theirappetites and in general their feelings and the irrational elementof the soul and most men are of this nature which is the reasonwhy the epithet has come to be used as it isit takes its meaningfrom the prevailing type of selflove which is a bad one it isjust therefore that men who are lovers of self in this way are reproachedfor being so that it is those who give themselves the preferencein regard to objects of this sort that most people usually call loversof self is plain for if a man were always anxious that he himselfabove all things should act justly temperately or in accordancewith any other of the virtues and in general were always to try tosecure for himself the honourable course no one will call such aman a lover of self or blame him but such a man would seem more than the other a lover of self atall events he assigns to himself the things that are noblest and bestand gratifies the most authoritative element in and in all thingsobeys this and just as a city or any other systematic whole is mostproperly identified with the most authoritative element in it sois a man and therefore the man who loves this and gratifies it ismost of all a lover of self besides a man is said to have or notto have selfcontrol according as his reason has or has not the controlon the assumption that this is the man himself and the things menhave done on a rational principle are thought most properly theirown acts and voluntary acts that this is the man himself then oris so more than anything else is plain and also that the good manloves most this part of him whence it follows that he is most trulya lover of self of another type than that which is a matter of reproachand as different from that as living according to a rational principleis from living as passion dictates and desiring what is noble fromdesiring what seems advantageous those then who busy themselvesin an exceptional degree with noble actions all men approve and praiseand if all were to strive towards what is noble and strain every nerveto do the noblest deeds everything would be as it should be for thecommon weal and every one would secure for himself the goods thatare greatest since virtue is the greatest of goods therefore the good man should be a lover of self for he will bothhimself profit by doing noble acts and will benefit his fellowsbut the wicked man should not for he will hurt both himself and hisneighbours following as he does evil passions for the wicked manwhat he does clashes with what he ought to do but what the good manought to do he does for reason in each of its possessors chooseswhat is best for itself and the good man obeys his reason it istrue of the good man too that he does many acts for the sake of hisfriends and his country and if necessary dies for them for he willthrow away both wealth and honours and in general the goods that areobjects of competition gaining for himself nobility since he wouldprefer a short period of intense pleasure to a long one of mild enjoymenta twelvemonth of noble life to many years of humdrum existence andone great and noble action to many trivial ones now those who diefor others doubtless attain this result it is therefore a great prizethat they choose for themselves they will throw away wealth too oncondition that their friends will gain more for while a mans friendgains wealth he himself achieves nobility he is therefore assigningthe greater good to himself the same too is true of honour and officeall these things he will sacrifice to his friend for this is nobleand laudable for himself rightly then is he thought to be good sincehe chooses nobility before all else but he may even give up actionsto his friend it may be nobler to become the cause of his friendsacting than to act himself in all the actions therefore that menare praised for the good man is seen to assign to himself the greatershare in what is noble in this sense then as has been said a manshould be a lover of self but in the sense in which most men areso he ought not  it is also disputed whether the happy man will need friends or notit is said that those who are supremely happy and selfsufficienthave no need of friends for they have the things that are good andtherefore being selfsufficient they need nothing further while afriend being another self furnishes what a man cannot provide byhis own effort whence the saying when fortune is kind what needof friends but it seems strange when one assigns all good thingsto the happy man not to assign friends who are thought the greatestof external goods and if it is more characteristic of a friend todo well by another than to be well done by and to confer benefitsis characteristic of the good man and of virtue and it is noblerto do well by friends than by strangers the good man will need peopleto do well by this is why the question is asked whether we need friendsmore in prosperity or in adversity on the assumption that not onlydoes a man in adversity need people to confer benefits on him butalso those who are prospering need people to do well by surely itis strange too to make the supremely happy man a solitary for noone would choose the whole world on condition of being alone sinceman is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with otherstherefore even the happy man lives with others for he has the thingsthat are by nature good and plainly it is better to spend his dayswith friends and good men than with strangers or any chance personstherefore the happy man needs friends what then is it that the first school means and in what respect isit right is it that most identify friends with useful people ofsuch friends indeed the supremely happy man will have no need sincehe already has the things that are good nor will he need those whomone makes ones friends because of their pleasantness or he willneed them only to a small extent for his life being pleasant hasno need of adventitious pleasure and because he does not need suchfriends he is thought not to need friends but that is surely not true for we have said at the outset that happinessis an activity and activity plainly comes into being and is not presentat the start like a piece of property if  happiness lies in livingand being active and the good mans activity is virtuous and pleasantin itself as we have said at the outset and  a things beingones own is one of the attributes that make it pleasant and we can contemplate our neighbours better than ourselves and theiractions better than our own and if the actions of virtuous men whoare their friends are pleasant to good men since these have boththe attributes that are naturally pleasantif this be so the supremelyhappy man will need friends of this sort since his purpose is tocontemplate worthy actions and actions that are his own and the actionsof a good man who is his friend have both these qualitiesfurther men think that the happy man ought to live pleasantly nowif he were a solitary life would be hard for him for by oneselfit is not easy to be continuously active but with others and towardsothers it is easier with others therefore his activity will be morecontinuous and it is in itself pleasant as it ought to be for theman who is supremely happy for a good man qua good delights in virtuousactions and is vexed at vicious ones as a musical man enjoys beautifultunes but is pained at bad ones a certain training in virtue arisesalso from the company of the good as theognis has said before usif we look deeper into the nature of things a virtuous friend seemsto be naturally desirable for a virtuous man for that which is goodby nature we have said is for the virtuous man good and pleasantin itself now life is defined in the case of animals by the powerof perception in that of man by the power of perception or thoughtand a power is defined by reference to the corresponding activitywhich is the essential thing therefore life seems to be essentiallythe act of perceiving or thinking and life is among the things thatare good and pleasant in themselves since it is determinate and thedeterminate is of the nature of the good and that which is good bynature is also good for the virtuous man which is the reason whylife seems pleasant to all men but we must not apply this to a wickedand corrupt life nor to a life spent in pain for such a life is indeterminateas are its attributes the nature of pain will become plainer in whatfollows but if life itself is good and pleasant which it seems tobe from the very fact that all men desire it and particularly thosewho are good and supremely happy for to such men life is most desirableand their existence is the most supremely happy and if he who seesperceives that he sees and he who hears that he hears and he whowalks that he walks and in the case of all other activities similarlythere is something which perceives that we are active so that ifwe perceive we perceive that we perceive and if we think that wethink and if to perceive that we perceive or think is to perceivethat we exist for existence was defined as perceiving or thinkingand if perceiving that one lives is in itself one of the things thatare pleasant for life is by nature good and to perceive what isgood present in oneself is pleasant and if life is desirable andparticularly so for good men because to them existence is good andpleasant for they are pleased at the consciousness of the presencein them of what is in itself good and if as the virtuous man isto himself he is to his friend also for his friend is another selfifall this be true as his own being is desirable for each man soor almost so is that of his friend now his being was seen to bedesirable because he perceived his own goodness and such perceptionis pleasant in itself he needs therefore to be conscious of theexistence of his friend as well and this will be realized in theirliving together and sharing in discussion and thought for this iswhat living together would seem to mean in the case of man and notas in the case of cattle feeding in the same place if then being is in itself desirable for the supremely happy mansince it is by its nature good and pleasant and that of his friendis very much the same a friend will be one of the things that aredesirable now that which is desirable for him he must have or hewill be deficient in this respect the man who is to be happy willtherefore need virtuous friends  should we then make as many friends as possible oras in the caseof hospitality it is thought to be suitable advice that one shouldbe neither a man of many guests nor a man with nonewill that applyto friendship as well should a man neither be friendless nor havean excessive number of friends to friends made with a view to utility this saying would seem thoroughlyapplicable for to do services to many people in return is a laborioustask and life is not long enough for its performance therefore friendsin excess of those who are sufficient for our own life are superfluousand hindrances to the noble life so that we have no need of themof friends made with a view to pleasure also few are enough asa little seasoning in food is enough but as regards good friends should we have as many as possible oris there a limit to the number of ones friends as there is to thesize of a city you cannot make a city of ten men and if there area hundred thousand it is a city no longer but the proper number ispresumably not a single number but anything that falls between certainfixed points so for friends too there is a fixed number perhaps thelargest number with whom one can live together for that we foundthought to be very characteristic of friendship and that one cannotlive with many people and divide oneself up among them is plain furtherthey too must be friends of one another if they are all to spendtheir days together and it is a hard business for this conditionto be fulfilled with a large number it is found difficult too torejoice and to grieve in an intimate way with many people for itmay likely happen that one has at once to be happy with one friendand to mourn with another presumably then it is well not to seekto have as many friends as possible but as many as are enough forthe purpose of living together for it would seem actually impossibleto be a great friend to many people this is why one cannot love severalpeople love is ideally a sort of excess of friendship and that canonly be felt towards one person therefore great friendship too canonly be felt towards a few people this seems to be confirmed in practicefor we do not find many people who are friends in the comradely wayof friendship and the famous friendships of this sort are alwaysbetween two people those who have many friends and mix intimatelywith them all are thought to be no ones friend except in the wayproper to fellowcitizens and such people are also called obsequiousin the way proper to fellowcitizens indeed it is possible to bethe friend of many and yet not be obsequious but a genuinely goodman but one cannot have with many people the friendship based onvirtue and on the character of our friends themselves and we mustbe content if we find even a few such  do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad they are soughtafter in both for while men in adversity need help in prosperitythey need people to live with and to make the objects of their beneficencefor they wish to do well by others friendship then is more necessaryin bad fortune and so it is useful friends that one wants in thiscase but it is more noble in good fortune and so we also seek forgood men as our friends since it is more desirable to confer benefitson these and to live with these for the very presence of friendsis pleasant both in good fortune and also in bad since grief is lightenedwhen friends sorrow with us hence one might ask whether they shareas it were our burden orwithout that happeningtheir presence byits pleasantness and the thought of their grieving with us makeour pain less whether it is for these reasons or for some other thatour grief is lightened is a question that may be dismissed at allevents what we have described appears to take place but their presence seems to contain a mixture of various factorsthe very seeing of ones friends is pleasant especially if one isin adversity and becomes a safeguard against grief for a friendtends to comfort us both by the sight of him and by his words ifhe is tactful since he knows our character and the things that pleaseor pain us but to see him pained at our misfortunes is painfulfor every one shuns being a cause of pain to his friends for thisreason people of a manly nature guard against making their friendsgrieve with them and unless he be exceptionally insensible to painsuch a man cannot stand the pain that ensues for his friends andin general does not admit fellowmourners because he is not himselfgiven to mourning but women and womanly men enjoy sympathisers intheir grief and love them as friends and companions in sorrow butin all things one obviously ought to imitate the better type of personon the other hand the presence of friends in our prosperity impliesboth a pleasant passing of our time and the pleasant thought of theirpleasure at our own good fortune for this cause it would seem thatwe ought to summon our friends readily to share our good fortunesfor the beneficent character is a noble one but summon them toour bad fortunes with hesitation for we ought to give them as littlea share as possible in our evils whence the saying enough is my misfortunewe should summon friends to us most of all when they are likely bysuffering a few inconveniences to do us a great serviceconversely it is fitting to go unasked and readily to the aid ofthose in adversity for it is characteristic of a friend to renderservices and especially to those who are in need and have not demandedthem such action is nobler and pleasanter for both persons butwhen our friends are prosperous we should join readily in their activitiesfor they need friends for these too but be tardy in coming forwardto be the objects of their kindness for it is not noble to be keento receive benefits still we must no doubt avoid getting the reputationof killjoys by repulsing them for that sometimes happensthe presence of friends then seems desirable in all circumstances does it not follow then that as for lovers the sight of the belovedis the thing they love most and they prefer this sense to the othersbecause on it love depends most for its being and for its originso for friends the most desirable thing is living together for friendshipis a partnership and as a man is to himself so is he to his friendnow in his own case the consciousness of his being is desirable andso therefore is the consciousness of his friends being and the activityof this consciousness is produced when they live together so thatit is natural that they aim at this and whatever existence meansfor each class of men whatever it is for whose sake they value lifein that they wish to occupy themselves with their friends and sosome drink together others dice together others join in athleticexercises and hunting or in the study of philosophy each class spendingtheir days together in whatever they love most in life for sincethey wish to live with their friends they do and share in those thingswhich give them the sense of living together thus the friendshipof bad men turns out an evil thing for because of their instabilitythey unite in bad pursuits and besides they become evil by becominglike each other while the friendship of good men is good beingaugmented by their companionship and they are thought to become bettertoo by their activities and by improving each other for from eachother they take the mould of the characteristics they approvewhencethe saying noble deeds from noble menso much then for friendshipour next task must be to discuss pleasure book x after these matters we ought perhaps next to discuss pleasure forit is thought to be most intimately connected with our human naturewhich is the reason why in educating the young we steer them by therudders of pleasure and pain it is thought too that to enjoy thethings we ought and to hate the things we ought has the greatest bearingon virtue of character for these things extend right through lifewith a weight and power of their own in respect both to virtue andto the happy life since men choose what is pleasant and avoid whatis painful and such things it will be thought we should least ofall omit to discuss especially since they admit of much disputefor some say pleasure is the good while others on the contrarysay it is thoroughly badsome no doubt being persuaded that the factsare so and others thinking it has a better effect on our life toexhibit pleasure as a bad thing even if it is not for most peoplethey think incline towards it and are the slaves of their pleasuresfor which reason they ought to lead them in the opposite directionsince thus they will reach the middle state but surely this is notcorrect for arguments about matters concerned with feelings and actionsare less reliable than facts and so when they clash with the factsof perception they are despised and discredit the truth as wellif a man who runs down pleasure is once seen to be alming at it hisinclining towards it is thought to imply that it is all worthy ofbeing aimed at for most people are not good at drawing distinctionstrue arguments seem then most useful not only with a view to knowledgebut with a view to life also for since they harmonize with the factsthey are believed and so they stimulate those who understand themto live according to themenough of such questions let us proceedto review the opinions that have been expressed about pleasure eudoxus thought pleasure was the good because he saw all things bothrational and irrational aiming at it and because in all things thatwhich is the object of choice is what is excellent and that whichis most the object of choice the greatest good thus the fact thatall things moved towards the same object indicated that this was forall things the chief good for each thing he argued finds its owngood as it finds its own nourishment and that which is good forall things and at which all aim was the good his arguments were creditedmore because of the excellence of his character than for their ownsake he was thought to be remarkably selfcontrolled and thereforeit was thought that he was not saying what he did say as a friendof pleasure but that the facts really were so he believed that thesame conclusion followed no less plainly from a study of the contraryof pleasure pain was in itself an object of aversion to all thingsand therefore its contrary must be similarly an object of choiceand again that is most an object of choice which we choose not becauseor for the sake of something else and pleasure is admittedly of thisnature for no one asks to what end he is pleased thus implying thatpleasure is in itself an object of choice further he argued thatpleasure when added to any good eg to just or temperate actionmakes it more worthy of choice and that it is only by itself thatthe good can be increased this argument seems to show it to be one of the goods and no morea good than any other for every good is more worthy of choice alongwith another good than taken alone and so it is by an argument ofthis kind that plato proves the good not to be pleasure he arguesthat the pleasant life is more desirable with wisdom than withoutand that if the mixture is better pleasure is not the good for thegood cannot become more desirable by the addition of anything to itnow it is clear that nothing else any more than pleasure can bethe good if it is made more desirable by the addition of any of thethings that are good in themselves what then is there that satisfiesthis criterion which at the same time we can participate in it issomething of this sort that we are looking for those who object thatthat at which all things aim is not necessarily good are we may surmisetalking nonsense for we say that that which every one thinks reallyis so and the man who attacks this belief will hardly have anythingmore credible to maintain instead if it is senseless creatures thatdesire the things in question there might be something in what theysay but if intelligent creatures do so as well what sense can therebe in this view but perhaps even in inferior creatures there is somenatural good stronger than themselves which aims at their proper goodnor does the argument about the contrary of pleasure seem to be correctthey say that if pain is an evil it does not follow that pleasureis a good for evil is opposed to evil and at the same time both areopposed to the neutral statewhich is correct enough but does notapply to the things in question for if both pleasure and pain belongedto the class of evils they ought both to be objects of aversion whileif they belonged to the class of neutrals neither should be an objectof aversion or they should both be equally so but in fact peopleevidently avoid the one as evil and choose the other as good thatthen must be the nature of the opposition between them  nor again if pleasure is not a quality does it follow that it isnot a good for the activities of virtue are not qualities eithernor is happiness they say however that the good is determinatewhile pleasure is indeterminate because it admits of degrees nowif it is from the feeling of pleasure that they judge thus the samewill be true of justice and the other virtues in respect of whichwe plainly say that people of a certain character are so more or lessand act more or less in accordance with these virtues for peoplemay be more just or brave and it is possible also to act justly ortemperately more or less but if their judgement is based on the variouspleasures surely they are not stating the real cause if in factsome pleasures are unmixed and others mixed again just as healthadmits of degrees without being indeterminate why should not pleasurethe same proportion is not found in all things nor a single proportionalways in the same thing but it may be relaxed and yet persist upto a point and it may differ in degree the case of pleasure alsomay therefore be of this kind again they assume that the good is perfect while movements and comingsinto being are imperfect and try to exhibit pleasure as being a movementand a coming into being but they do not seem to be right even insaying that it is a movement for speed and slowness are thought tobe proper to every movement and if a movement eg that of the heavenshas not speed or slowness in itself it has it in relation to somethingelse but of pleasure neither of these things is true for while wemay become pleased quickly as we may become angry quickly we cannotbe pleased quickly not even in relation to some one else while wecan walk or grow or the like quickly while then we can changequickly or slowly into a state of pleasure we cannot quickly exhibitthe activity of pleasure ie be pleased again how can it be acoming into being it is not thought that any chance thing can comeout of any chance thing but that a thing is dissolved into that outof which it comes into being and pain would be the destruction ofthat of which pleasure is the coming into being they say too that pain is the lack of that which is according tonature and pleasure is replenishment but these experiences are bodilyif then pleasure is replenishment with that which is according tonature that which feels pleasure will be that in which the replenishmenttakes place ie the body but that is not thought to be the casetherefore the replenishment is not pleasure though one would be pleasedwhen replenishment was taking place just as one would be pained ifone was being operated on this opinion seems to be based on the painsand pleasures connected with nutrition on the fact that when peoplehave been short of food and have felt pain beforehand they are pleasedby the replenishment but this does not happen with all pleasuresfor the pleasures of learning and among the sensuous pleasures thoseof smell and also many sounds and sights and memories and hopesdo not presuppose pain of what then will these be the coming intobeing there has not been lack of anything of which they could bethe supplying anew in reply to those who bring forward the disgraceful pleasures onemay say that these are not pleasant if things are pleasant to peopleof vicious constitution we must not suppose that they are also pleasantto others than these just as we do not reason so about the thingsthat are wholesome or sweet or bitter to sick people or ascribe whitenessto the things that seem white to those suffering from a disease ofthe eye or one might answer thusthat the pleasures are desirablebut not from these sources as wealth is desirable but not as thereward of betrayal and health but not at the cost of eating anythingand everything or perhaps pleasures differ in kind for those derivedfrom noble sources are different from those derived from base sourcesand one cannot the pleasure of the just man without being just northat of the musical man without being musical and so onthe fact too that a friend is different from a flatterer seems tomake it plain that pleasure is not a good or that pleasures are differentin kind for the one is thought to consort with us with a view tothe good the other with a view to our pleasure and the one is reproachedfor his conduct while the other is praised on the ground that he consortswith us for different ends and no one would choose to live with theintellect of a child throughout his life however much he were tobe pleased at the things that children are pleased at nor to getenjoyment by doing some most disgraceful deed though he were neverto feel any pain in consequence and there are many things we shouldbe keen about even if they brought no pleasure eg seeing rememberingknowing possessing the virtues if pleasures necessarily do accompanythese that makes no odds we should choose these even if no pleasureresulted it seems to be clear then that neither is pleasure thegood nor is all pleasure desirable and that some pleasures are desirablein themselves differing in kind or in their sources from the othersso much for the things that are said about pleasure and pain what pleasure is or what kind of thing it is will become plainerif we take up the question aga from the beginning seeing seems tobe at any moment complete for it does not lack anything which cominginto being later will complete its form and pleasure also seems tobe of this nature for it is a whole and at no time can one finda pleasure whose form will be completed if the pleasure lasts longerfor this reason too it is not a movement for every movement egthat of building takes time and is for the sake of an end and iscomplete when it has made what it aims at it is complete thereforeonly in the whole time or at that final moment in their parts andduring the time they occupy all movements are incomplete and aredifferent in kind from the whole movement and from each other forthe fitting together of the stones is different from the fluting ofthe column and these are both different from the making of the templeand the making of the temple is complete for it lacks nothing witha view to the end proposed but the making of the base or of thetriglyph is incomplete for each is the making of only a part theydiffer in kind then and it is not possible to find at any and everytime a movement complete in form but if at all only in the wholetime so too in the case of walking and all other movements forif locomotion is a movement from to there it too has differencesin kindflying walking leaping and so on and not only so butin walking itself there are such differences for the whence and whitherare not the same in the whole racecourse and in a part of it norin one part and in another nor is it the same thing to traverse thisline and that for one traverses not only a line but one which isin a place and this one is in a different place from that we havediscussed movement with precision in another work but it seems thatit is not complete at any and every time but that the many movementsare incomplete and different in kind since the whence and whithergive them their form but of pleasure the form is complete at anyand every time plainly then pleasure and movement must be differentfrom each other and pleasure must be one of the things that are wholeand complete this would seem to be the case too from the fact thatit is not possible to move otherwise than in time but it is possibleto be pleased for that which takes place in a moment is a wholefrom these considerations it is clear too that these thinkers arenot right in saying there is a movement or a coming into being ofpleasure for these cannot be ascribed to all things but only tothose that are divisible and not wholes there is no coming into beingof seeing nor of a point nor of a unit nor is any of these a movementor coming into being therefore there is no movement or coming intobeing of pleasure either for it is a whole since every sense is active in relation to its object and a sensewhich is in good condition acts perfectly in relation to the mostbeautiful of its objects for perfect activity seems to be ideallyof this nature whether we say that it is active or the organ inwhich it resides may be assumed to be immaterial it follows thatin the case of each sense the best activity is that of the bestconditionedorgan in relation to the finest of its objects and this activitywill be the most complete and pleasant for while there is pleasurein respect of any sense and in respect of thought and contemplationno less the most complete is pleasantest and that of a wellconditionedorgan in relation to the worthiest of its objects is the most completeand the pleasure completes the activity but the pleasure does notcomplete it in the same way as the combination of object and senseboth good just as health and the doctor are not in the same way thecause of a mans being healthy that pleasure is produced in respectto each sense is plain for we speak of sights and sounds as pleasantit is also plain that it arises most of all when both the sense isat its best and it is active in reference to an object which correspondswhen both object and perceiver are of the best there will always bepleasure since the requisite agent and patient are both presentpleasure completes the activity not as the corresponding permanentstate does by its immanence but as an end which supervenes as thebloom of youth does on those in the flower of their age so longthen as both the intelligible or sensible object and the discriminatingor contemplative faculty are as they should be the pleasure willbe involved in the activity for when both the passive and the activefactor are unchanged and are related to each other in the same waythe same result naturally follows how then is it that no one is continuously pleased is it that wegrow weary certainly all human beings are incapable of continuousactivity therefore pleasure also is not continuous for it accompaniesactivity some things delight us when they are new but later do soless for the same reason for at first the mind is in a state ofstimulation and intensely active about them as people are with respectto their vision when they look hard at a thing but afterwards ouractivity is not of this kind but has grown relaxed for which reasonthe pleasure also is dulled one might think that all men desire pleasure because they all aimat life life is an activity and each man is active about those thingsand with those faculties that he loves most eg the musician isactive with his hearing in reference to tunes the student with hismind in reference to theoretical questions and so on in each casenow pleasure completes the activities and therefore life which theydesire it is with good reason then that they aim at pleasure toosince for every one it completes life which is desirable but whetherwe choose life for the sake of pleasure or pleasure for the sake oflife is a question we may dismiss for the present for they seem tobe bound up together and not to admit of separation since withoutactivity pleasure does not arise and every activity is completedby the attendant pleasure  for this reason pleasures seem too to differ in kind for thingsdifferent in kind are we think completed by different things wesee this to be true both of natural objects and of things producedby art eg animals trees a painting a sculpture a house animplement and similarly we think that activities differing inkind are completed by things differing in kind now the activitiesof thought differ from those of the senses and both differ amongthemselves in kind so therefore do the pleasures that completethem this may be seen too from the fact that each of the pleasures isbound up with the activity it completes for an activity is intensifiedby its proper pleasure since each class of things is better judgedof and brought to precision by those who engage in the activity withpleasure eg it is those who enjoy geometrical thinking that becomegeometers and grasp the various propositions better and similarlythose who are fond of music or of building and so on make progressin their proper function by enjoying it so the pleasures intensifythe activities and what intensifies a thing is proper to it butthings different in kind have properties different in kindthis will be even more apparent from the fact that activities arehindered by pleasures arising from other sources for people who arefond of playing the flute are incapable of attending to argumentsif they overhear some one playing the flute since they enjoy fluteplayingmore than the activity in hand so the pleasure connected with fluteplayingdestroys the activity concerned with argument this happens similarlyin all other cases when one is active about two things at once themore pleasant activity drives out the other and if it is much morepleasant does so all the more so that one even ceases from the otherthis is why when we enjoy anything very much we do not throw ourselvesinto anything else and do one thing only when we are not much pleasedby another eg in the theatre the people who eat sweets do so mostwhen the actors are poor now since activities are made precise andmore enduring and better by their proper pleasure and injured byalien pleasures evidently the two kinds of pleasure are far apartfor alien pleasures do pretty much what proper pains do since activitiesare destroyed by their proper pains eg if a man finds writing ordoing sums unpleasant and painful he does not write or does notdo sums because the activity is painful so an activity suffers contraryeffects from its proper pleasures and pains ie from those thatsupervene on it in virtue of its own nature and alien pleasures havebeen stated to do much the same as pain they destroy the activityonly not to the same degree now since activities differ in respect of goodness and badness andsome are worthy to be chosen others to be avoided and others neutralso too are the pleasures for to each activity there is a properpleasure the pleasure proper to a worthy activity is good and thatproper to an unworthy activity bad just as the appetites for nobleobjects are laudable those for base objects culpable but the pleasuresinvolved in activities are more proper to them than the desires forthe latter are separated both in time and in nature while the formerare close to the activities and so hard to distinguish from themthat it admits of dispute whether the activity is not the same asthe pleasure still pleasure does not seem to be thought or perceptionthatwould be strange but because they are not found apart they appearto some people the same as activities are different then so arethe corresponding pleasures now sight is superior to touch in purityand hearing and smell to taste the pleasures therefore are similarlysuperior and those of thought superior to these and within eachof the two kinds some are superior to others each animal is thought to have a proper pleasure as it has a properfunction viz that which corresponds to its activity if we surveythem species by species too this will be evident horse dog andman have different pleasures as heraclitus says asses would prefersweepings to gold for food is pleasanter than gold to asses sothe pleasures of creatures different in kind differ in kind and itis plausible to suppose that those of a single species do not differbut they vary to no small extent in the case of men at least thesame things delight some people and pain others and are painful andodious to some and pleasant to and liked by others this happenstoo in the case of sweet things the same things do not seem sweetto a man in a fever and a healthy mannor hot to a weak man and onein good condition the same happens in other cases but in all suchmatters that which appears to the good man is thought to be reallyso if this is correct as it seems to be and virtue and the goodman as such are the measure of each thing those also will be pleasureswhich appear so to him and those things pleasant which he enjoysif the things he finds tiresome seem pleasant to some one that isnothing surprising for men may be ruined and spoilt in many waysbut the things are not pleasant but only pleasant to these peopleand to people in this condition those which are admittedly disgracefulplainly should not be said to be pleasures except to a pervertedtaste but of those that are thought to be good what kind of pleasureor what pleasure should be said to be that proper to man is it notplain from the corresponding activities the pleasures follow thesewhether then the perfect and supremely happy man has one or moreactivities the pleasures that perfect these will be said in the strictsense to be pleasures proper to man and the rest will be so in asecondary and fractional way as are the activities  now that we have spoken of the virtues the forms of friendship andthe varieties of pleasure what remains is to discuss in outline thenature of happiness since this is what we state the end of humannature to be our discussion will be the more concise if we firstsum up what we have said already we said then that it is not adisposition for if it were it might belong to some one who was asleepthroughout his life living the life of a plant or again to someone who was suffering the greatest misfortunes if these implicationsare unacceptable and we must rather class happiness as an activityas we have said before and if some activities are necessary anddesirable for the sake of something else while others are so in themselvesevidently happiness must be placed among those desirable in themselvesnot among those desirable for the sake of something else for happinessdoes not lack anything but is selfsufficient now those activitiesare desirable in themselves from which nothing is sought beyond theactivity and of this nature virtuous actions are thought to be forto do noble and good deeds is a thing desirable for its own sakepleasant amusements also are thought to be of this nature we choosethem not for the sake of other things for we are injured rather thanbenefited by them since we are led to neglect our bodies and ourproperty but most of the people who are deemed happy take refugein such pastimes which is the reason why those who are readywittedat them are highly esteemed at the courts of tyrants they make themselvespleasant companions in the tyrants favourite pursuits and that isthe sort of man they want now these things are thought to be of thenature of happiness because people in despotic positions spend theirleisure in them but perhaps such people prove nothing for virtueand reason from which good activities flow do not depend on despoticposition nor if these people who have never tasted pure and generouspleasure take refuge in the bodily pleasures should these for thatreason be thought more desirable for boys too think the thingsthat are valued among themselves are the best it is to be expectedthen that as different things seem valuable to boys and to menso they should to bad men and to good now as we have often maintainedthose things are both valuable and pleasant which are such to thegood man and to each man the activity in accordance with his owndisposition is most desirable and therefore to the good man thatwhich is in accordance with virtue happiness therefore does notlie in amusement it would indeed be strange if the end were amusementand one were to take trouble and suffer hardship all ones life inorder to amuse oneself for in a word everything that we choosewe choose for the sake of something elseexcept happiness which isan end now to exert oneself and work for the sake of amusement seemssilly and utterly childish but to amuse oneself in order that onemay exert oneself as anacharsis puts it seems right for amusementis a sort of relaxation and we need relaxation because we cannotwork continuously relaxation then is not an end for it is takenfor the sake of activity the happy life is thought to be virtuous now a virtuous life requiresexertion and does not consist in amusement and we say that seriousthings are better than laughable things and those connected with amusementand that the activity of the better of any two thingswhether it betwo elements of our being or two menis the more serious but theactivity of the better is ipso facto superior and more of the natureof happiness and any chance personeven a slavecan enjoy the bodilypleasures no less than the best man but no one assigns to a slavea share in happinessunless he assigns to him also a share in humanlife for happiness does not lie in such occupations but as we havesaid before in virtuous activities  if happiness is activity in accordance with virtue it is reasonablethat it should be in accordance with the highest virtue and thiswill be that of the best thing in us whether it be reason or somethingelse that is this element which is thought to be our natural rulerand guide and to take thought of things noble and divine whetherit be itself also divine or only the most divine element in us theactivity of this in accordance with its proper virtue will be perfecthappiness that this activity is contemplative we have already saidnow this would seem to be in agreement both with what we said beforeand with the truth for firstly this activity is the best sincenot only is reason the best thing in us but the objects of reasonare the best of knowable objects and secondly it is the most continuoussince we can contemplate truth more continuously than we can do anythingand we think happiness has pleasure mingled with it but the activityof philosophic wisdom is admittedly the pleasantest of virtuous activitiesat all events the pursuit of it is thought to offer pleasures marvellousfor their purity and their enduringness and it is to be expectedthat those who know will pass their time more pleasantly than thosewho inquire and the selfsufficiency that is spoken of must belongmost to the contemplative activity for while a philosopher as wellas a just man or one possessing any other virtue needs the necessariesof life when they are sufficiently equipped with things of that sortthe just man needs people towards whom and with whom he shall actjustly and the temperate man the brave man and each of the othersis in the same case but the philosopher even when by himself cancontemplate truth and the better the wiser he is he can perhapsdo so better if he has fellowworkers but still he is the most selfsufficientand this activity alone would seem to be loved for its own sake fornothing arises from it apart from the contemplating while from practicalactivities we gain more or less apart from the action and happinessis thought to depend on leisure for we are busy that we may haveleisure and make war that we may live in peace now the activityof the practical virtues is exhibited in political or military affairsbut the actions concerned with these seem to be unleisurely warlikeactions are completely so for no one chooses to be at war or provokeswar for the sake of being at war any one would seem absolutely murderousif he were to make enemies of his friends in order to bring aboutbattle and slaughter but the action of the statesman is also unleisurelyandapart from the political action itselfaims at despotic powerand honours or at all events happiness for him and his fellow citizensahappiness different from political action and evidently sought asbeing different so if among virtuous actions political and militaryactions are distinguished by nobility and greatness and these areunleisurely and aim at an end and are not desirable for their ownsake but the activity of reason which is contemplative seems bothto be superior in serious worth and to aim at no end beyond itselfand to have its pleasure proper to itself and this augments the activityand the selfsufficiency leisureliness unweariedness so far asthis is possible for man and all the other attributes ascribed tothe supremely happy man are evidently those connected with this activityit follows that this will be the complete happiness of man if itbe allowed a complete term of life for none of the attributes ofhappiness is incomplete but such a life would be too high for man for it is not in so faras he is man that he will live so but in so far as something divineis present in him and by so much as this is superior to our compositenature is its activity superior to that which is the exercise of theother kind of virtue if reason is divine then in comparison withman the life according to it is divine in comparison with human lifebut we must not follow those who advise us being men to think ofhuman things and being mortal of mortal things but must so faras we can make ourselves immortal and strain every nerve to livein accordance with the best thing in us for even if it be small inbulk much more does it in power and worth surpass everything thiswould seem too to be each man himself since it is the authoritativeand better part of him it would be strange then if he were to choosenot the life of his self but that of something else and what we saidbefore will apply now that which is proper to each thing is by naturebest and most pleasant for each thing for man therefore the lifeaccording to reason is best and pleasantest since reason more thananything else is man this life therefore is also the happiest but in a secondary degree the life in accordance with the other kindof virtue is happy for the activities in accordance with this befitour human estate just and brave acts and other virtuous acts wedo in relation to each other observing our respective duties withregard to contracts and services and all manner of actions and withregard to passions and all of these seem to be typically human someof them seem even to arise from the body and virtue of characterto be in many ways bound up with the passions practical wisdom toois linked to virtue of character and this to practical wisdom sincethe principles of practical wisdom are in accordance with the moralvirtues and rightness in morals is in accordance with practical wisdombeing connected with the passions also the moral virtues must belongto our composite nature and the virtues of our composite nature arehuman so therefore are the life and the happiness which correspondto these the excellence of the reason is a thing apart we must becontent to say this much about it for to describe it precisely isa task greater than our purpose requires it would seem howeveralso to need external equipment but little or less than moral virtuedoes grant that both need the necessaries and do so equally evenif the statesmans work is the more concerned with the body and thingsof that sort for there will be little difference there but in whatthey need for the exercise of their activities there will be muchdifference the liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberaldeeds and the just man too will need it for the returning of servicesfor wishes are hard to discern and even people who are not justpretend to wish to act justly and the brave man will need powerif he is to accomplish any of the acts that correspond to his virtueand the temperate man will need opportunity for how else is eitherhe or any of the others to be recognized it is debated too whetherthe will or the deed is more essential to virtue which is assumedto involve both it is surely clear that its perfection involves bothbut for deeds many things are needed and more the greater and noblerthe deeds are but the man who is contemplating the truth needs nosuch thing at least with a view to the exercise of his activityindeed they are one may say even hindrances at all events to hiscontemplation but in so far as he is a man and lives with a numberof people he chooses to do virtuous acts he will therefore needsuch aids to living a human life but that perfect happiness is a contemplative activity will appearfrom the following consideration as well we assume the gods to beabove all other beings blessed and happy but what sort of actionsmust we assign to them acts of justice will not the gods seem absurdif they make contracts and return deposits and so on acts of a braveman then confronting dangers and running risks because it is nobleto do so or liberal acts to whom will they give it will be strangeif they are really to have money or anything of the kind and whatwould their temperate acts be is not such praise tasteless sincethey have no bad appetites if we were to run through them all thecircumstances of action would be found trivial and unworthy of godsstill every one supposes that they live and therefore that they areactive we cannot suppose them to sleep like endymion now if youtake away from a living being action and still more production whatis left but contemplation therefore the activity of god which surpassesall others in blessedness must be contemplative and of human activitiestherefore that which is most akin to this must be most of the natureof happiness this is indicated too by the fact that the other animals have noshare in happiness being completely deprived of such activity forwhile the whole life of the gods is blessed and that of men too inso far as some likeness of such activity belongs to them none ofthe other animals is happy since they in no way share in contemplationhappiness extends then just so far as contemplation does and thoseto whom contemplation more fully belongs are more truly happy notas a mere concomitant but in virtue of the contemplation for thisis in itself precious happiness therefore must be some form ofcontemplation but being a man one will also need external prosperity for ournature is not selfsufficient for the purpose of contemplation butour body also must be healthy and must have food and other attentionstill we must not think that the man who is to be happy will needmany things or great things merely because he cannot be supremelyhappy without external goods for selfsufficiency and action do notinvolve excess and we can do noble acts without ruling earth andsea for even with moderate advantages one can act virtuously thisis manifest enough for private persons are thought to do worthy actsno less than despotsindeed even more and it is enough that we shouldhave so much as that for the life of the man who is active in accordancewith virtue will be happy solon too was perhaps sketching wellthe happy man when he described him as moderately furnished with externalsbut as having done as solon thought the noblest acts and livedtemperately for one can with but moderate possessions do what oneought anaxagoras also seems to have supposed the happy man not tobe rich nor a despot when he said that he would not be surprisedif the happy man were to seem to most people a strange person forthey judge by externals since these are all they perceive the opinionsof the wise seem then to harmonize with our arguments but whileeven such things carry some conviction the truth in practical mattersis discerned from the facts of life for these are the decisive factorwe must therefore survey what we have already said bringing it tothe test of the facts of life and if it harmonizes with the factswe must accept it but if it clashes with them we must suppose itto be mere theory now he who exercises his reason and cultivatesit seems to be both in the best state of mind and most dear to thegods for if the gods have any care for human affairs as they arethought to have it would be reasonable both that they should delightin that which was best and most akin to them ie reason and thatthey should reward those who love and honour this most as caringfor the things that are dear to them and acting both rightly and noblyand that all these attributes belong most of all to the philosopheris manifest he therefore is the dearest to the gods and he whois that will presumably be also the happiest so that in this waytoo the philosopher will more than any other be happy  if these matters and the virtues and also friendship and pleasurehave been dealt with sufficiently in outline are we to suppose thatour programme has reached its end surely as the saying goes wherethere are things to be done the end is not to survey and recognizethe various things but rather to do them with regard to virtuethen it is not enough to know but we must try to have and use itor try any other way there may be of becoming good now if argumentswere in themselves enough to make men good they would justly astheognis says have won very great rewards and such rewards shouldhave been provided but as things are while they seem to have powerto encourage and stimulate the generousminded among our youth andto make a character which is gently born and a true lover of whatis noble ready to be possessed by virtue they are not able to encouragethe many to nobility and goodness for these do not by nature obeythe sense of shame but only fear and do not abstain from bad actsbecause of their baseness but through fear of punishment living bypassion they pursue their own pleasures and the means to them andand the opposite pains and have not even a conception of what isnoble and truly pleasant since they have never tasted it what argumentwould remould such people it is hard if not impossible to removeby argument the traits that have long since been incorporated in thecharacter and perhaps we must be content if when all the influencesby which we are thought to become good are present we get some tinctureof virtue now some think that we are made good by nature others by habituationothers by teaching natures part evidently does not depend on usbut as a result of some divine causes is present in those who aretruly fortunate while argument and teaching we may suspect arenot powerful with all men but the soul of the student must firsthave been cultivated by means of habits for noble joy and noble hatredlike earth which is to nourish the seed for he who lives as passiondirects will not hear argument that dissuades him nor understandit if he does and how can we persuade one in such a state to changehis ways and in general passion seems to yield not to argument butto force the character then must somehow be there already witha kinship to virtue loving what is noble and hating what is basebut it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtueif one has not been brought up under right laws for to live temperatelyand hardily is not pleasant to most people especially when they areyoung for this reason their nurture and occupations should be fixedby law for they will not be painful when they have become customarybut it is surely not enough that when they are young they should getthe right nurture and attention since they must even when they aregrown up practise and be habituated to them we shall need laws forthis as well and generally speaking to cover the whole of life formost people obey necessity rather than argument and punishments ratherthan the sense of what is noble this is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men tovirtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble on the assumptionthat those who have been well advanced by the formation of habitswill attend to such influences and that punishments and penaltiesshould be imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior naturewhile the incurably bad should be completely banished a good manthey think since he lives with his mind fixed on what is noblewill submit to argument while a bad man whose desire is for pleasureis corrected by pain like a beast of burden this is too why theysay the pains inflicted should be those that are most opposed to thepleasures such men love however that may be if as we have said the man who is to be goodmust be well trained and habituated and go on to spend his time inworthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad actionsand if this can be brought about if men live in accordance with asort of reason and right order provided this has forceif this beso the paternal command indeed has not the required force or compulsivepower nor in general has the command of one man unless he be a kingor something similar but the law has compulsive power while itis at the same time a rule proceeding from a sort of practical wisdomand reason and while people hate men who oppose their impulses evenif they oppose them rightly the law in its ordaining of what is goodis not burdensome in the spartan state alone or almost alone the legislator seemsto have paid attention to questions of nurture and occupations inmost states such matters have been neglected and each man lives ashe pleases cyclopsfashion to his own wife and children dealinglaw now it is best that there should be a public and proper carefor such matters but if they are neglected by the community it wouldseem right for each man to help his children and friends towards virtueand that they should have the power or at least the will to do thisit would seem from what has been said that he can do this better ifhe makes himself capable of legislating for public control is plainlyeffected by laws and good control by good laws whether written orunwritten would seem to make no difference nor whether they are lawsproviding for the education of individuals or of groupsany more thanit does in the case of music or gymnastics and other such pursuitsfor as in cities laws and prevailing types of character have forceso in households do the injunctions and the habits of the fatherand these have even more because of the tie of blood and the benefitshe confers for the children start with a natural affection and dispositionto obey further private education has an advantage over publicas private medical treatment has for while in general rest and abstinencefrom food are good for a man in a fever for a particular man theymay not be and a boxer presumably does not prescribe the same styleof fighting to all his pupils it would seem then that the detailis worked out with more precision if the control is private for eachperson is more likely to get what suits his case but the details can be best looked after one by one by a doctoror gymnastic instructor or any one else who has the general knowledgeof what is good for every one or for people of a certain kind forthe sciences both are said to be and are concerned with what isuniversal not but what some particular detail may perhaps be welllooked after by an unscientific person if he has studied accuratelyin the light of experience what happens in each case just as somepeople seem to be their own best doctors though they could give nohelp to any one else none the less it will perhaps be agreed thatif a man does wish to become master of an art or science he must goto the universal and come to know it as well as possible for aswe have said it is with this that the sciences are concernedand surely he who wants to make men whether many or few better byhis care must try to become capable of legislating if it is throughlaws that we can become good for to get any one whateverany onewho is put before usinto the right condition is not for the firstchance comer if any one can do it it is the man who knows justas in medicine and all other matters which give scope for care andprudence must we not then next examine whence or how one can learn how tolegislate is it as in all other cases from statesmen certainlyit was thought to be a part of statesmanship or is a difference apparentbetween statesmanship and the other sciences and arts in the othersthe same people are found offering to teach the arts and practisingthem eg doctors or painters but while the sophists profess toteach politics it is practised not by any of them but by the politicianswho would seem to do so by dint of a certain skill and experiencerather than of thought for they are not found either writing or speakingabout such matters though it were a nobler occupation perhaps thancomposing speeches for the lawcourts and the assembly nor againare they found to have made statesmen of their own sons or any otherof their friends but it was to be expected that they should if theycould for there is nothing better than such a skill that they couldhave left to their cities or could prefer to have for themselvesor therefore for those dearest to them still experience seemsto contribute not a little else they could not have become politiciansby familiarity with politics and so it seems that those who aim atknowing about the art of politics need experience as wellbut those of the sophists who profess the art seem to be very farfrom teaching it for to put the matter generally they do not evenknow what kind of thing it is nor what kinds of things it is aboutotherwise they would not have classed it as identical with rhetoricor even inferior to it nor have thought it easy to legislate by collectingthe laws that are thought well of they say it is possible to selectthe best laws as though even the selection did not demand intelligenceand as though right judgement were not the greatest thing as in mattersof music for while people experienced in any department judge rightlythe works produced in it and understand by what means or how theyare achieved and what harmonizes with what the inexperienced mustbe content if they do not fail to see whether the work has been wellor ill madeas in the case of painting now laws are as it were theworks of the political art how then can one learn from them to bea legislator or judge which are best even medical men do not seemto be made by a study of textbooks yet people try at any rateto state not only the treatments but also how particular classesof people can be cured and should be treateddistinguishing the varioushabits of body but while this seems useful to experienced peopleto the inexperienced it is valueless surely then while collectionsof laws and of constitutions also may be serviceable to those whocan study them and judge what is good or bad and what enactments suitwhat circumstances those who go through such collections withouta practised faculty will not have right judgement unless it be asa spontaneous gift of nature though they may perhaps become moreintelligent in such matters now our predecessors have left the subject of legislation to us unexaminedit is perhaps best therefore that we should ourselves study itand in general study the question of the constitution in order tocomplete to the best of our ability our philosophy of human naturefirst then if anything has been said well in detail by earlier thinkerslet us try to review it then in the light of the constitutions wehave collected let us study what sorts of influence preserve and destroystates and what sorts preserve or destroy the particular kinds ofconstitution and to what causes it is due that some are well andothers ill administered when these have been studied we shall perhapsbe more likely to see with a comprehensive view which constitutionis best and how each must be ordered and what laws and customs itmust use if it is to be at its best let us make a beginning of ourdiscussion the end
